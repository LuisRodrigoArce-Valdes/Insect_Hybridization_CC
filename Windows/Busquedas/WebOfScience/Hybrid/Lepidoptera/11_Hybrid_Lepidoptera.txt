Molecular evidence for hybridization in Colias (Lepidoptera: Pieridae): are Colias hybrids really hybrids?

In North American Colias eurytheme and Colias eriphyle, there has been historical debate over the extent of hybridization occurring and the identity of phenotypically intermediate individuals as genetic hybrids. This study assesses the population structure of these two species to measure the extent of hybridization and the genetic identity of phenotypic intermediates as hybrids. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker analysis was performed on 378 specimens collected from northern California and Nevada. Population structure was inferred using a Bayesian/Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which probabilistically assigns individuals to genetic clusters. Three genetic clusters provided the best fit for the data. C.eurytheme individuals were primarily assigned to two closely related clusters, and C.eriphyle individuals were mostly assigned to a third, more distantly related cluster. There appeared to be significant hybridization between the two species. Individuals of intermediate phenotype (putative hybrids) were found to be genetically indistinguishable from C.eriphyle, indicating that previous work based on the assumption that these intermediate forms are hybrids may warrant reconsideration.

The Fl of H. armigera female and H. assulta male had only male, no female sex. In this case Haldane's rule applies, and therefore it is proved that the sex chromosomes of Helicoverpa species are of ZW type, and the female is the heterozygous sex. This hybrid also showed significant heterosis with the heaviest pupal weight, and when it was backcrossed with H. armigera female, the sex ratio of the BC offspring was distorted as 1 : 4. The potential utilization of this hybrid in genetic controlling H, armigera was finally discussed.

Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa zea hybridization: constraints, heterosis, and implications for pest management	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						agricultural pests; alien species; heterosis; hybridization; introgression; reproductive parameters	HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA-NOCTUIDAE; TOBACCO BUDWORM LEPIDOPTERA; HELIOTHIS-ZEA; COTTON BOLLWORM; SEX-PHEROMONE; CORN-EARWORM; MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS; PYRETHROID-RESISTANCE; ASSULTA LEPIDOPTERA	BACKGROUND The invasion of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) into the New World has made it possible for this pest to hybridize with a native American species, H. zea (Boddie), under natural conditions. We investigated the viability and development of hybrids of these two Helicoverpa species. We reared the parental species and evaluated crosses between H. armigera males and H. zea females and vice versa, two intercrosses between hybrids, and eight backcrosses between hybrids and parental species. We estimated the length of immature stages, fecundity, survival, sex ratio, and heterosis. RESULTS Although hybridization occcurred, with heterosis during the development of immatures, reproductive incompatibilities also were observed between the parental species and between hybrids from subsequent crosses. The interspecific crosses between hybrids and backcrosses confirmed the possibility of introgression events and their perpetuation in field populations. The results indicate that hybridization events are favored at high population levels, while at low population levels the 'species identities' will be maintained. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of interspecific gene flow and its perpetuation through successive crosses and backcrosses suggests several recommenations for management. Populations of both species should be maintained at an equilibrium level to reduce the chance of interspecific crosses, which are presumably more likely to occur during pest outbreaks. The existence of hybridization and resistance to different active pesticide ingredients should be monitored. All practices related to managing the resistance of these pests to chemical and biological insecticides should be systematized to reduce the chance of selecting for resistant individuals.

Using genetic distance as a proxy for time, I investigate the time-course of the evolution of postzygotic isolation and the waiting times to particular hybrid fitness problems. The results show that postzygotic isolation increases gradually as species diverge, but that hybrid sterility evolves faster than hybrid inviability. The overwhelming preponderance of female-specific hybrid problems in Lepidoptera shows that Haldane's rule (the preferential sterility or inviability of the heterogametic sex) is well obeyed. Together the rates and patterns characterizing the accumulation of postzygotic isolation allow several tests of the composite theory of Haldane's rule. Interestingly, comparing these data with those from Drosophila reveals that Haldane's rule for sterility evolves Lis fast (if not faster) in Lepidoptera. Finally, I show that a substantial fraction of sympatric species hybridizes in nature and that the majority of these suffer some level of hybrid sterility or inviability.

A TRANSECT FOR REPRODUCTIVE COMPATIBILITY AND EVIDENCE FOR A "HYBRID SINK" IN A HYBRID ZONE OF HYALOPHORA (INSECTA: LEPIDOPTERA: SATURNIIDAE)	ANNALS OF CARNEGIE MUSEUM			English	Article						hybrid fitness; hybrid sink; hybridization; introgression; postzygotic isolation; species boundaries; tension zone		Egg fertility, embryo viability, and fecundity were measured, using experimental hybridization, to produce a profile of reproductive compatibility across a hybrid zone between Hyalophora eznyalus (Boisduval, 1855) and H. columbia gloveri (Strecker, 1872) (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Three aspects of the genetic structure of the hybrid zone are discussed: 1) hybrid zone females have normal fecundity, in contrast to typically barren laboratory-reared F-1 hybrid females from crosses between widely allopatric parental taxa; 2) hybrid zone females from defined sites along the transect, in comparison to allopatric species matings, showed no reduction in fertility or viability in matings with males from the same site; and 3) a "hybrid sink" was discovered, the moths from which were the least compatible among various inter-site crosses. Topography affects the genetic structure of the hybrid zone, especially by reducing gene flow in relation to rain shadows and associated ecological features. Within the hybrid zone, natural selection has apparently modified postzygotic isolation by favoring compatible genotypes regulating oogenesis. The long-term structure and stability of the hybrid zone is discussed in terms of ecological heterogeneity in complex montane landscapes. The suitability of the "tension zone" model, which depicts an equilibrium between the effects of selection balanced against dispersal, is discussed for the Hyalophora hybrid zone.

Survey for Winter Moth (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in Northeastern North America With Pheromone-Baited Traps and Hybridization With the Native Bruce Spanworm (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						forest defoliator; hybridization; invasive species; pheromone trap survey; DNA barcoding	OPEROPHTERA-BRUMATA L; NOVA-SCOTIA; EPIRRITA-AUTUMNATA; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; HULST LEPIDOPTERA; APPLE ORCHARDS; SEX-PHEROMONE; POPULATIONS; DNA; PARASITISM	We used pheromone-baited traps to survey the distribution of winter moth, Operophtera brumata (L.) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), a new invasive defoliator from Europe in eastern New England. The traps also attracted Bruce spanworm, Operophtera bruceata (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), native to North America. We distinguished between the two species by examining male genitalia and sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, the DNA barcoding region. In 2005, we recovered winter moths at sites stretching from eastern Long Island, southeastern Connecticut, all of Rhode Island, eastern Massachusetts, coastal New Hampshire, and southern coastal Maine, At sites further west and north we captured only Bruce spanworm. In 2006, we confirmed that both winter moth and Bruce spanworm are present in Nova Scotia and in coastal Maine, bill only Bruce spanworm was recovered in coastal New Brunswick, Canada; Pennsylvania; Vermont; or Quebec City, Canada. In 2007, we collected Bruce spanworm, bill no winter moths, in New Brunswick and the interior areas of Maine, New Hampshire, and New York. Winter, moth and Bruce spanworm differed in the COI sequence by 7.45% of their nucleotides. The prevalence of intermediate genitalia in the zone of overlap suggested that hybridization between the two species may be occurring. To confirm the presence of hybrids, we sequenced the nuclear gene, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (C6PD). We, identified six nucleotides that routinely distinguished winter moth and Bruce spanworm, of which three were always diagnostic. We showed that eggs produced by hybridizing the two species in the laboratory contained copies of both species at these six sites. We found that most of the moths collected in the field with intermediate genitalia had winter moth COI and GOD sequences and thus were not hybrids (or at least F1 hybrids). We found three hybrids out of 158 moths with intermediate genitalia in the region both species were caught. We conclude that hybrids occur in nature, but are not its common as previously reported. Introgression of genes between the two species may still be significant.

The F-1 hybrid females from crosses between H. virescens male and H. subflexa female did not produce sex pheromone during a distinct period in the scotophase. The mean amounts of pheromone present in extracts obtained from insects sampled at 1 h intervals remained relatively constant from the second to ninth hours of the scotophase. Hybrid females from the reciprocal cross (H. subflexa male x H. virescens female) had peak pheromone production at the sixth hour of the scotophase. Homogenates of cephalic ganglia obtained from either of the hybrid lines stimulated pheromone production when injected into either of the parent species or either of the F-1 hybrid lines during the photophase. Thus, F-1 females had the capacity to produce pheromone and pheromonotropic substances were present in the cephalic ganglia. We conclude that hybridization between H. virescens male and H. subflexa female affected the endogenous release of pheromonotropic substances from the cephalic ganglia.

Distribution changes brought about by climate change are likely to alter levels of hybridisation between related taxa, and may threaten some species. 2. Nuclear (Tpi) and mitochondrial (cytB) DNA sequence data give evidence for introgression between two related Polyommatus (subgenus Aricia) butterfly species in a 150-200 km wide overlap zone in northern England and North Wales. A history of hybridisation is evident from the mixture of genotypes present within this region: some populations contain southern-origin (Polyommatus agestis) mtDNA and northern-origin (Polyommatus artaxerxes) Tpi alleles, and many populations contain mixtures of Tpi alleles. 3. The timing of the original hybridisation is unknown, but could be immediately post-glacial or much more recent in origin. 4. Both species are now beginning to shift northwards, associated with recent climatic warming. 5. It is thus expected that anthropogenic climate change will unleash a new spate of hybridisation, potentially threatening the long-term survival of the northern species in Britain.

The cross between females of H. armigera and males of H. assulta yielded only fertile males and sterile individuals lacking an aedeagus, valva or ostium bursae. A total of 492 larvae of the H. generation were obtained and 374 of these completed larval development and pupated. Only 203 pupae were morphologically normal males, the remaining 171 pupae were malformed. Larvae and pupae that gave rise to morphologically abnormal adults exhibited longer development times. Sterility was not only associated with malformed external sex organs, but also a range of abnormalities of the internal reproductive system: (i) loss of internal reproductive organs, (ii) with one to three copies of an undeveloped bursa copulatrix; or (iii) with one or two undeveloped testes. Normal male hybrid adults showed higher flight activity in comparison with males of both species. In contrast, the cross between females of H. assulta and males of H. armigera yielded morphologically normal offspring (80 males and 83 females). The interaction of the Z-chromosome from H. assulta with autosomes from H. armigera might result in morphological abnormalities found in hybrids and backcrosses, and maternal-zygotic incompatibilities might contribute to sex bias attributed to hybrid inviability.

Identification of Natural Hybrids between Ahlbergia frivaldszkyi (Lederer, 1853) and Callophrys rubi (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) Using Mitochondrial and Nuclear Markers	INSECTS			English	Article						elfin butterflies; interspecific hybridization; intergeneric hybrids	BUTTERFLIES LEPIDOPTERA; MOLECULAR EVIDENCE; DNA; HYBRIDIZATION; INTROGRESSION; PHYLOGENY; PRIMERS; COMPLEX	Simple Summary Butterfly specimens with unusual morphological characters (e.g., unusual wing coloration) have contradictory interpretations in the literature and have been considered by different authors either as previously undescribed taxa, putative hybrids, or aberrations of well-known species. Such individuals clearly represent a taxonomic problem that needs to be addressed by scientists. The application of molecular techniques could shed light on the origin of morphological uncertainty. Here we use a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers to analyze three lycaenid butterflies with unusual wing pattern, which are thought to represent naturally occurring hybrids due to their intermediate phenotype. We confirm their hybrid origin and indicate that the specimens are wild-caught hybrids between females of Callophrys rubi and males of Ahlbergia frivaldszkyi. Our data indicate that gene flow across species boundaries in these butterflies can occur long after speciation. Natural hybridization is rather widespread and common in animals and can have important evolutionary consequences. In terms of taxonomy, exploring hybridization and introgression is crucial in defining species boundaries and testing taxonomic hypotheses. In the present paper, we report on natural hybrid specimens between Ahlbergia frivaldszkyi (Lederer, 1853) and Callophrys rubi (Linnaeus, 1758). To test the hypothesis of their hybrid origin, we employed the molecular mitochondrial (COI gene) and nuclear (wingless, RPS5, and Ca-ATPase genes) markers commonly used in phylogenetic studies and explored the morphology of the specimens. Our analysis revealed that hybrids bear mitochondrial haplotypes of C. rubi, while nuclear fragments are heterozygous, sharing a combination of A. frivaldszkyi and C. rubi lineages. The hybrid specimens combine morphological characters of both genera. Our results for the first time empirically demonstrate the possibility of genetic introgression between these species and between the genera Callophrys and Ahlbergia on the whole.

Real-time geographic settling of a hybrid zone between the invasive winter moth (Operophtera brumata L.) and the native Bruce spanworm (O. bruceata Hulst)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						forest pest; hybrid fitness; introgression; Lepidoptera; tension zone	NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; PHEROMONE-BAITED TRAPS; LEPIDOPTERA-GEOMETRIDAE; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; PUPAL PREDATORS; HYBRIDIZATION; EXTINCTION; POPULATION; INFERENCE; INTROGRESSION	Hybridization plays an important and underappreciated role in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of species. Following the introduction of a non-native organism to a novel habitat, hybridization with a native congener may affect the probability of establishment of the introduced species. In most documented cases of hybridization between a native and a non-native species, a mosaic hybrid zone is formed, with hybridization occurring heterogeneously across the landscape. In contrast, most naturally occurring hybrid zones are clinal in structure. Here, we report on a long-term microsatellite data set that monitored hybridization between the invasive winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), and the native Bruce spanworm, O. bruceata, over a 12-year period. Our results document one of the first examples of the real-time formation and geographic settling of a clinal hybrid zone. In addition, by comparing one transect in Massachusetts where extreme winter cold temperatures have been hypothesized to restrict the distribution of winter moth, and one in coastal Connecticut, where winter temperatures are moderated by Long Island Sound, we found that the location of the hybrid zone appeared to be independent of environmental variables and maintained under a tension model wherein the stability of the hybrid zone was constrained by population density, reduced hybrid fitness, and low dispersal rates. Documenting the formation of a contemporary clinal hybrid zone may provide important insights into the factors that shaped other well-established hybrid zones.

Asymmetric hybridization between non-native winter moth, Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), and native Bruce spanworm, Operophtera bruceata, in the Northeastern United States, assessed with novel microsatellites and SNPs	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						hybridization; invasive species; microsatellite development; next generation sequencing; RAD-seq	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; HULST LEPIDOPTERA; NORTH-AMERICA; O-BRUCEATA; PHEROMONE; SOFTWARE; DNA; INFERENCE; INVASION; PROGRAM	The European winter moth, Operophtera brumata, is a non-native pest in the Northeastern USA causing defoliation of forest trees and crops such as apples and blueberries. This species is known to hybridize with O. bruceata, the Bruce spanworm, a native species across North America, although it is not known if there are hybrid generations beyond F1. To study winter moth population genetics and hybridization with Bruce spanworm, we developed two sets of genetic markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites, using genomic approaches. Both types of markers were validated using samples from the two species and their hybrids. We identified 1216 SNPs and 24 variable microsatellite loci. From them we developed a subset of 95 species-diagnostic SNPs and ten microsatellite loci that could be used for hybrid identification. We further validated the ten microsatellite loci by screening field collected samples of both species and putative hybrids. In addition to confirming the presence of F1 hybrids reported in previous studies, we found evidence for multi-generation asymmetric hybridization, as suggested by the occurrence of hybrid backcrosses with the winter month, but not with the Bruce spanworm. Laboratory crosses between winter moth females and Bruce spanworm males resulted in a higher proportion of viable eggs than the reciprocal cross, supporting this pattern. We discuss the possible roles of population demographics, sex chromosome genetic incompatibility, and bacterial symbionts as causes of this asymmetrical hybridization and the utility of the developed markers for future studies.

Very low frequencies of F-1 hybrids were detected in both Sardinia (0-4%, average 1.4%) and Corsica (0-3%, average 0.5%), as well as of first generation backcrosses (B-1 ). No F-2 were observed, in agreement with the hybrid breakdown detected in laboratory crosses. In spite of this minimal current gene exchange, specimens carrying introgressed alleles were found in high proportions in P. machaon but in lower proportions in P. hospiton . Introgression apparently occurred through past hybridization and repeated backcrossing, as evidenced by hybrid index scores and Bayesian assignment tests. Levels of introgression were low (0-1%) at two sex-linked loci and mitochondrial DNA, limited (0.4-2%) at three autosomal loci coding for dimeric enzymes, and high (up to 43%) at four autosomal loci coding for monomeric enzymes. Accordingly, selective filters are acting against foreign alleles, with differential effectiveness depending on the loci involved. The low levels of introgression at sex-linked loci and mitochondrial DNA are in agreement with Haldane's rule and suggest that introgression in P. machaon proceeds mainly through males, owing to a lower fitness of hybrid females. Papilio machaon populations showed higher levels of introgression in Sardinia than in Corsica. The role of reinforcement in the present reproductive isolation between P. machaon and P. hospiton is examined, as well as the evolutionary effects of introgressive hybridization between the two species.

Most studies have focused on the nature of incompatibilities in the hybrid male, but not much attention has been given to the genetic basis of fertility and inviability in hybrid females. Hybridizations between Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana produce fertile females and sterile males. Here, we re-examined the level of fertility in reciprocal F1 females of these two species and looked for the presence of maternal effects. Our results show that the reciprocal F1 females of D. simulans and D. mauritiana hybridizations are fully fertile and in fact show a significant level of heterosis in the rate of oviposition but display reduced egg hatching in one direction. Reduced egg hatching was observed in the progenies of F1 hybrid females with D. mauritiana as mother, the same cross that showed a stronger negative effect on F1 male fertility. A review of the literature on the hybridizations in Lepidoptera also showed a maternal effect on inviability when reciprocal crosses produced asymmetric results. Our findings point to the importance of maternal effects in the evolution of embryo inviability and thus enhancing the process of speciation through the evolution of hybrid inviability.

New methods in population genomics and statistical model testing now allow the disentangling of the complexity that hybridization brings into key evolutionary processes such as local adaptation, colonization of new environments, species diversification and extinction. We evaluated the consequences of hybridization in a complex of three alpine butterflies in the genus Coenonympha, by combining morphological, genetic and ecological analyses. A series of approximate Bayesian computation procedures based on a large SNP data set strongly suggest that the Darwin's Heath (Coenonympha darwiniana) originated through hybridization between the Pearly Heath (Coenonympha arcania) and the Alpine Heath (Coenonympha gardetta) with different parental contributions. As a result of hybridization, the Darwin's Heath presents an intermediate morphology between the parental species, while its climatic niche seems more similar to the Alpine Heath. Our results also reveal a substantial genetic and morphologic differentiation between the two geographically disjoint Darwin's Heath lineages leading us to propose the splitting of this taxon into two different species.

In the Americas, a native pest, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and an invasive pest, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner),are causing severe damage in vegetable and agronomic crops. The population structure of both species in South America is poorly understood, and the phylogenetic relatedness of H. armigera and H. zea suggests natural interspecific gene flow between these species. Using microsatellite loci, we investigated: 1) the genetic diversity and gene flow of H. armigera specimens from Brazil; 2) the genetic diversity and gene flow between H. zea specimens from Brazil and the United States; and 3) the possibility of interspecific gene flow and the frequency of putative hybrids in Brazil. We detected high intraspecific gene flow among populations collected in the same country. However, there is a geographic limit to gene flow among H. zea individuals from South and North America. Pairwise F-st and private alleles showed that H. armigera is more similar to H. zea from Brazil than H. zea from the United States. A comparative STRUCTURE analysis suggests natural hybridization between H. armigera and H. zea in Brazil. High gene flow and natural hybridization are key traits to population adaptation in new and disturbed environments, which can influence the management of these pests in the American continent.

Differences in leafminer (Phyllonorycter, Gracillariidae, Lepidoptera) and aphid (Tuberculatus, Aphididae, Hemiptera) composition among Quercus dentata, Q. crispula, Q. serrata, and their hybrids	JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH			English	Article						Host specificity; Hybridization; Leaf morphology; Oak	2 OAK QUERCUS; CHLOROPLAST DNA; TREE VARIATION; HYBRIDIZATION; FAGACEAE; DIFFERENTIATION; COMPLEX; HYMENOPTERA; HERBIVORY; ZONES	Leafminer (Phyllonorycter, Gracillariidae, Lepidoptera) and aphid (Tuberculatus, Aphididae, Hemiptera) composition were studied in three deciduous oak species, Quercus dentata, Q. crispula, and Q. serrata, and their hybrids in Tomakomai Experimental Forest of Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, northern Japan. Identification of trees in this forest was done mainly on the basis of discriminant analysis on leaf morphology with reference to trees in pure Q. dentata and Q. crispula stands and a Q. serrata stand mixed with Q. crispula. The results suggested that hybridization occurred in all combinations (i.e. Q. dentata-Q. crispula, Q. crispula-Q. serrata, and Q. serrata-Q. dentata) and the frequency of hybrids was approximately 10%. The composition of Phyllonorycter and Tuberculatus species differed between Q. dentata and Q. crispula or Q. serrata, but did not differ between Q. crispula and Q. serrata. Thus, Q. dentata could differ from Q. crispula and Q. serrata in chemical properties that determine herbivore host selection, survival, and performance, possibly reflecting eco-physiological differences or phylogenetic distances. The study insects were divided into three groups: species specialized to Q. dentata (three Phyllonorycter and one Tuberculatus species), those to Q. crispula and Q. serrata (six Phyllonorycter and two Tuberculatus species), and a species collected at least from Q. dentata and Q. crispula (one Tuberculatus species). Putative hybrid trees of Q. dentata and Q. crispula harbored both Q. dentata-specific and Q. crispula-specific insects.

It is spread all over Corsica in scattered populations linked to diverse habitats. A study by enzyme electrophoresis showed that the genetic diversity of the species is of the same order of magnitude as that of Papilio machaon from continental France and Corsica. The differentiation between populations is rather low, which is consistent with the high vagility of the adults. Natural hybridization between P. hospiton and P. machaon is frequent, and laboratory crosses show that the hybrids are not sterile. However, developmental perturbations impair the viability of further hybrid progenies. Although limited introgression between the two species is likely to take place, enzyme electrophoresis and PCR-RFLP analysis of mitochondrial DNA show that their gene pools remain distinct. Genetic assimilation by P. machaon therefore does not seem to be a threat for P. hospiton. (C) 1997 The Linnean Society of London.

DNA was extracted from larvae, bound to nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled L. dispar NPV (LdNPV) DNA probes. The virus incidence determined from DNA hybridization assays was compared with that determined with conventional microscopic examination of larvae for polyhedral inclusion bodies. Among neonates reared from field-collected egg masses, average mortality from LdNPV (15.4%) within 10 d after hatch was not significantly different from the percentage of extracts containing LdNPV DNA (14.8%) found among larvae frozen 5 d after hatch before any mortality occured. Field-collected larvae were split into two groups: half were frozen immediately and probed for LdNPV DNA and the other half were reared on artificial diet. The proportion containing LdNPV DNA closely approximated the proportion that died within 6 d of collection, but the proportion that died within 13 d of collection was underestimated.

Widespread hybridization among native and invasive species of Operophtera moths (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in Europe and North America	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Winter moth; Bruce spanworm; Forest pests; Hybrid zone; Gene flow; Wolbachia	NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENT; PHEROMONE-BAITED TRAPS; WINTER MOTH; WOLBACHIA INFECTION; BRUMATA LEPIDOPTERA; BRUCE SPANWORM; INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION; CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY; ENDOSYMBIONT WOLBACHIA	In North America the invasive winter moth (Operopthera brumata) has caused defoliation in forest and fruit crop systems in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Oregon, and in the northeastern United States (the "Northeast"). In the Northeast, it was previously shown that hybridization is occurring with a native congener, Bruce spanworm (O. bruceata)-a species that has a broad distribution across much of North America. Whether hybridization among winter moth and Bruce spanworm populations has occurred in all of regions where winter moth established is unknown. One factor that might influence hybridization between these two species is the presence of reproductive manipulating endosymbionts, such a Wolbachia. To determine the geographic extent of hybridization among populations of these two species, we classified 1400 field-collected moths from Europe and North America as either being winter moth, Bruce spanworm, or hybrids using 10-12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. We then screened each individual for the presence of Wolbachia by PCR amplification of the wsp gene fragment. For all hybrids, we determined their maternal species-lineage by PCR amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial locus cytochrome oxidase I. We find that winter moth x Bruce spanworm hybrid individuals appear to be present in all regions of North America that winter moth has invaded, and that hybrids are of both winter moth and Bruce spanworm maternal-origins. In addition, we find Wolbachia infected individuals from all species in North America, and that winter moth individuals in North America have a much lower infection rate (11.5%) than individuals in Europe (55.1%).

J	Collins, MM				Collins, MM			Hybridization and speciation in Hyalophora (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Saturniidae): A reappraisal of W.R. Sweadner's classic study of a hybrid zone	ANNALS OF CARNEGIE MUSEUM			English	Review							UNITED-STATES; EVOLUTION; POPULATIONS; DROSOPHILA; VEGETATION; SELECTION; GENETICS; HISTORY; CLINES	The historical significance of W. R. Sweadner's (1937) classic study of natural hybridization in Hyalophora is discussed in terms of contemporary and modern species concepts. Sweadner proposed that Hyalophora ''kasloensis,'' from the Bitterroot Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, represents a natural hybrid population. In this monograph I re-examine his thesis using experimental hybridization and multivariate analysis, with laboratory hybrids serving as standards of reference. The ecology and immature stages of ''kasloensis'' are described. Biogeographical data, morphology of immature stages, morphometric data, and genetic compatibility in crosses with congeners all independently support the thesis that ''kasloensis'' populations are of hybrid origin. Two other newly discovered hybrid Hyalophora populations from the Pacific Northwest are described. Natural hybridization in Hyalophora is discussed in terms of various hybrid zone models. The genus Hyalophora represents a hierarchy of species, lacking effective prezygotic isolation, but exhibiting varying degrees of postzygotic barriers.

Proboscis morphology suggests reduced feeding abilities of hybrid Limenitis butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						feeding mechanisms; fluid uptake; functional morphology; Haldane's rule; hybridization; mouthparts; reproductive isolating mechanisms	HALDANES RULE; HELICONIUS BUTTERFLIES; PAPILIO-GLAUCUS; DRINKING-STRAW; HOX GENES; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; ZONES; STERILITY; PATTERNS	Hybridization provides the opportunity to study speciation processes. Studies of hybridization in butterflies provide evidence for a range of life-history traits that result in reduced fitness of the hybrid offspring, but no previous studies have examined the feeding ability of adult hybrids. Butterfly mouthpart (proboscis) architecture relates to functionality and is an important structure for fitness, because malformed proboscises would hinder feeding and nutrient acquisition. The proboscis architecture of hybrid Limenitis butterflies ('rubidus' form) was compared with parental types to determine whether hybrids might have a proboscis that impedes feeding. Scanning electron microscopy was used to image proboscises, and 12 measurements were recorded from each individual. Linear discriminant and hierarchical clustering analyses indicated that the proboscis architecture of hybrid butterflies groups separately from the parental types. The results also revealed that hybrids have a reduced proboscis compared with the parental types, which could be maladapted for feeding. Sexual dimorphisms for some structures in hybrids suggest that certain genes responsible for proboscis architecture might be sex linked. The reduced proboscis length and width of F1 hybrid females could be one reason why they have not been observed in the wild, providing an example of environmental selection associated with Haldane's rule.

Morning and evening activity, egg production, and Larval development time of H. himera and H. erato in insectaries were recorded; individuals were collected in allopatry and in sympatry from a hybrid zone in which the species overlapped. Studies were performed at ambient conditions within the natural range of H; himera. H. himera was considerably more active than H. erato, flying earlier in the morning and later in the evening, even when both species were collected in sympatry. Similarly, H. himera laid more eggs, and the hatched larvae developed more rapidly The results suggest that physiological constraints are an important selective force that may have been important in speciation and counteracts hybridization in the maintenance of the H. himera/H. erato contact zone. Ecological selection, arising from adaptation to low temperatures, may help explain the competitive exclusion of H. erato by H. himera in the drier, cooler montane habitat favored by the latter species.

Widespread mito-nuclear discordance with evidence for introgressive hybridization and selective sweeps in Lycaeides	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						hybridization; Lycaeides; mitochondrial introgression; selective sweep; Wolbachia	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; MALE-KILLING WOLBACHIA; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES; HYBRID SPECIATION; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; DARWINS FINCHES; PAPILIO-GLAUCUS; MTDNA VARIATION; POPULATIONS	We investigated the extent and potential cause(s) of mitochondrial introgression within the polytypic North American Lycaeides species complex (Lepidoptera). By comparing population genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA (COI and COII) and nuclear DNA (251 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers), we detected substantial mito-nuclear discordance, primarily involving a single mitochondrial haplotype (h01), which is likely due to mitochondrial introgression between differentiated Lycaeides populations and/or species. We detected reduced mitochondrial genetic diversity relative to nuclear genetic diversity in populations where mitochondrial haplotype h01 occurs, suggesting that the spread of this haplotype was facilitated by selection. We found no evidence that haplotype h01 is associated with increased fitness (in terms of survival to eclosion, fresh adult weight, and adult longevity) in a polymorphic Lycaeides melissa population. However, we did find a positive association between mitochondrial haplotype h01 and infection by the endoparasitic bacterium Wolbachia in one out of three lineages tested. Linkage disequilibrium between mitochondrial haplotype h01 and Wolbachia infection status may have resulted in indirect selection favouring the spread of haplotype h01 in at least one lineage of North American Lycaeides. These results illustrate the potential for introgressive hybridization to produce substantial mito-nuclear discordance and demonstrate that an individual's mitochondrial and nuclear genome may have strikingly different evolutionary histories resulting from non-neutral processes and intrinsic differences in the inheritance and biology of these genomes.

Secondary contact between Lycaeides idas and L-melissa in the Rocky Mountains: extensive admixture and a patchy hybrid zone	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Review						admixture; hybrid zone; Lepidoptera; reproductive isolation; speciation	FIRE-BELLIED TOADS; BUTTERFLY GENUS LYCAEIDES; BOMBINA-BOMBINA; INTROGRESSIVE HYBRIDIZATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; CHROMOSOMAL CLINE; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; SEXUAL SELECTION	Studies of hybridization have increased our understanding of the nature of species boundaries, the process of speciation, and the effects of hybridization on the evolution of populations and species. In the present study we use genetic and morphological data to determine the outcome and consequences of secondary contact and hybridization between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa in the Rocky Mountains. Admixture proportions estimated from structure and geographical cline analysis indicate L. idas and L. melissa have hybridized extensively in the Rocky Mountains and that reproductive isolation was insufficient to prevent introgression for much of the genome. Geographical patterns of admixture suggest that hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa has led to the formation of a hybrid zone. The hybrid zone is relatively wide, given estimates of dispersal for Lycaeides butterflies, and does not show strong evidence of cline concordance among characters. We believe the structure of the Lycaeides hybrid zone might be best explained by the patchy distribution of Lycaeides, local extinction and colonization of habitat patches, environmental variation and weak overall selection against hybrids. We found no evidence that hybridization in the Rocky Mountains has resulted in the formation of independent hybrid species, in contrast to the outcome of hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa in the Sierra Nevada. Finally, our results suggest that differences in male morphology between L. idas and L. melissa might contribute to isolation, or perhaps even that selection has favoured the spread of L. melissa male genitalia alleles.

In this study, a subtractive cDNA library was constructed to screen for immune response-related genes in the fat bodies of Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) pupa challenged with Escherichia coli. Four hundred putative EST clones were identified by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), including 50 immune response-related genes, three cytoskeleton genes, eight cell cycle and apoptosis genes, five respiration and energy metabolism genes, five transport genes, 40 metabolism genes, ten stress response genes, four transcription and translation regulation genes and 77 unknown genes. To verify the reliability of the SSH data, the transcription of a set of randomly selected immune response-related genes were confirmed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). These identified immune response-related genes provide insight into understanding the innate immunity in A. pernyi. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While tannins are often produced as complex, dynamic mixtures, the ecological effects of biological and ontogenetic variation in tannin metabolism within hybrid zones are poorly understood. Here, we examine correlations between the seasonal variation of absolute and relative concentrations of individual ellagitannins and total proanthocyanidins in the Quercus gambelii x Q. grisea hybrid complex and a community of leaf-mining Lepidoptera (Gracillariidae, Heliozelidae, Nepticulidae, Tischeriidae), and examine the interactive effects between tannins on leaf-miner abundance. We found strong seasonal variation in oak tannin phenotypes, but two general phenotypes are characteristic of oaks of the Q. gambelii x Q. grisea complex, based upon biosynthetic variation in high molecular weight ellagitannins. Leaf-miner community structure was significantly correlated with the dominant tannin phenotypes in the Q. gambelii x Q. grisea hybrid zone in mid-summer (July, August). Additionally, leaf-miner density was significantly negatively correlated with the ratio of vescalagin-derivatives and total proanthocyanidins in August and September. Overall, hybridization affects biological and ontogenetic variation in ellagitannin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis within the Q. gambelii x Q. grisea hybrid complex and this variation correlates with herbivore distribution and abundance. Future studies of phenolic chemistry in plant-herbivore interactions in hybrid zones should include a more rigorous quantification of tannin phenotypes as complex, temporally dynamic mixtures.

These two species utilize the same sex attractant and pheromone traps capture both species. We estimated spread based on the ratio of the two species captured in pheromone-baited traps. Population boundaries were derived from captures in a grid of traps and spread was estimated as 6.6 km/year based on displacement of population boundaries between 2005 and 2008. Radial spread rate was also estimated as 6.9 km/year from the displacement of boundaries using logistic regression of trap captures along a single east-west transect of traps deployed yearly from 2007 to 2011. We also estimated the rate of spread from the expansion of defoliation mapped during aerial surveys. Based on the displacement of defoliation boundaries from 2005 to 2008, spread rate was estimated as 6.0 km/year. Based on the year of first defoliation, spread was estimated as 4.8 km/year and regression of the square-root of the cumulative area/pi versus time yielded an estimate of 4.7 km/year. All five estimates were similar, and differences reflect the nuances of the data from which they were derived. We discuss here how the occasional hybridization with O. bruceata may be either retarding or enhancing O. brumata spread.

One interesting butterfly complex species is the Enantia jethys complex that has been studied for over a century; many debates exist regarding the species composition of this complex. Currently, three species that live sympatrically in the Gulf slope of Mexico (Enantia jethys, E. mazai, and E. albania) are recognized in this complex (based on morphological and molecular studies). Where these species live in sympatry, some cases of interspecific mating have been observed, suggesting hybridization events. Considering this, we employed a multilocus approach (analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear sequences: COI, RpS5, and Wg; and nuclear dominant markers: inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSRs) to study hybridization in sympatric populations from Vera-cruz, Mexico. Genetic diversity parameters were determined for all molecular markers, and species identification was assessed by different methods such as analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), clustering, principal coordinate analysis (PC(O)A), gene flow, and PhiPT parameters. ISSR molecular markers were used for a more profound study of hybridization process. Although species of the Enantia jethys complex have a low dispersal capacity, we observed high genetic diversity, probably reflecting a high density of individuals locally. ISSR markers provided evidence of a contemporary hybridization process, detecting a high number of hybrids (from 17% to 53%) with significant differences in genetic diversity. Furthermore, a directional pattern of hybridization was observed from E. albania to other species. Phylogenetic study through DNA sequencing confirmed the existence of three clades corresponding to the three species previously recognized by morphological and molecular studies. This study underlines the importance of assessing hybridization in evolutionary studies, by tracing the lineage separation process that leads to the origin of new species. Our research demonstrates that hybridization processes have a high occurrence in natural populations.

Here we provide evidence for disruptive sexual selection against hybrids between Heliconius cydno and Heliconius melpomene. The two species are sympatric across most of Central and Andean South America, and coexist despite a low level of hybridization. No-choice mating experiments show strong assortative mating between the species. Hybrids mate readily with one another, but both sexes show a reduction in mating success of over 50% with the parental species. Mating preference is associated with a shift in the adult colour pattern, which is involved in predator defence through Mullerian mimicry, but also strongly affects male courtship probability. The hybrids, which lie outside the curve of protection afforded by mimetic resemblance to the parental species, are also largely outside the curves of parental mating preference. Disruptive sexual selection against F-1 hybrids therefore forms an additional post-mating barrier to gene flow, blurring the distinction between pre-mating and post-mating isolation, and helping to maintain the distinctness of these hybridizing species.

One race is bivoltine, with females producing and males responding to a 99:1 E/Z isomeric ratio of DELTA-11-14:OAc's as the sex pheromone. Two races, one univoltine and one bivoltine, produce and respond to a 3:97 E/Z blend of DELTA-11-14:OAc's. The races are referred to as BE, UZ, and BZ to denote these differences. Analyses by gas chromatography of field-collected females indicate that there is significant hybridization between the Z and E races when in sympatry, with hybrid females producing a 68:32 ratio of E/Z11-14:OAc. Gene flow among the races was investigated using differences in triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) allozyme frequencies of moths from sites sampled across the state. The fixed nature of the Tpi-1 allele in the BE race and increases in the Tpi-1 allele frequencies in UZ populations in sympatry with the BE race support the hypothesis that gene flow following hybridization is unidirectional from BE populations into the Z populations. In addition, the TPI genotypes of the 10 hybrid females analyzed were consistent with hybridization occurring by E males mating with Z females.

Transgressive phenotypes might negatively or positively affect hybrid fitness, and increase available variation. Closely related species of Heliconius butterflies regularly produce hybrids in nature, and hybridization is thought to play a role in the diversification of novel wing colour patterns despite strong stabilizing selection due to interspecific mimicry. Here, we studied wing phenotypes in first- and second-generation hybrids produced by controlled crosses between either two co-mimetic species of Heliconius or between two nonmimetic species. We quantified wing size, shape and colour pattern variation and asked whether hybrids displayed transgressive wing phenotypes. Discrete traits underlain by major-effect loci, such as the presence or absence of colour patches, generate novel phenotypes. For quantitative traits, such as wing shape or subtle colour pattern characters, hybrids only exceed the parental range in specific dimensions of the morphological space. Overall, our study addresses some of the challenges in defining and measuring phenotypic transgression for multivariate traits and our data suggest that the extent to which transgressive trait variation in hybrids contributes to phenotypic diversity depends on the complexity and the genetic architecture of the traits.

J	Mallet, J; Beltran, M; Neukirchen, W; Linares, M				Mallet, James; Beltran, Margarita; Neukirchen, Walter; Linares, Mauricio			Natural hybridization in heliconiine butterflies: the species boundary as a continuum	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Review							MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; GENE FLOW; HYBRID ZONES; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; WARNING COLOR; LINKAGE MAP; HOST RACES; SPECIATION; MIMICRY	Background: To understand speciation and the maintenance of taxa as separate entities, we need information about natural hybridization and gene flow among species. Results: Interspecific hybrids occur regularly in Heliconius and Eueides (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in the wild: 26-29% of the species of Heliconiina are involved, depending on species concept employed. Hybridization is, however, rare on a per-individual basis. For one well-studied case of species hybridizing in parapatric contact (Heliconius erato and H. himera), phenotypically detectable hybrids form around 10% of the population, but for species in sympatry hybrids usually form less than 0.05% of individuals. There is a roughly exponential decline with genetic distance in the numbers of natural hybrids in collections, both between and within species, suggesting a simple "exponential failure law" of compatibility as found in some prokaryotes. Conclusion: Hybridization between species of Heliconius appears to be a natural phenomenon; there is no evidence that it has been enhanced by recent human habitat disturbance. In some well-studied cases, backcrossing occurs in the field and fertile backcrosses have been verified in insectaries, which indicates that introgression is likely, and recent molecular work shows that alleles at some but not all loci are exchanged between pairs of sympatric, hybridizing species. Molecular clock dating suggests that gene exchange may continue for more than 3 million years after speciation. In addition, one species, H. heurippa, appears to have formed as a result of hybrid speciation. Introgression may often contribute to adaptive evolution as well as sometimes to speciation itself, via hybrid speciation. Geographic races and species that coexist in sympatry therefore form part of a continuum in terms of hybridization rates or probability of gene flow. This finding concurs with the view that processes leading to speciation are continuous, rather than sudden, and that they are the same as those operating within species, rather than requiring special punctuated effects or complete allopatry. Although not qualitatively distinct from geographic races, nor "real" in terms of phylogenetic species concepts or the biological species concept, hybridizing species of Heliconius are stably distinct in sympatry, and remain useful groups for predicting morphological, ecological, behavioural and genetic characteristics.

This form arises from rare mixed matings between L. archippus (Cr.) x L. arthemis astyanax (Fabr.), two closely related species which are involved in two quite differently colored mimicry complexes. The hybrids often occur when one or both of the parental species is or are rare. The New Mexican specimen involves the two southwestern desert subspecies of the parental butterflies. These two state records bring to 51 the known occurrences of these natural hybrids, all of which are males. This hybrid form has been reported from 20 states and the District of Columbia. Most of the hybrid records occur late in the flight season, except in Florida. Phenotypically and behaviorally this form represents a complete breakdown of the different mimetic resemblances present in its two parental species, thus placing this insect at a considerable selective disadvantage in natural populations.

The case of Heliconius erato and H-himera (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						parapatry; Passiflora; refugium biogeography; hybridization	FIRE-BELLIED TOADS; WARNING-COLOR; BOMBINA-BOMBINA; GENE FLOW; BUTTERFLIES; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; MITOCHONDRIAL; HYBRIDIZATION; CONVERGENCE	To understand speciation we need to study the genetics and ecology of intermediate cases where interspecific hybridization still occurs. Two closely related species of Heliconius butterflies meet this criterion: Heliconius himera is endemic to dry forest and thorn scrub in southern Ecuador and northern Peru, while its sister species, H. erato, is ubiquitous in wet forest throughout south and central America. In three known zones of contact, the two species remain distinct, while hybrids are found at low frequency. Collections in southern Ecuador show that the contact zone is about 5 km wide, half the width of the narrowest dines between colour pattern races of H. erato. The narrowness of this dine argues that very strong selection (s approximate to 1) is maintaining the parapatric distributions of these two species. The zone is closely related with a habitat transition from wet to dry forest, which suggests that the narrow zone of parapatry is maintained primarily by ecological adaptation. Selection on colour pattern loci, assortative mating and hybrid inviability may also be important. The genetics of hybrids between the two species shows that the major gene control of pattern elements is similar to that found in previous studies of H. erato races, and some of the loci are homologous. This suggests that similar generic processes are involved in the morphological divergence of species and races. Evidence from related Heliconius supports a hypothesis that ecological adaptation is the driving force for speciation in the group.

J	Lukhtanov, VA				Lukhtanov, Vladimir A.			A new species of Melitaea from Israel, with notes on taxonomy, cytogenetics, phylogeography and interspecific hybridization in the Melitaea persea complex (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae)	COMPARATIVE CYTOGENETICS			English	Article						Chromosomes; COI; DNA barcoding; genitalia; homoploid hybrid speciation; interspecific hybridization; Middle East; Melitaea casta; Melitaea eberti; Melitaea higginsi; Melitaea deserticola; Melitaea trivia; morphology; nomenclature; taxonomy	HOMOPLOID HYBRID SPECIATION; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; BUTTERFLIES LEPIDOPTERA; TRIBE MELITAEINI; DNA BARCODES; EVOLUTION; LYCAENIDAE; CHROMOSOME; INSIGHTS; POSITION	Specimens with intermediate morphology are often considered to be the result of ongoing interspecific hybridization; however, this conclusion is difficult to prove without analysis of chromosomal and/or molecular markers. In the butterfly genus Melitaea, such an intermediacy can be detected in male genitalia, and is more or less regularly observed in localities where two closely related, presumably parental species are found in sympatry. Here I analyze a high altitude Melitaea population from Mt. Hermon in north Israel and show that its male genitalia are clearly differentiated from those found in phenotypically similar M. persea and M. didyma, but in some aspects intermediate between them. This hybrid-like population is unique because, although M. didyma is present on Mt. Hermon, the true, low-altitude M. persea has never been reported from Israel. Cytogenetic analysis revealed no apomorphic chromosomal characters to distinguish the Mt. Hermon population from other known taxa of the M. persea and M. didyma species groups. At the same time, DNA barcode-based phylogeographic study showed that this population is ancient. It was estimated to originate 1-1.6 million years ago in the Levantine refugium from a common ancestor with M. persea. Generally, the data obtained are incompatible with interpretation of the studied population as a taxon conspecific with M. persea or M. didyma, or a swarm of recent hybrids between M. persea and M. didyma, although the possibility of ancient homoploid hybrid speciation cannot be ruled out. I also argue that the name Melitaea montium assigned to butterflies from north Lebanon cannot be applied to the studied taxon from Mt. Hermon. Here I describe this morphologically and ecologically distinct entity as a new species Melitaea acentria sp. n., and compare it with other taxa of the M. persea complex.

To assess the possible risks from their habitats overlapping, we investigated the potential for hybridization and the development of F1 individuals. We observed successful mating of the two sibling species under artificial conditions. The presence of a postzygotic hybridization barrier was supported by the delay of larval development only in females; a delay did not occur in males. Existence of the barrier was also supported by a decreased egg hatching rate in one brood; this was likely associated with infection with Wolbachia, a bacterium manipulating the reproductive capability of its host. The size and wing markings of F1 hybrid individuals were intermediate between those of the two species. These results suggest that, if Z. emelina and Z. otis are distributed sympatrically in the future, there is a possibility of introgression and reproductive interference between the two species, which would increase the risk of decline of each species.

Genomic introgression from a distant congener in the Levant fritillary butterfly, Melitaea acentria	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						hybridization; introgression; lepidoptera; phylogeography; Z chromosome	FASTER-Z EVOLUTION; ADAPTIVE INTROGRESSION; COMPLEX LEPIDOPTERA; REDUCED INTROGRESSION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; SEQUENCE; SPECIATION; CHROMOSOME; TOOL; NYMPHALIDAE	Introgressive hybridization is more common in nature than previously thought, and its role and creative power in evolution is hotly discussed but not completely understood. Introgression occurs more frequently in sympatry between recently diverged taxa, or when the speciation process has not yet been completed. However, there are relatively few documented cases of hybridization that erodes reproductive barriers between distantly related species. Here, we use whole genome and mitochondrial data to examine how introgression from a distant congener affects pattern of genetic differentiation in the Levant fritillary butterfly Melitaea acentria. We show that this local taxon has evolved as a peripatric geographic isolate of the widespread Melitaea persea, and that there has been significant unidirectional gene flow from the sympatric, nonclosely related Melitaea didyma to M. acentria. We found direct evidence of ongoing sporadic hybridization between M. didyma and M. acentria, which are separated by at least 5 million years of independent evolution. Elevated differentiation and lower level of introgression on the sex Z chromosome compared to autosomes suggest that the Z chromosome has accumulated loci acting as intrinsic postzygotic barriers. Our results show that introgression from M. didyma has been an additional source of nucleotide diversity in the M. acentria population, providing material for drift and selection.

This group is composed of four sub-Saharan species: Sesamia poephaga Tams & Bowden; Sesamia epunctifera Hampson; Sesamia penniseti Tams & Bowden; and Sesamia poebora Tams & Bowden, the taxonomic status of which was unclear. The first species was considered a possible synonym of the second, and the third species was considered a possible synonym of the fourth. An analysis combining morphological, ecological and molecular data enables us to conclude that S. epunctifera and S. poephaga are different species, and that S. poebora is a synonym of S. penniseti. Two new species were discovered: Sesamia firmata sp.n. and Sesamia veronica sp.n. Sesamia firmata sp.n. has atypical genitalic morphology, suggesting a strong selection resulting in a reinforcement of pre-zygotic isolation. Some specimens previously identified as S. penniseti on the basis of morphology are sisters to S. epunctifera on the mitochondrial tree, and are connected to S. penniseti on the nuclear tree. The mitochondrial distance from S. penniseti and S. epunctifera is 7.6% and 3.9%, respectively, suggesting an ancient mitochondrial introgression from S. epunctifera into S. penniseti. The possible causes of the reinforcement and introgressive hybridization are discussed. This case of mitochondrial introgression, uncommon in Lepidoptera, in which females are the heterogametic sex, may be an exception to Haldane's rule. The hybrid is assigned the rank of species and named Sesamia pennipuncta sp.n.

J	Tovar-Sanchez, E; Oyama, K				Tovar-Sanchez, E; Oyama, K			Effect of hybridization of the Quercus crassifolia x Quercus crassipes complex on the community structure of endophagous insects	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						hybridization; gall forming; leaf mining; Quercus; community structure	PLANT HYBRID ZONES; GALL WASPS; HERBIVORE COMMUNITY; SECONDARY CHEMISTRY; VARIABLE RESPONSES; MOLECULAR EVIDENCE; OAK; RESISTANCE; WILLOWS; DIVERSITY	In a previous study, we showed that the geographic proximity of hybrid plants to the allopatric areas of parental species increases their morphological and genetic similarity with them. In the present work, we explored whether the endophagous fauna of hybrid plants show the same pattern. We studied the canopy species richness, diversity and composition of leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera: Tischeridae, Citheraniidae) and gall-forming wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) associated with two species of red oaks (Quercus crassifolia and Quercus crassipes) and their interspecific hybrid (Quercusxdysophylla Benth pro sp.) in seven hybrid zones in central Mexico, during four seasons in 2 years. The study was conducted on 194 oak trees with known genetic status [identified by leaf morphology and molecular markers (random amplified polymorphic DNAs)], and the results indicate a bidirectional pattern of gene flow. Hybrid plants supported intermediate levels of infestation of gall-forming and leaf-mining insects compared to their putative parental species. The infestation level of leaf-mining insects varied significantly following the pattern: Q. crassifolia > hybrids > Q. crassipes, whereas the gall-forming insects showed an inverse pattern. A negative and significant relationship was found between these two types of insect guilds in each host taxa, when the infestation percentage was evaluated. It was found that 31.5% (n=11) of the endophagous insects were specific to Q. crassipes, 22.9% (n=8) to Q. crassifolia, and 8.6% (n=3) to hybrid individuals. The hybrid bridge hypothesis was supported in the case of 25.7% (n=9) of insects, which suggests that the presence of a hybrid intermediary plant may favor a host herbivore shift from one plant species to another. Greater genetic diversity in a hybrid zone is associated with greater diversity in the endophagous community. The geographic proximity of hybrid plants to the allopatric site of a parental species increases their similarity in terms of endophagous insects and the Eje Neovolcanico acts as a corridor favoring this pattern.

Although the vast majority of species has a WZ/ZZ (female/male) sex chromosome system, it is generally accepted that the ancestral system was Z/ZZ and the W chromosome has evolved in a common ancestor of Tischeriidae and Ditrysia. However, the lack of data on sex chromosomes in lower Lepidoptera has prevented a formal test of this hypothesis. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of sex chromosomes in Tischeria ekebladella (Tischeriidae) and 3 species representing lower Ditrysia, Cameraria ohridella (Gracillariidae), Plutella xylostella (Plutellidae), and Tineola bisselliella (Tineidae). Using comparative genomic hybridization we show that the first 3 species have well-differentiated W chromosomes, which vary considerably in their molecular composition, whereas T. bisselliella has no W chromosome. Furthermore, our results suggest the presence of neo-sex chromosomes in C. ohridella. For Z chromosomes, we selected 5 genes evenly distributed along the Z chromosome in ditrysian model species and tested their Z-linkage using qPCR. The tested genes (Henna, laminin A, Paramyosin, Tyrosine hydroxylase, and 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) proved to be Z-linked in all species examined. The conserved synteny of the Z chromosome across Tischeriidae and Ditrysia, along with the W chromosome absence in the lower ditrysian families Psychidae and Tineidae, suggests a possible independent origin of the W chromosomes in these 2 lineages.

Here, we focused on two Lepidoptera sister species that come in contact near the Turkish Straits System (TSS). We aimed to infer their phylogeographic histories in the Eastern Mediterranean and finely analyze their co-occurrence and hybridization patterns in this biogeographic context. We used molecular mitochondrial and nuclear markers to study 224 individuals from 42 localities. We used discordances between markers and complementary assignment methods to identify and map hybrids and parental individuals. We confirmed the parapatric distribution of Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae) in the west and Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni in the east and identified a narrow contact zone. We identified several glacial refugia of T. wilkinsoni in southern Turkey with a strong east-west differentiation in this species. Unexpectedly, T. pityocampa crossed the TSS and occur in northern Aegean Turkey and some eastern Greek islands. We found robust evidence of introgression between the two species in a restricted zone in northwestern Turkey, but we did not identify any F-1 individuals. The identified hybrid zone was mostly bimodal. The distributions and genetic patterns of the studied species were strongly influenced both by the Quaternary climatic oscillations and the complex geological history of the Aegean region. T. pityocampa and T. wilkinsoni survived the last glacial maximum in disjoint refugia and met in western Turkey at the edge of the recolonization routes. Expanding population of T. wilkinsoni constrained T. pityocampa to the western Turkish shore. Additionally, we found evidence of recurrent introgression by T. wilkinsoni males in several T. pityocampa populations. Our results suggest that some prezygotic isolation mechanisms, such as differences in timing of the adult emergences, might be a driver of the isolation between the sister species.

No progeny were obtained by crossing females of A. segetum with males of A. ipsilon. Backcrosses were successful only by crossing hybrids with both sexes of A. ipsilon. No larval oligopause occurred when hybrid larvae were reared under conditions inducing arrest in A. segetum (12L:12D, 21 degrees C). Wind tunnel tests showed interattractiveness of F-1 hybrids with A. ipsilon but not with A. segetum. Single sensillum recordings of pheromone-sensitive hairs on the antennae of males of the parent species revealed differences in the distribution of sensilla. F-1 and F-2 hybrids exhibited the same receptor cell types and distribution as A, ipsilon. Gas chromatographic analysis of female pheromone gland extracts revealed that F-1 hybrids were also very close to A. ipsilon.

Although dominance theory (Turelli and Orr 1995) has been proposed as a general explanation of Haldane's rule, this remains to be tested in female-heterogametic taxa, such as the Lepidoptera. Here we describe a novel example of Haldane's rule in Heliconius melpomene (Lepidoptera; Nymphalidae). Female F-1 offspring are sterile when a male from French Guiana is crossed to a female from Panama, but fertile in the reciprocal cross. Male F(1)s are fertile in both directions. Similar female F-1 sterility occurs in crosses between French Guiana and eastern Colombian populations, Backcrosses and linkage analysis show that sterility results from an interaction between gene(s) on the Z chromosome of the Guiana race with autosomal factors in the Panama genome. Large X (or Z) effects are commonly observed in Drosophila, but to our knowledge have not been previously demonstrated for hybrid sterility in Lepidoptera. Differences in the abundance of male versus female or Z-linked versus autosomal sterility factors cannot be ruled out in our crosses as causes of Haldane's rule. Nonetheless, the demonstration that recessive Z-linked loci cause hybrid sterility in a female heterogametic species supports the contention that dominance theory provides a general explanation of Haldane's rule (Turelli and Orr 2000).

No genomic mosaicism in a putative hybrid butterfly species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						amplified fragment length polymorphism; Heliconius; introgressive hybridization; hybrid speciation; Lepidoptera	HELICONIUS BUTTERFLIES; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; POPULATION; HYBRIDIZATION; LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIATION; INFERENCE; ORIGIN; INTROGRESSION; SEQUENCES	Recent descriptions of hybrid animal species have spurred interest in this phenomenon, but little genomic data exist to support it. Here, we use frequency variation for 657 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and DNA sequence variation from 16 genes to determine whether the genome of Heliconius pachinus, a suspected hybrid butterfly species, is a mixture of the putative parental species, Heliconius cydno and Heliconius melpomene. Despite substantial shared genetic variation among all three species, we show that the genome of H. pachinus is not a mosaic; both AFLP and DNA sequence data overwhelmingly associate H. pachinus with just one of the potential parents, H. cydno. This pattern also applies to the gene wingless, which is tightly linked to the locus that determines forewing colour-one specific H. pachinus trait that has been hypothesized to have originated from H. melpomene. As a whole, the data support a traditional, bifurcating model of speciation in which H. pachinus split from a common ancestor with H. cydno without a genetic contribution from H. melpomene. However, comparison of our data to DNA sequence data for another putative hybrid Heliconius species, Heliconius heurippa, suggests that the H. heurippa genome may be a mosaic.

We studied premating barriers between the warningly colored butterflies Heliconius erato and H. himera (Lepidoptera) in a narrow contact zone in Ecuador, where hybrids are found at low frequency. Eggs obtained from wild-mated females, supplemented with eggs and young larvae collected from the wild, were reared to adulthood. Adult color patterns of these progeny were then used to infer how their parents must have mated. Likelihood was used to estimate both the frequencies of potential parental genotypes from adult phenotypes collected in the wild, and the degree of assortative mating from the inferred parents. The frequencies of parental genotypes varied across the hybrid zone, but our statistical method allowed estimates of hybrid deficit and assortative mating to be integrated across all sites sampled. The best estimate of the frequency of F(1) and backcross hybrid adults in the center of the hybrid zone was 10%, with support limits (7.1%, 13.0%; support limits are asymptotically equivalent to 95% confidence limits). Mating was highly assortative: in the center of the hybrid zone the cross-mating probability between H. erato and H. himera was only 5% (0.3%, 21.4%). Wild hybrids themselves mated with both pure forms, and the probabilities that they mated in any direction were not significantly lower than those among conspecifics. These results are consistent with earlier laboratory studies on mate choice, and suggest that selection against hybrids must be strong to prevent formation of a hybrid swarm. Unfortunately, the wide support limits on mating behavior precluded a measure of the strength of selection from these data alone. Our statistical approach provides a useful general method for estimating mate choice in the wild.

Hybrids can, however, also deceive morphology-based taxonomy, resulting in the description of invalid species based on hybrid specimens. As the result of an unexpected case of discordance between barcoding results and current morphology-based taxonomy, we discovered an example of such a hybrid 'species' in hawkmoths. By combining barcodes, morphology and a nuclear marker, we show that Gnathothlibus collardi Haxaire, 2002 is actually an F1 hybrid between two closely related species that co-occur on Tahiti. In accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the taxon G. collardi is thus invalid as a species. This study demonstrates the potential of DNA barcodes to detect overlooked hybrid taxa. With the growth of sequence libraries, we anticipate that more unsuspected hybrid species will be detected, particularly among those taxa that are very rare, such as those known from only the type specimen.

E. Smith), use different graminaceous host plants, coexist sympatrically throughout their ranges, yet seem to hybridize. To address the taxonomic status of the two forms, determine extent and directionality of hybridization, and examine host specificity, we compiled multilocus genotypes consisting of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes, an esterase locus, and eight amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) loci in moths collected across a broad geographic range. Multilocus analyses indicated 16% of individuals sampled were potentially hybrids with a minority being F, in origin. Analysis of host use indicated asymmetries in host specificity with one strain specific to corn, Zea mays L., and the other strain predominating on pasture grasses and rice, but occasionally using corn. Location of hybrids in nature was biased toward cornfields, the habitat used by both strains. To assess genetic divergence of each gene, we calculated their relative strain discriminating ability. Eight AFLP loci collectively had the greatest discriminating power (98%), followed by a single AFLP locus (93%) and mtDNA (91%). Esterase exhibited 89% discrimination. Esterase is X-linked along with an assortative mating trait, suggesting esterase differentiation may be maintained by association with strain-specific fitness genes. Despite strong discrimination of these genes, most of the genome surveyed was not distinct. Cytonuclear comparisons provided evidence for unidirectional matings consistent with mate preference studies. Collectively, these data support introgressive hybridization between recently evolved species that are not completely reproductively isolated. Genetic divergence in the presence of gene flow may be a common phase in the speciation process, especially in taxa whose ranges have been altered dramatically by humans.

Two contact zones are known near the town of Tarapoto: Ahuashiyacu, where both subspecies cohabit but do not seem to hybridise, and Estero ( near the village of Shapaja), where they apparently hybridise. Genetic differences between the two subspecies and between populations were investigated with random amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) markers. Both Cluster and Principal Coordinates Analyses (CCoA and PCoA) performed using these data, provided a clear but weak discrimination between the two subspecies. Genetic diversity is much higher within the populations than between them. Moreover, the geographically more distant populations are grouped together by the genetic data. Morphological traits on the wing patterns of the hybrids are intermediary between the two butterflies subspecies, while RAPDs data place them closer to O. onega agarista than to O. onega ssp. The individuals of the Ahuashiyacu population are clearly separated into two groups, those of O. onega ssp. and O. onega agarista, by both morphology and RAPDs data. Moreover, none of those individuals show RAPD similarity with the hybrids, suggesting that hybridisation has not occurred in this population.

Alternative facts: a reconsideration of putatively natural interspecific hybrid specimens in the genus Heliconius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						hybridization; introgression; gene flow; species boundary; hybrid speciation	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA SEQUENCES; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; MATE PREFERENCE; COSTA-RICA; BUTTERFLIES; MIMICRY; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; INTROGRESSION	Mallet et al. (2007 BMC Evolutionary Biology, 7, 28) employed a database of putative interspecific hybrid specimens of the genus Heliconius to advance a hypothesis of "the species boundary as a continuum." Here, each of those specimens, as well as subsequently documented specimens, is individually reassessed regarding its phenotype, potential parentage and chain of custody in collections. Using a quantified scale of reliability, most of the specimens are interpreted differently than Mallet et al.'s identifications, and the actual number of interspecific hybrids is estimated to be much smaller than they proposed. To be specific, of 163 putative hybrid specimens examined, 11% suffered from ambiguous identity, 5% from confounding issues with their data labels, 50% were arguably intraspecific (depending upon alternative species concepts), and 22% were almost certainly reared, commercial specimens. Only eleven of the specimens meet the criteria established here to be legitimate and reliable interspecific hybrids, and all of those are between closely-related species. This result has potentially important implications for current hypotheses of frequent genomic introgression of wing pattern alleles among Heliconius clades.	[Brower, Andrew V.

In contrast, pupation date, an indicator of development time, was intermediate in the hybrids relative to the parental colonies. There was also a 37% increase in the numbers of eggs/female and a 45% increase in egg masses/female in the hybrid parental cross. We investigated this stimulation of oviposition in single female, reciprocal crosses. Oviposition stimulation was directional with the cross of N colony males x O colony females exhibiting significantly higher numbers of total eggs/female and egg masses/female on a daily basis. Colony O females in this cross laid more large egg masses than females in other crosses. Data from individual female crosses demonstrated that egg production in hybrid mass mating experiments was consistent with random mating of males and females from both colonies.

Patterns of genitalic morphology around suture zones in North American Lycaeides (Lepidoptera : Lycaenidae): Implications for taxonomy and historical biogeography	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						Remington suture zones; hybridization; Lycaeides; morphology; Nabokov	BUTTERFLY GENUS LYCAEIDES; DIVERSIFICATION; SPECIATION	Within the North American Lycaeides (Hubner) fauna, there are at least three major lineages that exhibit extensive morphological and ecological variation, especially at suture zones where these lineages meet. We examined male genitalic morphology in Lycaeides populations spanning much of North America to evaluate the current taxonomy and to address questions about the patterns of morphological variation at suture zones and potential evolutionary processes responsible for the patterns. Our genitalic measurements were based on those of V. Nabokov who revised North American Lycaeides taxonomy in the 1940s. Canonical discriminant analysis validated Nabokov's original species designations, but it did not support many of his subspecific designations. Populations at a suture zone in the Great Lakes region are similar to populations on the east side of this zone. Populations at a western suture zone in the Sierra Nevada and adjacent ranges exhibit intermediate morphology between lineages on either side of this suture zone. We tested the hypothesis that contemporary gene flow contributes to the patterns of morphology in suture zones by testing for the increased variance in quantitative traits that is expected in a hybrid swarm. Based on a comparison of variances from populations within and outside of these suture zones, there is no evidence of current hybridization between lineages, with the sole exception of the population sample from the White Mountains of eastern California. The intermediate morphology and the general absence of increased variance within western suture zone populations imply that hybridization may have been important in the evolution of North American Lycaeides.

Corn hybrids produced from resistant germplasm were evaluated together with Bt and nonBt commercial hybrids in field tests and laboratory bioassays for resistance to leaf and ear damage by southwestern corn borer, fall armyworm, and corn earworm. The Bt hybrids, Mp496 x Mp716 and Mp704 x Mp716, exhibited resistance to leaf feeding damage by southwestern corn borer and fall armyworm. The Bt hybrids sustained significantly less southwestern corn borer ear damage than their nonBt versions. Those genotypes expressing resistance to leaf feeding also showed resistance, as indicated by reduced larval growth or survival in laboratory bioassays based on lyophilized leaf tissue, to southwestern corn borer, fall armyworm, and corn earworm. Only the Bt hybrids expressed resistance when larval growth was evaluated in bioassays based on lyophilized husk tissues. Using both field tests and laboratory bioassays to assess resistance to these insects will enhance efforts to identify useful germplasm and determine factors contributing to resistance.

The appeal of such approaches is undeniable since they will clearly be an asset in rapid biological assessments of poorly known taxa or unexplored areas, and for discovery of cryptic biodiversity. However, as an approach for diagnosing units for conservation, some caution is warranted. The essential issue is that mitochondrial DNA variation is unlikely to be causally related to, and thus correlated with, ecologically important components of fitness. This is true for DNA barcoding, molecular taxonomy in general, or any technique that relies on variation at a single, presumed neutral locus. Given that natural selection operates on a time scale that is often much more rapid than the rates of mutation and allele frequency changes due to genetic drift, neutral genetic variation at a single locus can be a poor predictor of adaptive variation within or among species. Furthermore, reticulate processes, such as introgressive hybridization, may also constrain the utility of molecular taxonomy to accurately detect significant units for conservation. A survey of published genetic data from the Lepidoptera indicates that these problems may be more prevalent than previously suspected. Molecular approaches must be used with caution for conservation genetics which is best accomplished using large sample sizes over extensive geography in addition to data from multiple loci.

Here, we propose a simple but effective strategy to tackle this issue: pooling DNA from a number of selected representative species of different clades to prepare PCR-generated baits to minimize the genetic distance between the bait and target. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we newly developed a set of universal nuclear markers (including 94 nuclear protein-coding genes) for Lepidoptera, a superdiverse insect group. We used a DNA pool from six lepidopteran species (representing six superfamilies) to prepare PCR baits for the 94 markers. These homemade PCR baits were used to capture sequence data from 43 species of 17 lepidopteran families, and 94% of the target loci were recovered. We constructed two data sets from the obtained data (one containing 90 kb target coding sequences and the other containing 120 kb target + flanking coding sequences). Both data sets yielded highly similar and well-resolved trees with 90% of nodes having >95% bootstrap support. Our capture experiment indicated that using DNA mixtures pooled from different clade-representative species of Lepidoptera to prepare PCR baits can reliably capture a large number of targeted nuclear markers across different Lepidoptera lineages. We hope that this newly developed nuclear marker set will serve as a new phylogenetic tool for Lepidoptera phylogenetics, and the PCR bait preparation strategy can facilitate the application of sequence capture techniques by researchers to accelerate data collection.

These compounds, alone and in combination, were applied for studying the Zygaenidae fauna in Italy for four years from 2015 to 2018. We evaluated the effectiveness of the three following variants: EFETOV-2 (the racemic mixture of (2R)-butyl 2-dodecenoate and (2S)-butyl 2-dodecenoate), EFETOV-S-2 (the R-enantiomer alone) and EFETOV-S-S-2 (the S-enantiomer alone). The males of three genera of Procridinae were attracted to the lures from the series "EFETOV-2": Rhagades Wallengren, 1863 (one species), Adscita Retzius, 1783 (six species), and Jordanita Verity, 1946 (four species).

Multilocus analyses of admixture and introgression among hybridizing Heliconius butterflies	EVOLUTION			English	Article						admixture; gene flow; Heliconius; hybridization; introgression; isolation with migration; Lepidoptera	POPULATION-GENETICS; MULLERIAN MIMICRY; NATURAL-SELECTION; PATTERN-FORMATION; RACE FORMATION; EVOLUTION; SPECIATION; MITOCHONDRIAL; DIVERGENCE; LEPIDOPTERA	Introgressive hybridization is an important evolutionary process and new analytical methods provide substantial power to detect and quantify it. In this study we use variation in the frequency of 657 AFLP fragments and DNA sequence variation from 15 genes to measure the extent of admixture and the direction of interspecific gene flow among three Heliconius butterfly species that diverged recently as a result of natural selection for Mullerian mimicry, and which continue to hybridize. Bayesian clustering based on AFLP genotypes correctly delineated the three species and identified four H. cydno, three H. pachinus, and three H. melpomene individuals that were of mixed ancestry. Gene genealogies revealed substantial shared DNA sequence variation among all three species and coalescent simulations based on the Isolation with Migration (IM) model pointed to interspecific gene flow as its cause. The IM simulations further indicated that interspecific gene flow was significantly asymmetrical, with greater gene flow from H. pachinus into H. cydno (2Nm = 4.326) than the reverse (2Nm = 0.502), and unidirectional gene flow from H. cydno and H. pachinus into H. melpomene (2Nm = 0.294 and 0.252, respectively). These asymmetries are in the directions expected based on the genetics of wing patterning and the probability that hybrids of various phenotypes will survive and reproduce in different mimetic environments. This empirical demonstration of extensive interspecific gene flow is in contrast to a previous study which found little evidence of gene flow between another pair of hybridizing Heliconius species, H. himera and H. erato, and it highlights the critical role of natural selection in maintaining species diversity. Furthermore, these results lend support to the hypotheses that phenotypic diversification in the genus Heliconius has been fueled by introgressive hybridization and that reinforcement has driven the evolution of assortative mate preferences.

However, some species, especially plants and animals with holocentric chromosomes, are known to tolerate chromosomal heterozygosity even for multiple rearrangements. Here, we studied male meiotic chromosome behavior in four hybrid generations (F1-F4) between two chromosomal races of the Wood White butterfly Leptidea sinapis differentiated by at least 24 chromosomal fusions/fissions. Previous work showed that these hybrids were fertile, although their fertility was reduced as compared to crosses within chromosomal races. We demonstrate that (i) F1 hybrids are highly heterozygous with nearly all chromosomes participating in the formation of trivalents at the first meiotic division, and (ii) that from F1 to F4 the number of trivalents decreases and the number of bivalents increases. We argue that the observed process of chromosome sorting would, if continued, result in a new homozygous chromosomal race, i.e., in a new karyotype with intermediate chromosome number and, possibly, in a new incipient homoploid hybrid species. We also discuss the segregational model of karyotype evolution and the chromosomal model of homoploid hybrid speciation.

Here we use overall genomic compatibility as an alternative estimate of species relationships in a group where divergence is rapid and genetic exchange is common. Heliconius heurippa, a butterfly species endemic to Colombia, has a colour pattern genetically intermediate between H. cydno and H. melpomene: its hindwing is nearly indistinguishable from that of H. melpomene and its forewing band is an intermediate phenotype between both species. This observation has lead to the suggestion that the pattern of H. heurippa arose through hybridization. We present a genetic analysis of hybrid compatibility in crosses between the three taxa. Heliconius heurippa x H. cydno and female H. melpomene x male H. heurippa yield fertile and viable F-1 hybrids, but male H. melpomene x female H. heurippa crosses yield sterile F-1 females. In contrast, Haldane's rule has previously been detected between H. melpomene and H cydno in both directions. Therefore, H. heurippa is most closely related to H. cydno, with some evidence for introgression of genes from H. melpomene. The results are compatible with the hypothesis of a hybrid origin for H. heurippa. In addition, backcrosses using F-1 hybrid males provide evidence for a large Z(X)-chromosome effect on sterility and for recessive autosomal sterility factors as predicted by Dominance Theory.

However, morphological differences between the taxa are minor and therefore their status has often been disputed. Here, we present a molecular phylognetic study, which separates T. griseata and T comae into different clades. Altogether, 43 Timandra specimens from eight European countries were studied. The phylogeny is based on a comparative sequence analysis of mitochondrial genes coding for the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1). Nevertheless, a single individual of both species was assigned to the "wrong" clade. The symplesiomorphy of T griseata and T comae is considered to be a result of introgressive hybridization. Conditions that could lead to the hybridization of T griseata and T comae are discussed, as well as the likely distribution history of these taxa in Northern Europe. Results of the current analysis are in favour of retaining the species status of T griseata and T. comae.

Seventeen species-specific RAPD markers were used to differentiate between these 2 closely related and morphologically similar budworm species. Several morphologically atypical specimens of each budworm species were selected for analysis based on deviations from conventional descriptions of uncus shape and size, wing bands, maculation, and background coloration. Analysis of the distribution of species-specific markers in selected specimens from Atlantic Canada, where the 2 species are sympatric and their flight periods occasionally overlap, suggests that reproductive isolation of these 2 Choristoneura species is incomplete, thus providing the first evidence that hybridization of C. fumiferana and C pinus has occurred in nature. The significance of these results to hybridization, introgression and retained ancestral polymorphism is discussed.

Limited intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation despite chromosomal rearrangements between closely related sympatric species of small ermine moths (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						chromosome pairing; fecundity; host plant adaptation; host shift; hybrid sterility; Lepidoptera; meiosis; speciation; specialization; Yponomeuta	SEX-CHROMOSOME; SYNAPTONEMAL COMPLEXES; SPECIATION CONTINUUM; GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE; LOCAL ADAPTATION; HOST SHIFTS; GENE FLOW; EVOLUTION; RECOMBINATION; INVERSIONS	In evolutionarily young species and sympatric host races of phytophagous insects, postzygotic incompatibility is often not yet fully developed, but reduced fitness of hybrids is thought to facilitate further divergence. However, empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited. To assess the role of reduced hybrid fitness, we studied meiosis and fertility in hybrids of two closely related small ermine moths, Yponomeuta padella and Yponomeuta cagnagella, and determined the extent of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation. We found extensive rearrangements between the karyotypes of the two species and irregularities in meiotic chromosome pairing in their hybrids. The fertility of reciprocal F-1 and, surprisingly, also of backcrosses with both parental species was not significantly decreased compared with intraspecific offspring. The results indicate that intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation between these closely related species is limited. We conclude that the observed chromosomal rearrangements are probably not the result of an accumulation of postzygotic incompatibilities preventing hybridization. Alternative explanations, such as adaptation to new host plants, are discussed.	[Hora, Katerina H.; Roessingh, Peter; Menken, Steph B.

The rhythmic release of pheromone by H. subflexa, H. virescens and backcross females was correlated with the response rhythm of males. The behavioral courtship sequence of H. subflexa males (P < 0.05) included oriented flight, landing, antennation, attempted copulation, and mating behaviors. Backcross insects did not antennate, but they fully displayed their hairpencils as did males of H. virescens. Factors that increased the probability of successful matings were identified as an acquiescent female, antennating by H. subflexa males, full hairpencil display (backcross males) and the male's ability to clasp the female genitalia. Overall, 63% of H. subflexa and 33% of backcross pairs culminated the courtship sequence with successful mating. The tendency of backcross males to settle down after limited flight activity contributed greatly to the increased proportion of unsuccessful males.

Genetic isolation and cryptic variation within the Lycaena xanthoides species group (Lepidoptera : Lycaenidae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						California; geographical barriers; hybridization; mtDNA; transverse ranges	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; PAPILIO-MACHAON; POPULATION; PATTERNS; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION; INTROGRESSION	Species exist as biological entities with patterns of discontinuous phenotypic variation. However, the distinctness of taxa is called into question when morphological intermediates exist in areas of sympatry, reflecting either gene flow among variants of a species or hybridization between different species. Studying the partitioning of genetic variation provides a means to discern between the two possibilities. We used genetic and morphometric approaches to investigate the degree of isolation among the three members of the Lycaena xanthoides species group. Lycaena xanthoides, L. editha, and L. dione are predominantly allopatric and have been treated both as three separate species and as a single polytypic species. Using 618 bp of the mitochondrial gene COII, we found little phylogenetic resolution, but significant among-taxa genetic variance partitioning. Divergence among these taxa has been relatively recent, as evidenced by relatively low pairwise sequence divergence. Also, the existence of two well-supported clades within L. xanthoides sensu stricto, concordant with the Transverse Ranges of southern California, indicates divergence within this taxon, and a possible cryptic species. Significant morphological differentiation between L. editha and L. xanthoides supports the hypothesis that these taxa represent separate gene pools. Populations occurring in a narrow zone where the two species' ranges approach are characterized by intermediate morphology, suggesting incomplete morphological divergence or recent hybridization. These findings highlight the utility of genetic data in inferring species boundaries and the identification of cryptic lineages.

Mark			The role of latitudinal, genetic and temperature variation in the induction of diapause of Papilio glaucus (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae)	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						adaptation; critical photoperiod; development; diapauses; facultative; hybridization	TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLIES; SEX-LINKED DIAPAUSE; PHOTOPERIODIC RESPONSE; HYBRID ZONE; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; INSECT DIAPAUSE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTROGRESSION; POPULATION; CANADENSIS	A key adaptation in insects for dealing with variable environmental conditions is the ability to diapause. The tiger swallowtail butterflies, Papilio glaucus and P. canadensis are ideal species to explore the genetic causes and population genetic consequences of diapause because divergence in this trait is believed to be a salient factor in maintaining a hybrid zone between these species. Yet little is known about the factors that influence diapause induction in this system. Here we explored how spatial (latitudinal), environmental (temperature) and genetic (hybridization) factors affect diapause induction in this system. Specifically, a series of growth chamber experiments using wild caught individuals from across the eastern United States were performed to: (1) evaluate how critical photoperiod varies with latitude, (2) isolate the stage in which induction occurs, (3) test whether changes in temperature affected rates of diapause induction, and (4) explore how the incidence of diapause is affected in hybrid offspring. We find that induction occurs in the larval stage, is not sensitive to a relatively broad range of temperatures, appears to have a complex genetic basis (i.e., is not simply a dominant trait following a Mendelian inheritance pattern) and that the critical photoperiod increases by 0.4 h with each increasing degree in latitude. This work deepens our understanding of how spatial, environmental and genetic variation influences a key seasonal adaptation (diapause induction) in a well-developed ecological model system and will make possible future studies that explore how climatic variation affects the population dynamics and genetics of this system.

Hybridization often occurs along these contact zones. In Europe, the high mountain systems of the Alps and Pyrenees are well known for their hybrid belts. This article studies the contact zone of the Woodland Ringlet Erebia medusa in a Hercynian mountain area in the Czech-German border region not exceeding 1500 m a.s.l. Hybrid populations between an eastern and a western genetic lineage were detected by AMOVA-based tests, principal component analysis and neighbour joining analysis. Over most of the range of the Czech-German Border Mts, the ridges separate the western and the eastern genetic lineage from each other. However, two important hybrid areas were detected: (1) the watershed of the Ohre river in the north-west of that area, a major valley system passing through these mountains and (2) the high plateaux of the Sumava Mts in the south-east, an extended area of high elevation. The location of hybrid populations in geographical vicinity to non-hybrid populations and the generally low F-IS (2.1%) make reduced fitness of hybrid individuals little likely. The hybrid populations have intermediate genetic diversity between the genetically poor western and the genetically rich eastern lineage populations.

Adaptive introgression of herbivore resistance traits in the weedy sunflower Helianthus annuus	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						adaptive trait introgression; herbivory; hybridization; natural selection; range expansion; seed predation	NATURAL-SELECTION; WILD SUNFLOWER; SESQUITERPENE LACTONES; HOMOEOSOMA-ELECTELLUM; SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; SEED PREDATION; HYBRIDIZATION; ORIGIN; EVOLUTION; ADAPTATION	The role of hybridization in adaptive evolution is contentious. While many cases of adaptive trait introgression have been proposed, the relevant traits have rarely been identified, resulting in a lack of clear examples of this process. Here, we examine a purported case of adaptive introgression in which the annual sunflower Helianthus annuus annuus has captured alleles from a congener ( Helianthus debilis) to form a stabilized hybrid, Helianthus annuus texanus. We tested the hypotheses that herbivore resistance traits have introgressed from H. debilis to H. annuus and have increased adaptation in the latter. In two common gardens, fitness ( estimated by seed production) was on average 55% higher in H. a. texanus than in H. a. annuus. For H. a. texanus, three damage traits ( of seven tested) differed significantly from the H. a. annuus parent in one or both sites and were shifted in the direction of the more resistant H. debilis. Natural selection favored H. a. debilis BC 1 hybrids ( synthesized to mimic the ancestors of H. a. texanus) with H. debilis - like resistance to seed midges Neolasioptera helianthis and to receptacle/seed feeding Lepidoptera at one or both sites. Assuming similar herbivore pressures in the past, these results suggest that introgression of biotic resistance traits was important in the adaptation of H. annuus to central and southern Texas.

However, nothing is known about viral infection in populations of forest caterpillars that declined to low density. We used DNA dot-blot hybridization to identify viral infection in caterpillars collected from 6 field populations of forest tent caterpillars in the vicinity of Prince George, BC. Over the 5 yr of observations, populations at 4 sites declined from high to low densities. Viral infection was generally highest among caterpillars from dense and declining populations but persisted at low levels in sparse populations. Populations at 2 sites which erupted in the last 2 yr of the study had levels of infection comparable to populations which were at high density at the beginning of the study.

At least 34 individuals are known from various locations. However, the absence of females suggests a hybrid origin, and E. epiphron and either E. pronoe or E. manto have been proposed as possible parents. Electrophoretic analysis of five allozyme loci and sequencing of three mitochondrial DNA segments and one nuclear gene now demonstrate that E. serotina results from the cross between E. epiphron females and E. pronoe males. We have used our and previously published sequence data to generate a molecular phylogenetic tree of the genus Erebia which shows that these two species are only distantly related. The question of why they happen to hybridize on a seemingly routine basis is thus raised.

A spatially localized allochronic summer population (SP) of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa, recently discovered in Portugal, occurs in sympatry with the local winter population (WP). We examined the level of genetic differentiation between the two populations and estimated the current gene flow within the spatial framework of their co-occurrence. Mitochondrial data indicated that the two sympatric populations were genetically closer than other WP populations. Conversely, microsatellite genotyping uncovered greater differentiation between the two sympatric populations than between allopatric ones. While male trapping confirmed that reproduction of SP and WP occurred at distinct times, clustering approaches demonstrated the presence of a few LateSP individuals emerging within the WP flight period, although genetically identified as SP. We also identified rare recent hybridization events apparently occurring mainly in the margins of the current SP range. The ongoing gene flow detected between the ancestral and the emerging allochronic populations revealed an incomplete reproductive isolation, which must therefore be taken into account and integrated with studies focussed on ecological drivers, so that a complete understanding of the ongoing speciation process might be achieved.

The work was conducted in Montenegro, RS, in a tangor 'Murcott' hybrid orchard. Samplings were taken every fortnightly, from May, 2003 to May, 2004, collecting in each occasion all plants and or branches with mines found in a area delimited by an 0.28 m(2) arch thrown in the lines and between lines of 30 randomly chosen trees. The host plants of the leafminers were collected for identification. Eleven species of Lepidoptera leafminers were found distributed in six families, collected in 15 species of host plants of nine botanical families. The community of plants of spontaneous growth in the studied area hosted a huge diversity of Lepidoptera leafminers, including possible new families; however it did not hosted P. citrella.

Hybrid unfitness usually evolves first in the heterogametic sex-a pattern known as Haldane's rule. The genetics of Haldane's rule have been extensively studied in species where the male is the heterogametic (XX/XY) sex, but its basis in taxa where the female is heterogametic (ZW/ZZ), such as Lepidoptera and birds, is largely unknown. Here, we analyse a new case of female hybrid sterility between geographic subspecies of Heliconius pardalinus. The two subspecies mate freely in captivity, but female F1 hybrids in both directions of cross are sterile. Sterility is due to arrested development of oocytes after they become differentiated from nurse cells, but before yolk deposition. We backcrossed fertile male F1 hybrids to parental females and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for female sterility. We also identified genes differentially expressed in the ovary as a function of oocyte development. The Z chromosome has a major effect, similar to the 'large X effect' in Drosophila, with strong epistatic interactions between loci at either end of the Z chromosome, and between the Z chromosome and autosomal loci on chromosomes 8 and 20. By intersecting the list of genes within these QTLs with those differentially expressed in sterile and fertile hybrids, we identified three candidate genes with relevant phenotypes. This study is the first to characterize hybrid sterility using genome mapping in the Lepidoptera and shows that it is produced by multiple complex epistatic interactions often involving the sex chromosome, as predicted by the dominance theory of Haldane's rule.

Males from reciprocal interspecies crosses had hair-pencil glands the structure of which -resembled those of H. virescens males. Backcross males from crosses between (H. virescens female x H. subflexa male) F1 x H. subflexa male lacked hair-pencil glands and were morphologically similar to H. subflexa males. The hair-pencil glands of first-generation backcross males from all other combinations resembled those of H. virescens. Second-generation backcross males from crosses, in which both Z chromosomes were inherited from H. subflexa, lacked hair pencils. However, second-generation backcross males that inherited at least one of the Z chromosomes from H. virescens were phenotypically similar to H. virescens. These results indicated that the presence of hair-pencil glands is regulated by a dominant allele of a locus or a group of genes located on the Z chromosome of H. virescens.

A notable case is that of Iphiclides feisthamelii which, after more than 180 years since description, still has a debated status, being often considered as a subspecies of Iphiclides podalirius. To elucidate the relationship between the two taxa and the evolutionary processes that led to their separation, we combine mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (mtDNA and nDNA) data, Wolbachia screening, genitalia morphology and wing UV reflectance. Our results show that the two taxa clearly differ in male and female genital morphology, male wing UV reflectance and nDNA. Two Wolbachia strains were found to widely infect the studied samples, apparently explaining the phylogeographic pattern displayed by mtDNA. The available data point towards a historical Wolbachia infection that spread from I. podalirius to I. feisthamelii and produced a mitochondrial introgression. Currently, a new Wolbachia strain is spreading across mainland populations of I. podalirius, mediating once more a mitochondrial genetic sweep, which has already infected and introgressed I. feisthamelii populations in south-eastern France. We conclude that, given the marked differences in morphology and nDNA between the two taxa, and the apparent restriction of hybridization to a narrow contact area where non-hybrid specimens are common, the taxon feisthamelii should be considered as a separate species. Within this species, two well-differentiated nDNA lineages that represent European and Maghrebian populations are documented, here proposed as subspecies. The case of, presumably, two consecutive Wolbachia-mediated mitochondrial introgression events, further supports the view that infection by this endosymbiont may be frequently related to mito-nuclear discordance in insects.

M. ornata and its close relatives (with a focus on M. phoebe) from the Palearctic were analysed based on five gene regions (COI, EF-1a, MDH, RPS5, and wingless) using Bayesian methods to infer the phylogeographic history. The DNA-based analyses have been complemented with species distribution modelling (SDM) and Wolbachia screening. The Bayesian inference analysis showed mito-nuclear discordance in M. ornata, which is split into an eastern and a western clade. Based on mitochondrial DNA, the western clade of M. ornata clusters together with M. phoebe, while the eastern clade is well-separated. In contrast to this, the combined nuDNA-based analysis revealed that M. ornata forms a monophyletic group which is clearly separated from M. phoebe. The timing of divergence analyses suggest that the split between M. ornata and M. phoebe is about 6 million years old based on both the COI and the concatenated nuclear genes. SDM predicted considerably larger area shifts for M. phoebe than for M. ornata. LGM refugia were predicted for both species to the Mediterranean peninsulas in Europe and several Middle-East and Asian localities. The prevalence of Wolbachia infection was 88.9% in M. phoebe and only 7% in M. ornata. Our results clearly indicate a lack of ongoing hybridization between M. phoebe and M. ornata, but argue for an ancient hybridization event in the Apennine Peninsula which strongly influenced the observed split between the two clades of M. ornata.

Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed.

In this study, we analysed the Chalk-hill Blue Polyommatus coridon all along the contact zone of two expansive lineages. This zone stretches from the sandy areas of north-eastern Germany, along the mountain ranges of the GermanCzech border and throughout the eastern Alps. We studied allozymes (19 loci) of 38 populations (1542 individuals) and compared these data sets against 15 populations of the western and 15 populations of the eastern lineages and found different degrees of hybridization. Thus, the calcareous regions of Thuringia and Sachsen-Anhalt were mostly colonized by the western lineage. The middle mountain ranges between Bavaria and Bohemia represented a strong barrier blocking further expansion and thus completely impeding hybridization in this region. More intense hybridization was detected in the populations of the eastern Alps, especially in the north-eastern part, where the Danube most probably acted as an expansion corridor for both lineages followed by intensive hybridization. In the south-eastern Alps, hybrid populations were mostly detected in the easternmost parts and along the larger river valley of Drava and Mur; pure western populations dominated in the other areas of this region. These results show that the degree of hybridization along a contact zone is correlated with the ecological demands of a species and the regional physical geographic circumstances. This finding was proved for the Chalk-hill Blue in our study but is also the most likely scenario in most animal and plant species.

(Myrtaceae). The objective of this study was the report, for the first time, T. amathealis in Indonesia as well as to record new host plants for this insect. Were collected manually from a Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill. x Eucalyptus pellita F. Muell. hybrid commercial plantation in Riau, Sumatra, Indonesia and a sample sent for identification via molecular analysis. Our findings revealed that the molecular approach used (through sequencing of its mt-COI gene) successfully allowed the identification of the species as T. amathealis.

Cladistic analysis of 49 distinct haplotypes (haplotype and nucleotide diversity were 0.95 and 0.027, respectively) revealed strong phylogeographic structure in M cinxia, characterised by four major clades: Morocco; Western (Iberia, France, Italy); Central (central and northern Western Europe, Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, Levant); and Eastern (eastern Baltic, Urals, Iran, Siberia, China); separated by average pairwise distances of beween 2 and 6 percent. This pattern is consistent with the location of southern glacial refugia in the Iberian, Italian and Balkan peninsulas, as well as multiple eastern refugia. The Western clade is further structured into south-central Iberian, northern Iberian (and French) and southern Italian sub-clades; and the Eastern clade into Near Eastern and Far Eastern sub-clades; with weaker phylogeographical concordance within the Central clade, except for a large area in central and northern Western Europe which is monomorphic for COI haplotype. The Baltic and eastern Europe have been primarily colonized by the Far Eastern sub-clade, rather than the Central (Balkan) clade, highlighting the importance of including Near and Far Eastern populations in phylogeographic studies of Palearctic species. Maps showing them extent of clades and sub-clades suggest several regions of secondary contact and possible hybridization. Interspecific comparison of representative M cinxia haplotypes supports a monophyletic origin of all M cinxia.

Climate-mediated hybrid zone movement revealed with genomics, museum collection, and simulation modeling	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT; TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLIES; PAPILIO-GLAUCUS-CANADENSIS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; HYBRIDIZATION; LEPIDOPTERA; DIVERGENCE; EVOLUTION; TRAITS; DISTRIBUTIONS	Climate-mediated changes in hybridization will dramatically alter the genetic diversity, adaptive capacity, and evolutionary trajectory of interbreeding species. Our ability to predict the consequences of such changes will be key to future conservation and management decisions. Here we tested through simulations how recent warming (over the course of a 32-y period) is affecting the geographic extent of a climate-mediated developmental threshold implicated in maintaining a butterfly hybrid zone (Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis; Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). These simulations predict a 68-km shift of this hybrid zone. To empirically test this prediction, we assessed genetic and phenotypic changes using contemporary and museum collections and document a 40-km northward shift of this hybrid zone. Interactions between the two species appear relatively unchanged during hybrid zone movement. We found no change in the frequency of hybridization, and regions of the genome that experience little to no introgression moved largely in concert with the shifting hybrid zone. Model predictions based on climate scenarios predict this hybrid zone will continue to move northward, but with substantial spatial heterogeneity in the velocity (55-144 km/1 degrees C), shape, and contiguity of movement. Our findings suggest that the presence of nonclimatic barriers (e.g., genetic incompatibilities) and/or nonlinear responses to climatic gradients may preserve species boundaries as the species shift. Further, we show that variation in the geography of hybrid zone movement could result in evolutionary responses that differ for geographically distinct populations spanning hybrid zones, and thus have implications for the conservation and management of genetic diversity.

In order to clarify the phylogeo-graphic history of the species, we used sequences of three mitochondrial (COI, Cyt b and ND5) and two nuclear (Rp15 and Ldh) genes of 207 individuals collected from 55 sites throughout Japan and five sites on the Asian continent. Phylogenetic trees and the median-joining network revealed six evolutionary mitochondrial haplotype clades, which corresponded to the geographic distribution of the species. Common ancestors of Japanese T. fischeri might have come to Japan during the mid-Pleistocene by multiple dispersals of continental populations, probably via a land bridge or narrow channel between western Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The geographical patterns of variation of mitochondrial and nuclear markers are discordant in northeastern Kyushu, possibly as a result of introgressive hybridization during the ancient contact between the Kyushu and Shikoku populations in the last glacial maximum. The phylogeographic pattern of T. fischeri in Japan are probably related to the geological history, Pleistocene climatic oscillations and distribution of the host plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In all 19 studied individuals, we found the haploid chromosome number n = 26, including 7 pairs of relatively large and 19 pairs of relatively small chromosomes. According to the chromosome number and karyotype structure, the studied population does not differ from P. (A.) damocles krymaeus (Sheljuzhko, 1928) from the eastern part of the Crimean Mountains. This result does not confirm the previously formulated hypotheses, according to which (1) two morphologically similar but karyologically different species, P. (A.) poseidon and P. (A.) damocles krymaeus, occur sympatrically in the Crimea and (2) there is hybridization between these taxa on the Angarskiy Pass.

This effect is known in parasites that find mates using host cues, but studies of larch- and pine-feeding races of the larch budmoth (Zeiraphera diniana, Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) suggest it may also occur when mate attraction is via sex pheromones that are independent of habitat. We have previously shown that females releasing pheromones on or near their own host attract more males of their own race than if placed on the alternative host. This host effect would enhance assortative mating provided adults preferentially alight on their native hosts. Here we investigate alighting preferences in natural mixed forest using a novel likelihood analysis of genotypic clusters based on three semidiagnostic allozyme loci. Both larch and pine females show a realized alighting preference for their own host of 86%. The equivalent preferences of males were 79% for the larch race and 85% for the pine race. These preferences are also detectable in small-scale laboratory experiments, where alighting preferences of larch and pine races towards their own hosts were, respectively, 67 and 66% in females and 69 and 63% in males. Pure larch race moths reared in the laboratory had alighting choice similar to moths from natural populations, while hybrids were intermediate, showing that alighting preferences were heritable and approximately additive. The field estimates of alighting preference, coupled with earlier work on mate choice, yield an estimated rate of natural hybridization between sympatric host races of 2.2-3.8% per generation. Divergent alighting choice enhances pheromone-mediated assortative mating today, and is likely to have been an important cause of assortative mating during initial divergence in host use. Because resources are normally 'coarse-grained' in space and time, assortative mating due to ecological divergence may be a more important catalyst of sympatric speciation than generally realized.

Male and female individuals of having lowest virulence were crossbred with other strain females and males in vitro conditions. Ten different strains were obtained by hybridization and their virulence was compared with their parent and each other on the last instar larvae of G. melonella. The results showed that 70% of hybridized strains were more effective than their parents. The results indicated that male and female individuals have different effect on the virulence of the hybridized strains. The hybridized strains, which were more effective than their parents, were influenced from female with 42.9% and from male with 57.1%.

Comparative efficacy of Bt maize events MON810 and Bt11 against Sesamia calamistis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in South Africa	CROP PROTECTION			English	Review						Bt maize; Lepidoptera; MON810; Bt11; Sesamia calamistis		Maize, expressing Cry1 Ab insecticidal proteins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), was introduced for control of Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in South Africa in 1998. In the light of the reportedly lower toxicity of Bt maize to certain noctuid borers, the effect of Bt maize was evaluated on Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in South Africa. The characteristic larval behaviour of S. calamistis may result in reduced exposure to Bt toxin and subsequent high levels of survival since larvae do not feed on plant whorls like other borer species, but penetrate stems directly from behind leaf sheaths. Growth and survival of larvae were determined in a greenhouse bioassay with two Bt maize hybrids (Monsanto event MON810 and Syngenta event Bt11) and their non-Bt, isoline hybrids. Potted plants were artificially infested with 1st instar larvae. Percentage larval survival and mean larval mass were recorded over time. Bt maize of both events was shown to be highly toxic to S. calamistis. No larvae survived longer than 9 days on plants of either of the Bt events. S. calamistis is stenophagous and occurs in mixed populations with other borer species, with which it shares several parasitoid species in Africa. The ecological impact of local extinction of S. calamistis caused by this highly effective transgenic event is therefore not expected to be great. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Genome Assembly of the Dogface Butterfly Zerene cesonia	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Lepidoptera; de novo assembly; comparative genomics; Hi-Rise assembly	CHROMOSOME EVOLUTION; LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIATION; SILKWORM	Comparisons of high-quality, reference butterfly, and moth genomes have been instrumental to advancing our understanding of how hybridization, and natural selection drive genomic change during the origin of new species and novel traits. Here, we present a genome assembly of the Southern Dogface butterfly, Zerene cesonia (Pieridae) whose brilliant wing colorations have been implicated in developmental plasticity, hybridization, sexual selection, and speciation. We assembled 266,407,278 bp of theZ. cesonia genome, which accounts for 98.3% of the estimated 271 Mb genome size. Using a hybrid approach involving Chicago libraries with Hi-Rise assembly and a diploid Meraculous assembly, the final haploid genome was assembled. In the final assembly, nearly all autosomes and the Z chromosome were assembled into single scaffolds. The largest 29 scaffolds accounted for 91.4% of the genome assembly, with the remaining similar to 8% distributed among another 247 scaffolds and overall N50 of 9.2 Mb. Tissue-specific RNA-seq informed annotations identified 16,442 protein-coding genes, which included 93.2% of the arthropod Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO). The Z. cesonia genome assembly had similar to 9% identified as repetitive elements, with a transposable element landscape rich in helitrons. Similar to other Lepidoptera genomes, Z. cesonia showed a high conservation of chromosomal synteny. The Z. cesonia assembly provides a high-quality reference for studies of chromosomal arrangements in the Pierid family, as well as for population, phylo, and functional genomic studies of adaptation and speciation.

We placed 1-year-old plants, grown from seeds generated from controlled crosses, in a common garden. During the growing season, we censused gall-inducing flies and sawflies, leaf-mining insects, and leaf-folding Lepidoptera to determine the community structure of herbivorous insects on the six genetic classes. Our results provided convincing evidence that the community structure of insect herbivores in this hybrid willow system was shaped by genetic differences among the parental species and the hybrid genetic classes. Using MANOVA, we detected significant differences among genetic classes for both absolute and relative abundance of herbivores. Using canonical discriminant analysis, we found that centroid locations describing community structure of the insect herbivores differed for each genetic class. Moreover, the centroids for the four hybrid classes were located well outside of the range between the centroids for the parental species, suggesting that more than additive genetic effects of the two parental species influenced community formation on hybrid classes. Line-cross analysis suggested that plant genetic factors responsible for structuring the herbivore community involved epistatic effects, as well as additive and dominance effects. We discuss the ramifications of these results in regard to the structure of insect herbivore communities on plants and the implications of our findings for the evolution of interspecific interactions.

A study with Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera : Delphacidae) and Marasmia patnalis (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						heterosis; heterobeltiosis; hybrid rice; host plant resistance; antibiosis	CNAPHALOCROCIS-MEDINALIS GUENEE; MAIZE; BORER	Antibiosis-based resistance to two insect pests of rice, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) and Marasmia patnalis Bradley (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was compared in 11 F-1 hybrids and their parental lines. Our objective was to determine whether hybrids show heterosis (hybrid vigor) for insect resistance or susceptibility. Heterosis is defined as the amount by which a hybrid exceeds its midparent value or its better parent. Overall, we did not find evidence of heterosis or heterobeltiosis (a type of heterosis in which a hybrid exceeds its better parent) for antibiosis-based resistance or susceptibility to either of the insects. One hybrid, IR64616H, seemed more resistant to M. patnalis than its better parent but none of the other hybrids showed heterobeltiosis for resistance or susceptibility to either insect. Three hybrids bad resistance to N. lugens that exceeded their midparent value, possibly due to dominant resistance in one of the parents. The increased frequency and severity of insect outbreaks on hybrid rice that have been reported in China may be attributable to factors other than diminished antibiosis in hybrids, such as greater attractiveness of hybrids to migrating or dispersing insects or differences in agronomic practices applied to hybrids and inbred rice cultivars.

The goldenrod elliptical-gall moth, Gnorimoschema gallaesolidaginis, attacks two goldenrods in the Solidago canadensis complex: S. altissima and S. gigantea (Asteraceae). We tested for host-associated genetic differentiation in G. gallaesolidaginis via analysis of variation at 12 allozyme loci among larvae collected at six sites in Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Gnorimoschema gallaesolidaginis from each host are highly polymorphic (3.6-4.7 alleles/locus and expected heterozygosity 0.28-0.38 within site-host combinations). Although there were no fixed differences between larvae from S. altissima and S. gigantea at any site, these represent well differentiated host forms, with 11 of 12 loci showing significantly different allele frequencies between host-associated collections at one or more sites. Host plant has a larger effect on genetic structure among populations than does location (Wright's F-ST = 0.16 between host forms vs. F-ST = 0.061 and 0.026 among altissima and gigantea populations, respectively). The estimated F-ST between host forms suggests that the historical effective rate of gene flow has been low (N(e)m approximate to 1.3). Consistent with this historical estimate is the absence of detectable recombinant (hybrid and introgressant between host form) individuals in contemporary populations (none of 431 genotyped individuals). Upper 95% confidence limits for the frequency of recombinant individuals range from 5% to 9%. Host association is tight, but imperfect, with only one likely example of a host mismatch (a larva galling the wrong host species). Our inferences about hybridization and host association are based on new maximum-likelihood methods for estimating frequencies of genealogical classes (in this case, two parental classes, F-1 and F-2 hybrids, and backcrosses) in a population and for assigning individuals to genealogical classes. We describe these new methods in the context of their application to genetic structure in G. gallaesolidaginis. Population phenograms are consistent with the origin of the host forms (at least in the midwestern United States) via a single host shift: altissima and gigantea moth populations form distinct lineages with 100% bootstrap support. Genetic structure in Gnorimoschema is of particular interest because another gallmaking insect attacking the same pair of hosts, the tephritid fly Eurosta solidaginis, includes a pair of host races with partial reproductive isolation. Gnorimoschema gallaesolidaginis and E. solidaginis therefore represent the first reported case of parallel host-associated differentiation, that is, differentiation by evolutionarily independent insect lineages across the same pair of host plants.

Random polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used to generate species specific markers and sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit one gene for determination of the progeny. RAPD's clustering and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny were congruent with the taxonomic placement of specimens of both species, but slightly incongruent with the results of the analysis of genital morphology. Two specimens with L. reali genitalia measurements, but genetically belonging to L. sinapis, had species specific RAPD markers of both species indicating probable hybrid origin. All the specimens with genitalia of intermediate length were also genetically assigned to L. sinapis indicating a possible one way introgression as predicted from their genitalia morphology. Leptidea sinapis was found predominantly in xerothermic habitats in Slovenia, whereas L. reali was more of a generalist except in the sub-Mediterranean region where it is limited to humid meadows.

Olfactory neuron responsiveness and pheromone blend preference in hybrids between Ostrinia furnacalis and Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera : Crambidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						olfactory receptor neurons; hybridization; pheromone shift; single-sensillum recordings; electrophysiology	EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; SINGLE CELL RESPONSES; SMALL ERMINE MOTHS; SEX-PHEROMONE; RECEPTOR NEURONS; ANTENNAL SENSILLA; INHERITANCE; COMPONENTS; PYRALIDAE; DISCRIMINATION	The olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) and behavioral responses of hybrids between the Asian corn borer (ACB), Ostrinia furnacalis, and the E-strain European corn borer (ECB(E)), Ostrinia nubilalis were examined and compared to the parental populations. In hybrids and both parents, the large-spike-size ORN was capable of responding to all four pheromone components of ACB and ECB, despite differences in which compounds elicited the greatest spike frequency in each population. There was a small-spiking ORN more narrowly tuned to the minor pheromone components in both ACB and ECB(E). In hybrids the homologous small-spiking ORN was tuned primarily to the ECB(E) minor pheromone component, with some responsiveness to the ACB minor component. Both species and all the hybrids had an intermediate spike-size ORN tuned primarily to their common behavioral antagonist. Dominance of responsiveness to the ECB(E) versus the ACB minor pheromone component on the small-spiking ORN may explain the greater tendency of hybrids to fly upwind to the ECB(E) pheromone blend than the ACB blend. This finding points toward a distinct evolutionary role for this ORN in allowing a pheromone shift. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative analyses of this kind were previously conducted in Drosophila, Lepidoptera, frogs, ducks, and birds in general. In the present study, we used information from the literature to analyze hybrid inviability in relation to species divergence in pigeons and doves. Four main patterns arose from this analysis: (1) as in the other groups studied, F-1 hybrid inviability gradually increases as species diverge, the time needed to reach total inviability being higher in birds than in the other groups; (2) as expected, the presence of geographic overlap does not influence the evolution of postzygotic isolation; (3) the percentage of unhatched eggs does not differ between hybrids of the first generation and the backcrosses, but it increases in the second hybrid generation; and (4) pigeons and doves follow Haldane's rule, as found in the other groups studied so far. The similarity between the results of this and previous studies contributes to the growing evidence suggesting that the patterns of the evolution of postzygotic isolation, and the process of speciation in general, are shared among animal groups.

PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Epidendroideae; Epidendrum; Laeliinae; Orchidaceae; pollination; reproductive biology	FRUIT PRODUCTION; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; CROSS-POLLINATION; SELF-POLLINATION; LIMITATIONS; EVOLUTION; MIMICRY; ECOLOGY	The phenology, flower morphology, pollination mechanism and reproductive biology of Epidendrum secundum were studied in a semi-deciduous forest at the Serra do Japi (SJ), and in the Atlantic rain forest of Picinguaba, both natural reserves in the State of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil. E. secundum flowers all year round, with a flowering peak between September and January. This species is either a lithophytic or terrestrial herb in the SJ, whereas, in Picinguaba, it grows mainly in disturbed areas along roadsides. E. secundum is pollinated by several species of diurnal Lepidoptera at both study sites. In Picinguaba, where E. secundum is sympatric with E. fulgens and both share the same pollinators, pollen transference between these two species was recorded. E. secundum is self-compatible but pollinator-dependent. It is inter-compatible with E. fulgens, producing fertile seeds. In contrast to the population of the SJ, in the Picinguaba region, floral morphology is quite variable among plants and some individuals present flowers with characteristics in-between both sympatric species, suggesting that natural hybridization occasionally occurs. The anthropogenic perturbation is probably the cause of the occurrence of E. secundum in the Picinguaba region, enabling its contact with E. fulgens.	[Pansarin, E. R.; Amaral, M. C.

Recent patterns of hybridization and introgression suggest a more complex interaction between the two, possibly even resulting in the formation of a new species (Pterourus appalachiensis Pavulaan & Wright, 2002). Recently, extensive northward interspecific introgression of P. glaucus-diagnostic traits has been observed in the hybrid zone. These include wing bands and other color patterns, the ability to feed on tulip tree leaves, and Hk-100 allozymes; all are autosomally encoded. However, there has been little northward introgression of certain other P. glaucus traits (such as facultative diapause and bivoltinism, and Ldh-100 allozymes, both X-linked; and the Y-linked melanic mimicry gene in females). Interspecific recombination of the X-chromosome has evidently occurred, as shown by discordant patterns of X-linked markers. The P. glaucus X-linked Pgd-100 and Pgd-50 alleles have introgressed 200-400 km north of the historical hybrid zone, yet the P. glaucus X-linked Ldh-100 allele has not. The allele frequency shift for both genes is more closely related to the 'thermal landscape' (i.e., accumulated degree-days above a developmental base threshold of 50 degrees F (=10 degrees C)) than to latitude. Delayed post-diapause eclosion of cohorts within the hybrid zone, e.g., the New York/Vermont border area, has produced a natural 'false-second generation' flight (a hybrid swarm of synchronous males and females, where 2300-2700 degrees F degree-days have accumulated each year since 1998) that is reproductively isolated from flights of both parental species. Moreover, the newly described P. appalachiensis exhibits a unique combination of traits. These include obligate diapause, a univoltine habit, and the Ldh-80 or Ldh-40 alleles (as for P. canadensis), the Pgd-100 or Pgd-50 alleles (as for P. glaucus), and a delayed 'false-second generation' reproductive flight period (as observed in the hybrid zone). Since 2001, a rare allele or 'hybrizyme' (Ldh-20) has appeared in this false second generation at high frequencies (40-50%). We hypothesize that strong selection against the facultative diapause (od-)trait (and the linked Ldh-100 allele) in regions with 2800 degrees F degree-days or less, and divergent selection in favor of Pgd-100 (or a closely linked trait) combined with allochronic reproductive isolation, has resulted in recombinational, parapatric, hybrid speciation. There is no evidence at present that host-plant shifts or changes in sex pheromones have driven this process, in contrast to many other speciation events in the Lepidoptera.

Here we reconstruct the phylogeny of the group using multi-locus coalescent-based methods on seven independent genetic markers. While the genus is ca. 4.9 Mya old, the diversification of the extant lineages was extremely recent (ca. 1.5 Mya) and involved multiple chromosomal rearrangements. We find that relationships are uncertain due to both incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization. Minimizing the impact of reticulation in inferring the species tree by testing for mitochondria] introgression events yields a partially resolved tree with three main supported clades: L. punctifera + L. bellargus, the corydonius taxa, and L coridon + the Iberian taxa, plus three independent lineages without apparently close relatives (L. ossmar, L syriaca and L. dezina). Based on these results and new karyotypic data, we propose a rearrangement recognizing ten species within the genus. Finally, we hypothesize that chromosomal instability may have played a crucial role in the Lysandra recent diversification. New chromosome rearrangements might be fixed in populations after severe bottlenecks, which at the same time might promote rapid sorting of neutral molecular markers. We argue that population bottlenecks might be a prerequisite for chromosomal speciation in this group. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fusarium graminearum Mycotoxins in Maize Associated With Striacosta albicosta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Injury	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bt corn; Lepidoptera; injury; mycotoxins; deoxynivalenol	WESTERN BEAN CUTWORM; TRANSGENIC CORN HYBRIDS; GIBBERELLA EAR ROT; IN-FIELD CORN; SMITH LEPIDOPTERA; DEOXYNIVALENOL CONTENT; UNITED-STATES; BT; ONTARIO; WHEAT	Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) has become a key pest of maize, Zea mays (L.), in Ontario, Canada which is challenging to control due to its lack of susceptibility to most Bt-maize events. Injury by S. albicosta may exacerbate Fusarium graminearum (Schwabe; Hypocreales: Nectriaceae) infection through provision of entry points on the ear. The objectives of this study were to: investigate the relationship between injury by S. albicosta and deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation; evaluate non-Bt and Bt-maize hybrids, with and without insecticide and fungicide application; and determine optimal insecticide-fungicide application timing for reducing S. albicosta injury and DON accumulation.The incidence of injury by S. albicosta and ear rot severity were found to increase DON concentrations under favorable environmental conditions for E graminearum infection. Incidence of S. albicosta injury was more important than severity of injury for DON accumulation which may be due to larval consumption of infected kernels. The Vip3A x Cry1Ab event provided superior protection from the incidence and severity of S. albicosta injury compared to non-Bt or Cty1F hybrids. Insecticide application to a Vip3A x Cry1Ab hybrid did not reduce injury further; however, lower severity of injury was observed for non-Bt and Cry1F hybrids when pyrethroids or diamides were applied at early VT or R1 stages. DON concentrations were reduced with application of prothioconazole fungicide tank-mixed with insecticide at late VT (before silk browning) or when insecticide was applied at early VT followed by prothioconazole at R1. The application of an insecticide/fungicide tank-mix is the most efficient approach for maize hybrids lacking high-dose insecticidal proteins against S. albicosta and F graminearum tolerance. Results demonstrate that reducing the risk of DON accumulation requires a strategic approach to manage complex associations among S. albicosta, E graminearum and the environment.

Heliconius Genome Consortium	Butterfly genome reveals promiscuous exchange of mimicry adaptations among species	NATURE			English	Article							GENE FLOW; HELICONIUS; EVOLUTION; HYBRIDIZATION; SYNTENY; LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIATION; KARYOTYPE; INSIGHTS	The evolutionary importance of hybridization and introgression has long been debated(1). Hybrids are usually rare and unfit, but even infrequent hybridization can aid adaptation by transferring beneficial traits between species. Here we use genomic tools to investigate introgression in Heliconius, a rapidly radiating genus of neotropical butterflies widely used in studies of ecology, behaviour, mimicry and speciation(2-5). We sequenced the genome of Heliconius melpomene and compared it with other taxa to investigate chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera and gene flow among multiple Heliconius species and races. Among 12,669 predicted genes, biologically important expansions of families of chemosensory and Hox genes are particularly noteworthy. Chromosomal organization has remained broadly conserved since the Cretaceous period, when butterflies split from the Bombyx (silkmoth) lineage. Using genomic resequencing, we show hybrid exchange of genes between three co-mimics, Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius timareta and Heliconius elevatus, especially at two genomic regions that control mimicry pattern. We infer that closely related Heliconius species exchange protective colour-pattern genes promiscuously, implying that hybridization has an important role in adaptive radiation.

Although this strain has been maintained free of pyrethroid insecticides, most tobacco budworm populations have been exposed to pyrethroids and have demonstrated enhanced tolerance. Our estimated LD50 (cypermethrin) for third instars was significantly lower than tobacco budworm from Mississippi. Thus, the TBW-BC strain could be at a disadvantage if exposed to pyrethroids after release. We developed a lineage of TBW-BC strain that is resistant to cypermethrin by repeatedly backcrossing TBW-BC females to resistant tobacco budworm males and selecting for tolerance. Resistant TBW-BC strain (R-TBW-BC) (LD50, 638-mu-g per larva) should survive field applications that would kill most wild tobacco budworm. Backcross mortalities were consistent with polygenic inheritance, but not with monogenic inheritance. Release of R-TBW-BC strain cannot change tolerance in wild tobacco budworm, because introduced resistance alleles will be carried only by individuals that also carry the sterility trait. Resistance of sterile insects would be diluted by outcrossing to wild tobacco budworm, but sterile insects should remain significantly more tolerant than fertile insects for at least two generations. Use of R-TBW-BC strain could reduce costs in sterile-release programs.

Rapid assessment of the sex of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) eggs and larvae	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Lepidoptera; molecular markers; period gene; sex chromatin; sex chromosomes; sex identification	W-CHROMOSOME; CHROMATIN; DNA; PERIOD; WOLBACHIA; EVOLUTION; SILKWORM; SILKMOTH; PLANTS; GENE	Two different methods were tested to identify the sex of the early developmental stages of the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) with a WZ/ZZ (female/male) sex chromosome system. First, it was shown that the sex of all larval stages can be easily determined by the presence or absence of sex chromatin, which is formed by the female-specific W chromosome in interphase nuclei. This trait can also be used to identify the sex of newly hatched larvae but it does require care and accuracy. Secondly, a new sexing technique was developed based on a molecular marker of the codling moth W chromosome. Flanking regions of an earlier described W-specific sequence (CpW2) were isolated and sequenced and a 2.74 kb sequence (CpW2-EcoRI), specific for the W chromosome, was obtained. Several PCR tests were conducted, which confirmed that the CpW2-EcoRI sequence is a reliable marker for the sex identification in codling moth samples of different geographical origin. In addition, a fragment of a codling moth gene, period (Cpper) was isolated and sequenced. Results of southern hybridization of the Cpper probe with female and male genomic DNA suggested that the Cpper gene is located on the Z chromosome. Then a multiplex PCR assay was developed, which co-amplified the CpW2-EcoRI sequence to identify the W chromosome and the Z-linked Cpper sequence, which served as a positive control of accurate processing of tested samples. The multiplex PCR provides an easy and rapid identification of the sex of embryos and early larval instars of the codling moth.

Variability in the distribution of black cuticle and other colours was found to be much higher within populations than previously believed and it proved difficult to characterize any species, subspecies and even local population unequivocally using this feature alone. A representative sample of larvae from the Canary Islands, Madeira, North Africa, Iberia, Italy, Germany, Eastern Europe, Malta, Greece and Yemen, is illustrated, supplemented by observations from photographs of larvae from the Middle East and Western Asia. Taxonomy-independent definitions of larval morphotypes demonstrate significant overlap between species. We discuss the results in the context of Western Palaearctic biogeography, postulating several areas of hybridisation between the more northern Hyles euphorbiae and more southern H. tithymali that have led to the mosaic distribution patterns observed, and consider the potential of these moths for tracking the future effects of climate change in the Mediterranean Basin.

J	Jiggins, CD; Davies, N				Jiggins, CD; Davies, N			Genetic evidence for a sibling species of Heliconius charithonia (Lepidoptera; Nymphalidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						allopatry; butterfly; Ecuador; hybridization; hybrid zone; parapatry; Peru; speciation	BUTTERFLIES; EVOLUTION; COEVOLUTION; MIMICRY; RACES; ERATO	Heliconius charithonia is a widespread species which, unlike many Heliconius, is non-mimetic and shows little racial differentiation. Only one form, "peruvianus', which occurs in the dry forest habitats of western Ecuador and Peru: has a distinct and clearly mimetic colour pattern. Here it was shown that H. peruvianus was distinct from H. charithonia bassleri at allozyme loci (D = 0.25 over 22 loci). This differentiation was ten limes greater than that between H. charithonia sampled from Ecuador and the Caribbean (D = 0.027) and was consistent with analysis of mitochondrial sequence data (3.4-4% sequence divergence between H. peruvianus and H. charithonia). One individual with a H. peruvianus colour pattern and allozyme genotype was collected in an area where H. charithonia was known to be common, demonstrating that contact between the taxa occurs in western Ecuador Furthermore, the allozyme genotype of another individual was heterozygous for four of fi;I e diagnostic loci and was most likely an F1 hybrid between H. charithonia and H. peruvianus. These data imply that H. charithonia and H. pe,peruvianus are distinct species which hybridize occasionally. This species pair show many similarities with W. erato and H. himera, which are similarly differentiated genetically and also show ecological and colour pattern differences. These species fulfil some of the predictions of both allopatric refugium and parapatric adaptationist models of speciation in the neotropics, suggesting that elements of both hypotheses may be true.

Widespread decoupling of mtDNA variation and species integrity in Grammia tiger moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							BLAKEI GRT LEPIDOPTERA; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; GENE FLOW; HYBRIDIZATION; INTROGRESSION; POPULATION; ARCTIIDAE	We investigate the diversity of the North American tiger moth genus Grammia Rambur (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) by comparing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 'barcode' fragments of cytochrome oxidase I with non-molecular characters such as morphology, ecology, behaviour and distribution. Mitochondrial DNA genealogy is strikingly at odds with morpho-species taxonomy for most of the 28 sampled species, as haplotypic polyphyly not only is taxonomically widespread, but involves multiple shared haplotypes among two to four species. Morpho-ecological traits show that those species sharing haplotypes are often not closely related. Furthermore, high mtDNA divergences occur within species. Haplotypic variation is highly discordant with species taxonomy, but variation at a continental scale reveals significant geographic structuring of haplogroups, transcending morpho-species boundaries. A nested clade analysis and comparison of non-molecular with mtDNA data indicate that most discordance between mtDNA and taxonomy in Grammia is explained best by taxonomically and geographically widespread ongoing hybridization events resulting in mtDNA introgression. We hypothesize that broad areas of sympatry, interspecifically compatible genitalic structure, and species overlap in pheromone components facilitate hybridization, with disparate interspecies abundances promoting mitochondrial introgression. The molecular evolution of Grammia challenges the view that interspecific gene exchange occurs rarely and is restricted to recently diverged species.

FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						turfgrass pests; host plant resistance; antibiosis; Poa arachnifera; Poa pratensis; Poa hybrids	BERMUDAGRASS	The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a destructive pest of many species of both C3 and C4 (cool- and warm-season) turfgrass. No-choice experiments were conducted to evaluate 13 turfgrass genotypes of various Poa spp. for susceptibility or resistance to the fall armyworm. All 13 genotypes, including 8 Texas bluegrass (Pod arachnifera Torr.), 2 Kentucky bluegrass (P. pratensis L.) and 3 Kentucky bluegrass x Texas bluegrass interspecies hybrids, were antibiotic and produced an accumulated >80% mortality of neonate larvae before they pupated. 'Reveille' (a hybrid) provided 100% antibiosis of larvae within 4 d of feeding. When 4-d-old fall armyworm larvae that had first fed on a susceptible Poa host were confined on the same 13 Poa genotypes as in the neonate test, a much higher survival rate was recorded. 'Reveille' produced 94.4% mortality after 3 d of feeding and 100% mortality after 8 d of feeding, while TXKY90-13-16 (another hybrid) provided 100% mortality of larvae within 13 d of feeding. A third hybrid, TXKY90-13-8 was one of the more susceptible genotypes. For the 4-d-old larvae, 'Baron' and 'Delwood Fine' Kentucky bluegrass provided only 50 and 22.2%, respectively, mortality after 8 d of larval feeding and did not produce 100% mortality until pupation. Also, mortality of larvae on the 8 Texas bluegrass genotypes produced <= 45% maximum accumulated mortality by pupation or adult emergence. 'Laser' rough bluegrass (P. trivialis L.) is an excellent host with <= 5.6% larval mortality.

Females C. punctiferalis reared on castor emerged four hour (17.78 %) after lights off (ALO), those reared on cardamom emerged an hour (23.46 %) ALO. The calling frequency was more pronounced in female C. punctiferalis reared on castor compared to that on cardamom. C. punctiferalis moths reared on cardamom showed peak mating between 4 to 6 hours ALO, while 6 to 9 hours in females reared on castor. Failure of hybridization between C. punctiferalis reared on castor and cardamom suggest that the two C. punctiferalis populations segregated into two species. C. punctiferalis is a complex of species and observations, experiments, history and ecology support separation of C. punctiferalis on castor and cardamom into two.

Despite its brevicauda- like appearance, it had mt-DNA of P. polyxenes. In eastern North America the P. brevicauda (Maritime Provinces of Canada) is currently believed to reflect previous (ancient) hybridization between ancestral P. machaon and P. polyxenes. It is uncertain whether the brevicauda-like wing trait features in the odd Vermont female may be a result of some introgression of P. machaon or P. brevicauda with P. polyxenes in eastern North America as seen also in the Ozark Mountains with P. joanae. Nonetheless, the significance of wing trait analyses in relation to hybrid zones with P. polyxenes remains relevant. The segregation of wing color patterns and hostplant use abilities (efficiencies and growth rates) were examined for laboratory hand-paired F-2 hybrids of P. zelicaon x Papilio polyxenes relative to the parental species and primary hybrids. The black adult color pattern characterizing P. polyxenes is presumed to be inherited as a simple autosomal dominant. These hybrids were examined to determine: (i) how F-1 primary hybrid offspring perform relative to the parental types in survival, growth rates, and growth efficiencies; and (ii) whether these larval traits and the adult color patterns might be linked with wing morphology in the F-2 hybrids. While the F-1 hybrids grew as well as the P. polyxenes parent (P. zelicaon was significantly less efficient and slower in growth than either of these), we could not convincingly determine whether the growth performances of the F-2 segregants were linked with the parental wing patterns.

Although parthenogenesis is rare among high order animals, true parthenogens can be found in various taxa. The intriguing question of the proliferation and persistence of parthenogenetic species needs investigation. An ideal species for such research is a parthenogenetic moth Dahlica fennicella that appears to be as equally successful as other coexisting sexual species. We investigated whether high ploidy level of D. fennicella is due to hybridization between closely related sexual species. The results from flow cytometry measurements confirmed that D. fennicella is exclusively tetraploid whereas all sexual species of the genera Dahlica and Siederia are diploid. Our phylogenetic results showed the non-hybrid origin of the parthenogenetic D. fennicella in this group of Lepidoptera. Most likely, the parthenogenetic D. fennicella originated by autopolyploidization of D. lazuri, which is one of its closely related sexual species. We suggest that the apparent evolutionary success of D. fennicella might be due to polyploidy that could mask deleterious mutations and provide greater levels of genetic variation.

Molecular and morphological differences between X and Y or W and Z range from imperceptible to conspicuous. This article illustrates sex chromosome differentiation mainly in two fly species, Drosophila melanogaster and Megaselia scalaris, and in Lepidoptera. The earliest phases of XY evolution are present in the fly M, scalaris. Occasionally in this species, the male determining gene jumps to another chromosome, transforming the new host chromosome to a functional Y chromosome. Thus, in M. scalaris there are strains with virtually no XY differentiation (except for the sex determining function) and others with a moderate degree of differentiation. Base substitutions and alterations like sequence deletions, duplications, and insertions of mobile sequences mark the onset of molecular differentiation. Accumulation of molecular changes and coarser alterations are thought to lead to the morphological differences seen in WZ chromosome pairs of Lepidoptera. The W chromosome probably evolved in the most numerous clade of Lepidoptera, the Ditrysia, after it diverged from the common lepidopteran stem. Extant species display various degrees of molecular and morphological differentiation of the W chromosome, translocation or fusion with autosomes, and loss of the W.

However, because natural interbreeding capabilities are often unknown, differences in morphology are generally used to separate species. Alternatively, genetic dissimilarity is used to separate morphologically similar species. Many genetic markers, including the maternally inherited mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequence, cannot show interbreeding and therefore species status of groups may remain unresolved. In species of the genera Dahlica and Siederia (Lepidoptera: Psychidae: Naryciinae) the lack of morphological distinction and unknown interbreeding has led to unclear and unresolved taxonomic status. Mitochondrial DNA sequences suggest five sexual species to occur in Finland. However, their species status remains unconfirmed, due to a lack of knowledge on interbreeding, unclear morphological distinction and the limited variation in mitochondrial DNA. We combine three methods, a cross-mating experiment, an analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and a detailed male genital morphological examination, to establish the species status of the five suspected species. All suspected species exhibit intraspecies mating preference, although several interspecies pairs readily produce offspring. The genetic analysis, however, fails to show hybrids or introgression, suggesting that both pre- and post-copulation mechanisms isolate the species reproductively. Morphological analysis of the male genitalia confirms that the species have diverged. Our results highlight the need of combining behavioural, morphological and genetic methods to determine species status in challenging taxonomic groups.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 112, 584-605.

(Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were studied in the field and laboratory. The SWCB infests maize in the high latitude and mid-altitude areas and SCB infests maize in the lowland tropical areas in Mexico. The hybrids tested were Ki3 x CML131, CML67 x 135 and CML139 x 135, and the inbreds tested were Ki3, CML67, CML131, CML135 and CML139. Nonpreference and/or antibiosis were the mechanisms of resistance expressed by the hybrids CML67 x 135 and CML139 x 135 grown in the fields as indicated by the low leaf feeding damage, low larval survival of the two species. The resistance in the two resistant hybrids evidently came from the resistant inbreds CML67 and CML139 because the parameters measured for non-preference and antibiosis were also very low in these resistant inbreds in comparison to CML131, Ki3 and CML135. Laboratory studies also indicated that feeding non-preference and/or antibiosis was the first line of defence in the resistant hybrids (CML67 x 135 and CML139 x 135) and inbreds (CMLG7 and 139) against the attack of stem borers. The survival and growth of the larvae were then adversely affected because of antibiosis in resistant plants to two species of borers. Because of non-preference and antibiosis mechanisms of resistance, the hybrids CML67 x 135 and CML139 x 135 suffered little from leaf and stalk damage, and thus lost little grain yield (3-4%) in comparison to the susceptible hybrid Ki3 x CML131 (35-40%) under heavy infestation by the SWCB and SCB in the fields. These resistant hybrids can be readily used in the integrated pest management (IPM) programs under subsistance farming conditions in the subtropical and tropical environments to reduce yield reductions and increase food production, if grain color, texture, taste and grain quality are acceptable.

This prediction was tested using two host races of Mitoura butterflies. Thirtyfive F-1 hybrid and parental lines were created, larvae were raised on the two host plants, and oviposition preferences were assayed in choice arenas. Larvae from both reciprocal hybrid crosses suffered a host-specific reduction in performance: when reared on incense cedar, hybrid survival was approximately 30% less than the survival of pure lines of the cedar-associated host race. The performance of hybrid larvae reared on the other host, MacNab cypress, was not reduced relative to parental genotypes. Females from both reciprocal hybrid crosses preferred to oviposit on incense cedar, the same host that resulted in the reduced survival of hybrid larvae. Thus, dominance is implicated in the inheritance of traits involved in both preference and performance, which do not appear to be genetically linked in Mitoura butterflies. Gene flow between host races may be reduced because the correlation between preference and performance that was previously described in parental populations is essentially broken by hybridization.

The concentration of Z9-14:Ac found in the glands of hybrid females, coming from corn x rice and rice x corn crosses differed significantly, but in both cases did not differ significantly from that of maternal line females. The results suggest that synthesis is controlled, at least in part, by the W chromosome. Given the intraspecific variability reported in other species of Lepidoptera, both with respect to female pheromone production and male responsiveness, it would appear rather unlikely that these differences alone would be sufficient to ensure reproductive isolation of the two strains.

We studied their evolutionary relationships using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 49 specimens in 18 populations of the A. franciscana group, as well as 2 outgroup species. Most specimens were sequenced over a 799-bp segment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Single specimens each of A. franciscana insulana Powell and A. citrana (Fernald) were sequenced over a 2.3-kb region including COI, tRNA leucine (UUR), and cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII), mtDNA variation within and among Argyrotaenia citrana, A. franciscana (Walsingham), and A. franciscana insulana is most simply interpreted as DNA polymorphism within a single species for which the oldest name is A. franciscana. Maximal divergence among haplotypes was 3.8%, which is on the high end of the range for intraspecific mtDNA variation in Lepidoptera. Argyrotaenia niscana (Kearfott) is most closely related to a new species, and this pair forms the closest outgroup to the A. franciscana-citrana complex. The status of A. isolatissima Powell remains uncertain.

Retroviruses can be engineered to be replication defective and to serve as vectors for gene constructs of interest. In this study, pseudotyped MoMLV(VSV-C) retroviral vectors are shown to successfully infect lepidopteran cells in vitro and in vivo. In Spodoptera frugiperda cells in vitro and in Manduca sexta in vivo, infection and conversion to proviral DNA were confirmed by PCR amplification and Southern blot hybridization of vector-specific sequences. Gene expression and integration of proviral DNA were also documented in vitro. This is the first report of retroviral infection in lepidoptera and suggests that pseudotyped retroviral vectors could be powerful tools in gene manipulation studies of non-drosophilid insects.

All 16 markers displayed a high degree of variation in both species, ranging from eight to 24 alleles per locus. Substantial heterozygote deficits were observed for several loci, indicating the presence of null alleles. All markers were successfully used to genotype dried samples from a historical collection. Cross-species amplification with six additional Papilio species showed that most loci can be used to study genetic variation in other closely related species of tiger swallowtails.

Utility of microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA for species delimitation in the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) species complex (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Choristoneura; Hybridization; Incomplete lineage sorting; Neutral markers; Species identification; Spruce budworm; Adaptive traits	JACK PINE BUDWORM; RETINIANA LEPIDOPTERA; PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE; PHEROMONE COMPONENTS; LEDERER LEPIDOPTERA; GENETIC-VARIATION; NORTH-AMERICA; POPULATIONS; OCCIDENTALIS; IDENTIFICATION	Species identifications have been historically difficult in the Choristoneura fumiferana group, an important insect pest complex. We examined the utility of simple sequence repeats (SSRs, also referred to as microsatellites) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for delimiting and identifying eight currently recognized species sampled across North America. Four of these species formed discrete clusters using SSRs, while only two species were delimited with mtDNA. There was evidence for hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting between several species pairs. An integrative approach, using both phenotypic traits and molecular markers, allowed for the discrimination of more biologically relevant species units than did the use of molecular markers alone. As species are currently identified using putatively adaptive phenotypic traits, the differences observed between recognized species and neutral SSRs or mtDNA suggests that these species (or evolutionary significant units) have diverged via natural selection in spite of some gene flow.

Pre- and postzygotic isolation and Haldane rule effects in reciprocal crosses of Danaus erippus and Danaus plexippus (Lepidoptera : Danainae), supported by differentiation of cuticular hydrocarbons, establish their status as separate species	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						cuticular hydrocarbons; Danaus plexippus nigrippus; gas chromatography; hybridization; monarch butterflies; Peru; prezygotic isolation; postzygotic isolation	MILKWEED BUTTERFLIES LEPIDOPTERA; HYBRID STERILITY; DOMINANCE; LIPIDS; CLASSIFICATION; GENETICS; ORIGIN	Hybridization experiments and cuticular hydrocarbon analyses were performed to determine the extent of the reproductive isolation present to clarify the taxonomic status of Danaus erippus (Cramer, 1775), which has often been classified as a subspecies of Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus, 1758). The results of crosses between D. erippus and Danaus plexippus nigrippus (Haensch, 1909) showed pre- and postzygotic isolation. Pupal inviability, and Haldane rule effects (male hybrids only, the homogametic sex in butterflies) were observed after the crosses. These results reinforce the hypothesis that D. plexippus and D. erippus are separate, reproductively isolated species. However, we have also investigated the cuticular hydrocarbons in D. erippus and D. p. nigrippus with temperature-programmed gas chromatography. The chromatographic profiles of peaks were similar in both taxa, with retention indices in the range 2100-3797. The profiles were characterized by the presence of 15 peaks whose retention indices were in the range 2501-3772. Although no major qualitative differences between the two species were observed, we did find some quantitative differences. A principal component analysis showed a clear separation between members of D. erippus and D. p. nigrippus, suggesting that semiochemical differences might have become differentiated after isolation, perhaps in response to different physiological pressures.

We studied phylogenetic relationships, biogeography, and systematics based on genetic - nuclear and mitochondrial - and morphometric - external (wings) and internal (genitalia) data. We show that Aricia is a monophyletic genus comprising the taxa Pseudoaricia, Ultraaricia and Umpria, which are here considered junior synonyms of Aricia. The taxa allous, inhonora, issekutzi, mandzhuriana, myrmecias and transalaica, which have often been raised to species rank, are shown to probably represent subspecies or synonyms. We show that montensis is likely a good species that is sister to all A. artaxerxes populations across the Palearctic region. The species A. anteros and A. morronensis are shown to display deep intraspecific divergences and they may harbor cryptic species. We also discovered that A. cramera and A. agestis exhibit a pattern of mutual exclusion on islands, and a parapatric distribution in mainland with a narrow contact zone where potential hybrids were detected. The lack of a prezygotic barrier that prevents their coexistence could explain this phenomenon. This study will hopefully contribute to the stability of the systematics of Aricia, a group with potential for the study of the link between speciation and biogeography. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we reported its complete mitochondrial genome sequence for the first time. The 15,680 bp long genome contains 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes [PCGs], 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes) and 1 major non-coding A + T-rich region, with the typical arrangement found in Lepidoptera. All PCGs started with typical ATN codons except for COI, which began with CGA. Eleven PCGs have complete stop codons, whereas COI and COII end with a single T. The 495 bp long A + T-rich region harbors the conserved sequence features typically found in lepidopteran insects. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Qiufeng x Baiyu provides an important data source for further study on the mechanism of silkworm domestication.

Genetic structure, admixture and invasion success in a Holarctic defoliator, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar, Lepidoptera: Erebidae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						global phylogeography; hybridization; invasion success; microsatellite; mitochondrial DNA; Pleistocene glaciation	RANGE EXPANSION; DNA VARIATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; PROGRAM; POPULATIONS; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	Characterizing the current population structure of potentially invasive species provides a critical context for identifying source populations and for understanding why invasions are successful. Non-native populations inevitably lose genetic diversity during initial colonization events, but subsequent admixture among independently introduced lineages may increase both genetic variation and adaptive potential. Here we characterize the population structure of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar Linnaeus), one of the world's most destructive forest pests. Native to Eurasia and recently introduced to North America, the current distribution of gypsy moth includes forests throughout the temperate region of the northern hemisphere. Analyses of microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences for 1738 individuals identified four genetic clusters within L.dispar. Three of these clusters correspond to the three named subspecies; North American populations represent a distinct fourth cluster, presumably a consequence of the population bottleneck and allele frequency change that accompanied introduction. We find no evidence that admixture has been an important catalyst of the successful invasion and range expansion in North America. However, we do find evidence of ongoing hybridization between subspecies and increased genetic variation in gypsy moth populations from Eastern Asia, populations that now pose a threat of further human-mediated introductions. Finally, we show that current patterns of variation can be explained in terms of climate and habitat changes during the Pleistocene, a time when temperate forests expanded and contracted. Deeply diverged matrilines in Europe imply that gypsy moths have been there for a long time and are not recent arrivals from Asia.

(Solanaceae) are resistant to potato tuber worm (PTW), Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), infestation compared to those of the popular commercial North American cultivars Allegany, Atlantic, Chieftain, Katahdin, MaineChip, NorDonna, Norwis, Russet Norkotah, Snowden, and Yukon Gold. Given a choice between Atlantic and hybrid tubers, female PTW deposited ca. 50% fewer eggs on hybrid tubers than on those of Atlantic; larval survival and production of prepupae on hybrid tubers were reduced similarly. Time needed for neonates to penetrate eye buds was ca. 100 min greater on hybrid tubers compared to that on cv. Atlantic. Periderm of hybrid tubers is thicker than that of cv. Atlantic and may contribute to the delay in larval penetration of tubers and the success of initial establishment.

In laboratory conditions they hybridize, and Fl, F2 and backcross hybrids may be obtained easily. Some interspecific matings do not succeed due to anatomical incompatibilities resulting from morphological differences in the genitalia of the species. One of these differences involves the clasper, a highly sclerotized process of the male genitalia. The overall contour of the clasper in S. descoinsi, S. latifascia, Fl, F2, and backcross hybrids was analysed using elliptic Fourier analysis. All outlines were rotated along a common direction defined by two homologous landmarks, centered, and normalized for size. Fourier descriptors were used in a canonical variate analysis. Shape variations along factorial axes, or more generally along any variate of interest, such as size, were modelized by a multivariate regressive approach and visualized by inverse Fourier reconstructions of shapes. This approach allows a direct visualization of the shape transformations, negating the so-called impossibility or difficulty to interpret results of Fourier analyses. The results emphasize the specificity of the male clasper in the parental species. Most hybrids and backcrosses segregate from their parents. Many of them are displaced towards one of the parental forms. These results suggest that morphological differences may be controlled by a polygenic system with maternal effect in Fl and parental dominance in backcross hybrids.

More evidence for an admixture of the Hyles euphorbiae complex's main lineages in Mediterranean Europe ( Lepidoptera: Sphingidae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Lepidoptera; Sphingidae; Hyles euphorbiae complex; Hyles cretica; historical DNA; mtDNA; biogeography; island endemic; Aegean Islands; hybridization; introgression	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY	The populations of the Hyles euphorbiae complex on Crete and the Dodecanese Islands have been described as an endemic species, Hyles "cretica". Alternatively, they are thought to be of hybrid origin from the complex's two main lineages, the European H. euphorbiae and African H. tithymali, because of their intermediate morphology. That they belong to a discrete taxon is supported by the fact that all the recent samples analyzed belong to an endemic mitochondrial haplotype cluster; however, this cluster is so close to the tithymali cluster that it might also be regarded as a sublineage of H. tithymali. Similarly, southern Italy is currently dominated by another distinct tithymali-related cluster, named "italica". However, sequencing of historic museum specimens, which were collected in Italy during the past century, revealed that mitochondrial haplotypes of H. euphorbiae were once present throughout the entire range of "italica" thus contradicting a long-term isolated evolution of a southern Italian refugial entity. In the present study we likewise sequenced the few available historic specimens from the Aegean Islands and also found a specimen from Crete which belonged to the euphorbiae cluster. In conclusion, southern Italian and southern Aegean populations both appear to be dynamic hybrid mixtures of the European H. euphorbiae and African H. tithymali, rather than separately evolved taxa.

Reproductive Isolation Between Two Populations of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Collected in Corn and Rice Fields From Central Colombia	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						fitness; reproductive isolation; host plant association; Spodoptera frugiperda; strains	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS HUBNER; SEX-LINKED DIAPAUSE; HOST-PLANT RACES; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; CHORTHIPPUS-BRUNNEUS; JACOBSI ORTHOPTERA; PAPILIO-GLAUCUS; STRAINS; SPECIATION	Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a Neotropical moth that has diverged into corn, Zea mays L., and rice, Oryza sativa L., host strains because these plants are their most frequently used hosts. The corn strain also has been found in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, and the rice strain in small grasses and pasture grasses. Studies of the reproductive isolation between these two strains have provided ambiguous results from populations in the United States. In Colombia, we tested pre- and postzygotic isolation in these strains. Both strains showed postzygotic isolation for several life-history traits, including number of egg masses, number of larvae, number of females, pupal developmental time, female and male longevity, and female and male pupal weight. We observed a reduction of the number of hybrid females and a reduction in fertility in hybrids in S. frugiperda. These results suggest the possibility of Haldane's rule. Heterosis in the F 1(2) and F 2(1) generations was observed for number of larvae and adult longevity. This line presented a high standard deviation, suggesting instability in this cross. A possible effect of the X chromosome may explain the reduction in viability and sterility in F1 hybrids of host strains of S. frugiperda. No temporal isolation was observed between the corn and rice strains. Differences in longevity between corn and rice strains might be another form of temporal isolation between these strains, because differences in adulthood time might reduce the encounters between them and thus hybridization.

Both are commercially available for biological control and are important parasitoids of the eggs of Lepidoptera in agricultural ecosystems. Results are reported of an extensive survey of reproductive compatibility and allozymes at the phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) locus in collections representing 85 localities throughout much of the geographical range of this species complex. In total, 103 reproductive crosses were performed and 161 collections were analyzed electrophoretically. Results support the recognition of T minutum and T platneri as distinct species. The two are distinguishable electrophoretically at the Pgm locus. High levels of reproductive incompatibility are correlated with the allozymic differences. Although T platneri is western in distribution (W of 115degrees longitude) and T minutum is primarily eastern, the two are sympatric in the Pacific Northwest. A low level of interspecific hybridization in laboratory studies notwithstanding, there is no evidence that introgression occurs in the zone of sympatry. This study continues to stress the importance of species recognition and the inadvisability of using T minutum and T platneri interchangeably in biological control. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Geometric morphometrics reveal male genitalia differences in the Lasiommata megera/paramegaera complex (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) and the lack of a predicted hybridization area in the Tuscan Archipelago	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Lasiommata; genitalia morphology; island populations; Tyrrhenian area	RECENT GEOGRAPHY; BUTTERFLIES; PALEOGEOGRAPHY; COLONIZATION; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; DELIMITATION; REVOLUTION; NOCTUIDAE; DIVERSITY	The recognition of specific demarcation between allopatric populations, as for island endemics, is particularly difficult according to the Biological Concept of Species. However, the recognition of the specific status of island taxa is decisive in evaluating important areas of endemism for conservation purposes. The recent taxonomic inflation of European butterfly species calls into question the validity and objectivity of taxonomic practices, and of databases dependent on them, which are used in biogeography and conservation. In this paper I applied rigorous morphometric analyses instead of visual evaluation to solve the long debated question of whether Lasiommata paramegaera butterfly from Sardinia and Corsica should be considered as a separated entity from the widespread Lasiommata megera. First, I carried out analyses of male genitalia shape comparing the populations from Corsica and Tuscany. Thereafter, I also searched for possible hybridization evidence in the sole area where it is strongly predicted: the Tuscan Archipelago. These islands are located between Tuscany and Corsica and there is large evidence of a continuous immigration of butterflies from these two main sources. I found that Corsican L. paramegaera and Tuscan L. megera can be clearly distinguished on the basis of genitalia shape. Furthermore, the Lasiommata population of each islet clearly maintains the characteristics of one of the two species without evidence of intermediate individuals. In conclusion, I suggest that the two entities should be considered as separate species maintaining their homogeneity by a reduced gene flow across sea, mating avoidance and/or by some depletion of F1 hybrids in developmental or mating success.

Taxonomy and nomenclature of this genus are not entirely established, and there are many species with a controversial taxonomic position. We present a comparative evolutionary analysis of the most economically important Dendrolimus species in Eurasia. Results: Our analysis was based on the nucleotide sequences of COI and COII mitochondrial genes and ITS2 spacer of nuclear ribosomal genes. All known sequences were extracted from GenBank. Additional 112 new sequences were identified for 28 specimens of D. sibiricus, D. pini, and D. superans from five regions of Siberia and the Russian Far East to be able to compare the disparate data from all previous studies. In total, 528 sequences were used in phylogenetic analysis. Two clusters of closely related species in Dendrolimus were found. The first cluster includes D. pini, D. sibiricus, and D. superans; and the second, D. spectabilis, D. punctatus, and D. tabulaeformis. Species D. houi and D. kikuchii appear to be the most basal in the genus. Conclusion: Genetic difference among the second cluster species is very low in contrast to the first cluster species. Phylogenetic position D. tabulaeformis as a subspecies was supported. It was found that D. sibiricus recently separated from D. superans. Integration of D. sibiricus mitochondrial DNA sequences and the spread of this species to the west of Eurasia have been established as the cause of the unjustified allocation of a new species: D. kilmez. Our study further clarifies taxonomic problems in the genus and gives more complete information on the genetic structure of D. pini, D. sibiricus, and D. superans.

Testing DNA Barcode Performance in 1000 Species of European Lepidoptera: Large Geographic Distances Have Small Genetic Impacts	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BUTTERFLIES; WOLBACHIA; LIBRARY; FAUNA	This study examines the performance of DNA barcodes (mt cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene) in the identification of 1004 species of Lepidoptera shared by two localities (Finland, Austria) that are 1600 km apart. Maximum intraspecific distances for the pooled data were less than 2% for 880 species (87.6%), while deeper divergence was detected in 124 species. Despite such variation, the overall DNA barcode library possessed diagnostic COI sequences for 98.8% of the taxa. Because a reference library based on Finnish specimens was highly effective in identifying specimens from Austria, we conclude that barcode libraries based on regional sampling can often be effective for a much larger area. Moreover, dispersal ability (poor, good) and distribution patterns (disjunct, fragmented, continuous, migratory) had little impact on levels of intraspecific geographic divergence. Furthermore, the present study revealed that, despite the intensity of past taxonomic work on European Lepidoptera, nearly 20% of the species shared by Austria and Finland require further work to clarify their status. Particularly discordant BIN (Barcode Index Number) cases should be checked to ascertain possible explanatory factors such as incorrect taxonomy, hybridization, introgression, and Wolbachia infections.

In comparison with IR31917-45-3-2, O. brachyantha and the F1 hybrid were unsuitable for oviposition, survival, and growth of C. medinalis. However, growth and survival of larvae in artificial diets containing lyophilized leaf powder of IR31917-45-3-2 and O. brachyantha were comparable. Studies on the feeding and settling preference of the larval stage suggested that the mechanism of resistance of O. brachyantha is that of antixenosis type. Olfactometer tests with first-instar larvae and electroantennogram responses of adults indicated a lack or low levels of volatile attractants in O. brachyantha and the F1 hybrid in comparison with IR31917-45-3-2. Bioassays of sequential solvent extracts of these plants indicated that larval preference for IR31917-45-3-2 and nonpreference for O. brachyantha and the F1 hybrid were due partly to chemical factors present in hexane and methylene chloride extractables. Closer arrangement of silica cells in the epidermal layer of O. brachyantha and a higher mandibular wear in larvae reared on O. brachyantha suggested that physical resistance due to silica may be an additional cause of resistance. It was hypothesized that the high levels of resistance observed in O. brachyantha may be due to an additive or synergistic action of the absence of attractants or feeding stimulants, the presence of deterrents, and the physical resistance offered by silica. The significance of these results to a successful wide hybridization program aimed at transferring resistance factors from wild rice to cultivated rice is discussed.

In recent years, much effort has also been devoted to developing corn hybrids with genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that encode insecticidal proteins. Some of these hybrids have exhibited moderate resistance to fall armyworm damage. In this investigation hybrids with both native genetic resistance and genes from Bt encoding insecticidal proteins were evaluated for resistance to fall armyworm in field tests and laboratory bioassays. Hybrids with both types of resistance sustained less fall armyworm damage than hybrids that had only native genetic resistance or genes from Bt encoding insecticidal proteins alone. Larvae that fed on hybrids with both types of resistance were significantly smaller after feeding on plants in the field or on lyophilized whorl leaf tissue in a laboratory bioassay for 10 d than larvae fed on susceptible hybrids or hybrids with only one type of resistance. Both traditional host plant resistance and transformation of corn with genes from Br provide hybrids with moderate levels of resistance, but when used together, they are complementary. Deployment of hybrids with both types of resistance should reduce losses to fall armyworm and also reduce the rate of buildups of resistance to Bt in fall armyworm populations.

E. Smith), to assess their ability to distinguish 2 host-associated strains. Cluster analyses of variation at 10 AFLP loci amplified with 5 primer pairs revealed 2 groups. Each group contained a majority of individuals from 1 or the other host-associated strain as defined by habitat and mtDNA type. Discordance between habitat/mtDNA strain assignments and AFLPs occurred more frequently in the rice strain (8%) than in the corn strain (3%), and at a frequency of 5% overall. Results indicate that AFLPs exhibit strain-specific variation comparable to that of mtDNA and allozymes. In combination with other markers, AFLP loci will be useful for developing a system for identification of fall armyworm strains and hybrids.

Genetic differentiation and natural hybridization between the Sardinian endemic Maniola nurag and the European Maniola jurtina	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						allozymes; biogeography; endemism; Lepidoptera; morphometrics; phylogeography; population genetics	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HYBRID ZONES; BUTTERFLIES LEPIDOPTERA; MOLECULAR BIOGEOGRAPHY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; PODARCIS-TILIGUERTA; F-STATISTICS; EVOLUTION; LYCAENIDAE; SPECIATION	The Mediterranean island of Sardinia is known for its multitude of unique genetic lineages. We view one of them in a larger phylogeographic context. The endemic Sardinian Meadow Brown butterfly, Maniola nurag, is restricted to the mountainous areas of the island, whereas its widespread close relative, Maniola jurtina, also occurs on the coast. At intermediate altitudes the species' distributions overlap. There, a number of individuals exhibit phenotypic characteristics intermediate between the two species. We examined patterns of intra- and interpopulation variation in 10 M. nurag populations from Sardinia and 16 M. jurtina populations from Sardinia and continental Europe, as well as 17 intermediate individuals, sampled in 1999-2002, by means of allozyme markers, combining it with a morphometric analysis based on 18 wing-characters of 52 males. At the 15 loci studied (aldolase, aat-1, aat-2, g6pdh, gpd, idh-1, idh-2, mdh-1, mdh-2, mpi, me, leu-ala, pgi, pgm, and 6pgdh), 76 different alleles were detected, 63 of which were shared by M. nurag and M. jurtina. None of the loci was found to be alternatively fixed between the two species. In that respect, this study testifies to the difficulties that may arise when trying to identify hybrids from genotypic data. Levels of genetic variation in island populations (M. jurtina: H-o = 0.137-0.189; M. nurag: Ho = 0.141-0.270) were comparable to those of mainland M. jurtina (110 = 0.141-0.236). A Bayesian admixture analysis supported the hypothesis of mixed (hybrid) ancestry of individuals occurring at intermediate altitudes. Similarly, neighbour-joining and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) analyses, as well as morphometrics hinted at the existence of a Maniola-hybrid zone in Sardinia at intermediate altitudes. We discuss the results in the light of the phylogeography of other Sardinian taxa with the aim to reach a general understanding of the biogeographic history of this island's endemic species.

J	KAROWE, DN				KAROWE, DN			DIAPAUSE DYNAMICS AMD HOST-PLANT UTILIZATION OF COLIAS-PHILODICE, COLIAS-INTERIOR AND THEIR HYBRIDS (LEPIDOPTERA, PIERIDAE)	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article								Abnormal diapause dynamics and, to a lesser extent, reduced efficiency of host utilization by hybrid larvae constitute potential post-zygotic barriers to gene flow between a multivoltine legume-feeder, Colias philodice (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) and a univoltine Vaccinium-feeder, C. interior. At the time when C. interior larvae enter diapause, approximately 50% of hybrid larvae ceased feeding but did not enter diapause, and subsequently starved. Hybrid larvae readily accepted the host plants of both parental species. However, relative to C. philodice, hybrid larvae displayed a significantly reduced fifth instar relative growth rate (RGR) when fed the primary legume host, Medicago sativa. Reduced growth of hybrid larvae was attributable to both reduced relative consumption rate (RCR) and reduced efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD), but not to reduced digestive efficiency (AD). Relative to C. interior, hybrid larvae fed Vaccinium myrtilloides displayed reduced pupal weight and reduced ECD. These results may explain in part why all known naturally-occurring hybrids among North American Colias arise from parental species with similar host plant ranges and diapause strategies.

Polyphagous stages of evolutionary lineages may represent transitional states in which novel host associations are more likely to develop, but may be more difficult to detect experimentally. The polyphagous sister species Papilio glaucus L. and Papilio canadensis (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae; these Papilio = Pterourus) are known to exhibit differences in host-plant use, despite significant overlap in host-use abilities, providing an opportunity to examine how host shifts in polyphagous species may occur and what the implications for future divergence may be. In particular, we were interested in (i) determining whether differences in oviposition behavior of these species were due to changes in specificity or shifts in host-plant hierarchy, (ii) whether the varying preference for primary hosts also affected the preference for secondary hosts, and (iii) what the oviposition preferences of a new hybrid swarm population are. We examined more than 40 000 oviposition bouts from more than 400 P. glaucus, P. canadensis, and hybrid females placed in seven-, three-, or two-choice assays. In each of the choice assays, leaves from plants in different plant families of varying suitability for P. glaucus and P. canadensis larvae were used. We found the primary difference between P. glaucus and P. canadensis to be limited to a Z-linked shift in host rank hierarchy due to an acceptance of Populus tremuloides Michx. (Salicaceae) and reduced specificity for Liriodendron tulipifera L. (Magnoliaceae) in P. canadensis. In addition, we found the absence of the Z-linked oviposition acceptance of P. tremuloides in a recently formed allochronically separated hybrid swarm population found in P. canadensis territory at the northern border of the P. glaucus and P. canadensis hybrid zone.

Food Plant Shifts Drive the Diversification of Sack-Bearer Moths	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						anchored hybrid enrichment; comparative phylogenomics; Lepidoptera; tropical Americas	PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD; DIVERGENCE TIMES; MASS EXTINCTION; MODEL SELECTION; R PACKAGE; PHYLOGENY; RADIATION; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	Lepidoptera are a highly diverse group of herbivorous insects; however, some superfamilies have relatively few species. Two alternative hypotheses for drivers of Lepidoptera diversity are shifts in food plant use or shifts from concealed to external feeding as larvae. Many studies address the former hypothesis but with bias toward externally feeding taxa. One of the most striking examples of species disparity between sister lineages in Lepidoptera is between the concealed-feeding sack-bearer moths (Mimallonoidea), which contain about 300 species, and externally feeding Macroheterocera, which have over 74,000 species. We provide the first dated tree of Mimallonidae to understand the diversification dynamics of these moths in order to fill a knowledge gap pertaining to drivers of diversity within an important concealed-feeding clade. We find that Mimallonidae is an ancient Lepidoptera lineage that originated in the Cretaceous similar to 105 million years ago and has had a close association with the plant order Myrtales for the past 40 million years. Diversification dynamics are tightly linked with food plant usage in this group. Reliance on Myrtales may have influenced diversification of Mimallonidae because clades that shifted away from the ancestral condition of feeding on Myrtales have the highest speciation rates in the family.

J	Monti, L; Genermont, J; Malosse, C; LalanneCassou, B				Monti, L; Genermont, J; Malosse, C; LalanneCassou, B			A genetic analysis of some components of reproductive isolation between two closely related species, Spodoptera latifascia (Walker) and S-descoinsi (Lalanne-Cassou and Silvain) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						genetics; sex pheromone; Lepidoptera; Noctuidae; reproductive isolation	SPECIATION	The two closely related noctuid moths Spodoptera latifascia and S. descoinsi have been found in sympatry in some parts of French Guiana. They differ by i) ecological preferences? ii) some anatomical features of the genital tract, iii) the relative amounts of the two main components of the female pheromonal blend, and iv) the temporal pattern of sexual behaviour. Viable and fertile interspecific hybrids can be obtained in the laboratory, thus permitting a genetic study of some of these traits. The anatomical differences cause perturbations in mating efficiency. Experimental results show that these differences are hereditarily transmitted, but their exact mode of inheritance remains unknown. The timing of initiation of female calling activity is very likely to be under polygenic control. Conclusive evidence showed that a pair of major autosomal alleles determined the pheromone composition. Moreover, some of the data suggest that the descoinsi allele would become lethal in certain mosaic latifascia/descoinsi genomic environments. The ecological factor is likely to be the major component of reproductive isolation between the two species in natural conditions. However in contact zones, the differences in pheromone composition and in timing of sexual activity are probably involved in preventing interspecific hybridization. Two speciation scenarios are proposed, both sympatric. In one of them, the primary event would be a fragmentation of the tropical forest followed by disruptive selection associated with habitat diversification. In the other, the speciation process might have been initiated by the occurrence of mutations acting on the pheromone mediated mate recognition system.

Genetic independence of female signal form and male receiver design in the almond moth, Cadra cautella	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						genetic correlation; Lepidoptera; pheromone; sexual selection; signal	CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM; EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ARTIFICIAL SELECTION; SEXUAL SELECTION; MATE RECOGNITION; PHEROMONE; PREFERENCE; CHOICE; SPECIATION	Efficient signalling requires coordination of signal form and receiver design. To maintain signal function, parallel changes in signaller and receiver traits are required. Genetic correlation and co-evolution among signal and response traits have been proposed to preserve signal function (i.e. coordination) during the evolution of mate recognition systems. Empirical studies have provided support for both mechanisms; however, there is debate regarding the interpretation of some of these studies. Tests for a genetic correlation typically hybridize divergent signalling systems and look at hybrid signal form and receiver design, or impose artificial selection on signal form and look for an indirect response to selection in receiver design. Some of the hybridization studies did not achieve reassortment of genes from the parental types, whereas some of the artificial selection studies incorporated random mating in their designs. As a result of these limitations, the hybridization studies cannot discriminate between genetic correlation and co-evolution with primarily additive genetic effects underlying signal and response traits. Similarly, the artificial selection experiments cannot discriminate between genetic correlation because of linkage disequilibrium and co-evolution. This study examined the mating preferences of male almond moths, Cadra cautella, before and after female moths were artificially selected (using a design incorporating assortative mating) for novel pheromone blend ratios. Our results demonstrate the absence of a genetic correlation between signal and response traits in the almond moth.	[Allison, J. D.; Carde, R.

This nematode was obtained from soil samples by the insect-baiting technique using last instar larvae of Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Steinernema changbaiense sp. n. is closely related to species in the 'feltiae-kraussei-oregonense' group. It is characterised by morphometrics of the infective juvenile (IJ) with a body length of 757 (730-790) mu m, distance from head to excretory pore of 61 (58-68) mu m, tail length of 77 (71-85) mu m, E % = 80 (73-88), and a lateral field pattern 2, 5, 6, 4, 2. The male of the first generation can be recognised by a spicule of 63 (56-70) mu m long and a gubernaculum of 40 (33-46) mu m long; the spicule is slender, the velum short. The first generation female has a symmetrical, slightly protruding vulva and a ratio D (%) of 49 (35-55). The new species differs distinctly from related species such as S. ashiunense, S. robustispiculum and S. monticolum by a different number of ridges in the lateral fields and the distance from the head to excretory pore of the IJ, and the body length, morphology of spicules and gubernaculum of the male. Cross hybridisation tests showed that these species are reproductively isolated. The sequences analyses of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of rDNA and D2-D3 domain of the LSU regions confirmed the new species identity.

Heterogeneous accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities, degree of dominance, and implications for Haldane's rule	EVOLUTION			English	Article						genomic conflict; hybrid female sterility; hybrid lethality; hybrid male sterility; meiotic drive; sex ratio; speciation	CONSPECIFIC SPERM PRECEDENCE; REPRODUCTIVE-TRACT PROTEINS; MEIOTIC-DRIVE MODELS; SEX-RATIO; SEGREGATION DISTORTION; UNISEXUAL STERILITY; EVOLUTION; CHROMOSOMES; DIVERGENCE; MELANOGASTER	The genetic basis of Haldane's rule was investigated through estimating the accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities between Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana by means of introgression. The accumulation of hybrid male sterility (HMS) is at least 10 times greater than that of hybrid female sterility (HFS) or hybrid lethality (HL). The degree of dominance for HMS and HL in a pure D. simulans background is estimated as 0.23-0.29 and 0.33-0.39, respectively; that for HL in an F-1 background is unlikely to be very small. Evidence obtained here was used to test the Turelli-Orr model of Haldane's rule. Composite causes, especially, faster-male evolution and recessive hybrid incompatibilities, underlie Haldane's rule in heterogametic male taxa such as Drosophila (XY male and XX female). However, if faster-male evolution is driven by sexual selection, it contradicts Haldane's rule for sterility in heterogametic-female taxa such as Lepidoptera (ZW female and ZZ male). The hypothesis of a faster-heterogametic-sex evolution seems to fit the current data best. This hypothesis states that gametogenesis in the heterogametic sex, instead of in males per se, evolves much faster than in the homogametic sex, in part because of sex-ratio selection.

Restriction endonuclease digestion-gel electrophoresis of this virus, using a number of different endonucleases and whole CrMNPV genome Southern hybridization, have shown it to be different but similar to the equivalent virus from the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (CfMNPV). The polyhedrin gene of CrMNPV has been isolated, cloned, and sequenced and shown to have a predicted amino acid sequence only two amino acids different from the CfMNPV polyhedrin. In bioassays against spruce budworm larvae, CrMNPV had little pathogenicity to that host. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

Operophtera occidentalis (Hulst) is now treated as a subspecies of a bruceata. All species are illustrated and characters to distinguish the species are given. The most useful characters for separating O. brumata from O. bruceata include the following: (1) hindwing dorsal surface with discal dot, which is almost always visible on O. bruceata but absent from O. brumata; (2) forewing colour, which is grey-brown or light brown in O. bruceata but reddish-brown in O. brumata; (3) abdomen colour, which is golden-brown to brown in western O. bruceata but brown in O. brumata; and (4) the costa of the forewing ventral surface, which is usually golden-brown in O. bruceata but brown in O. brumata. The structure of the genitalia of these two species allows hybridization between O. bruceata males and O. brumata females, but not vice versa. Hypothesized species interrelationships between palaearctic and nearctic Operophtera are illustrated in a cladogram. Maps for the distribution of each species are also included.

Aflatoxin accumulation in corn hybrids infested at different growth stages with southwestern corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						aflatoxin; Aspergillus flavus; Diatraea grandiosella; Lepidoptera; Crambidae; Zea mays; host plant resistance	GERMPLASM LINE; FALL ARMYWORM; MAIZE; REGISTRATION; INFESTATION; DAMAGE; MYCOTOXINS; PYRALIDAE; LARVAE	Aflatoxin is a potent toxin produced by the fungus Aspergillus flavus. Contamination of corn, Zea mays L., with aflatoxin greatly reduces the value of corn grain and is a major impediment to profitable corn production in the South. Infestation of developing corn ears with southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidopera: Crambidae), increases the likelihood of aflatoxin contamination. In this investigation, six corn hybrids with different levels of resistance to southwestern corn borer damage and aflatoxin contamination were evaluated for damage by southwestern corn borer and aflatoxin contamination after infestation with southwestern corn borer at 7-d intervals from 35-84 d after planting and inoculation with an A. flavus conidial suspension. Transgenic (130 hybrids exhibited excellent resistance to Southwestern corn borer and less aflatoxin contamination than conventional versions of the same hybrids. A conventional hybrid with intermediate resistance to southwestern corn borer also exhibited relatively low levels of aflatoxin contamination. A conventional hybrid selected for resistance to aflatoxin contamination was heavily damaged by southwestern corn borer, but exhibited little aflatoxin contamination. Hybrids that have resistance to both southwestern corn borer and aflatoxin contamination appear to have the greatest potential for effectively reducing losses to aflatoxin in the South. Damage by southwestern corn borer to plants in both the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth can increase aflatoxin contamination in susceptible corn hybrids.

Cochylis hospes (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) damage to male lines varies significantly and inbred susceptibility predicts damage to hybrids	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article								Larvae of Cochylis hospes (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) (banded sunflower moth) are a primary source of insect damage to seeds of cultivated sunflower, Helianthus annuus Linnaeus (Asteraceae), in North America. Field trials were used to evaluate seed damage under natural infestations for panels of publicly released male lines, publicly derived hybrids (females crossed to one common male parent), and commercial hybrids over a total of four years. For trials in 2013-2014 including 17 male lines, seed damage ranged from 3% to 19%. The least damaged male, RHA 266, was statistically similar to one other male, RHA 455. Three commercial hybrids used as checks also received very little seed damage (< 5%). In trials during 2016-2017, hybrids created by pollinating 15 different female lines with RHA 266 showed 4-14% damage. Data from female parents explained about 28% of variation in seed damage for the hybrids. Results confirm cultivated sunflower has greater variation in susceptibility to C. hospes than previously believed, and that seed damage to inbred lines provides some predictive power for hybrids. Though breeding for resistance to C. hospes seems possible, it may be too labour-intensive without relating resistance to more easily measurable traits or genetic markers.

Aflatoxin contamination of corn greatly diminishes its value and is a major impediment to profitable corn production in the South. Aflatoxin contamination is frequently linked with drought, high temperatures, and insect damage. The effects of southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar, damage on aflatoxin contamination were investigated. Aflatoxin contamination levels in conventional nonBt corn hybrids and transgenic Bt hybrids after inoculation with A. flavus and infestation with southwestern corn borer were compared. Aflatoxin contamination was highest when hybrids were inoculated with A. flavus using a technique that wounded the kernels. Aflatoxin contamination was significantly greater in nonBt than in Bt hybrids when ears were inoculated by spraying with an A. flavus conidial suspension and concurrently infesting with southwestern corn borer. Infesting conventional nonBt hybrids with southwestern corn borer resulted in significant leaf feeding, stalk tunneling, stunting, yield loss, and aflatoxin contamination. Losses were significantly reduced in transgenic Bt hybrids.

Merrill, lines. These homozygous RI were derived from an intraspecific cross of genetically distant, non-resistant, parents, Minsoy from China and Noir 1 from Hungary. Based upon a genetic map of more than 500 molecular markers, each RI line presented a unique genotype composed of a mixture of different parental alleles. The RI lines exhibited transgressive segregation with respect to their defensive effects on H. zea, such that the range of RI phenotypes far exceeded that of the parents. Similar effects were observed on the soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). We identified several independent quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to molecular markers that were associated with H. zea larval development parameters. Two QTLs affected several different traits including larval weight and developmental rate; other QTLs affected only a single trait each, i.e., larval weight, pupal weight, developmental rate, nutritional efficiency or survival. The results demonstrate that the increased range of defensive effects among the segregant RI lines is due to recombination among several parental genes that together quantitatively control plant defensive traits. Several alternative responses by herbivores have been proposed relative to plant hybrid swarms, hybrid avoidance due to higher hybrid resistance than either parent, hybrid preference due to lower resistance than either parent, hybrid equivalency to one or the other parent, or hybrid intermediacy. Within this RI population, we observed all of the proposed responses by H. zea, as might be expected when defensive traits are controlled by several genes.

Studies of mimicry have concentrated on deciphering the ecological and genetic underpinnings of dramatic switches in mimicry association, producing a well-known mosaic distribution of mimicry patterns across geography. However, little is known about the accuracy of resemblance between natural comimics when the local phenotypic optimum varies. In this study, using analyses of wing shape, pattern and hue, we quantify multimodal phenotypic similarity between butterfly comimics sharing the so-called postman pattern in different localities with varying species composition. We show that subtle but consistent variation between populations of the localized species, Heliconius timareta thelxinoe, enhance resemblance to the abundant comimics which drive the mimicry in each locality. Those results suggest that rarer comimics track the changes in the phenotypic optimum caused by gradual changes in the composition of the mimicry community, providing insights into the process by which intraspecific diversity of mimetic pattern may arise. Furthermore, our results suggest a multimodal evolution of similarity, with coordinated convergence in different features of the phenotype such as wing outline, pattern and hue. Finally, multilocus genotyping allows estimating local hybridization rates between H.timareta and comimic H.melpomene in different populations, raising the hypothesis that mimicry refinement between closely related comimics may be enhanced by adaptive introgression at loci modifying the accuracy of resemblance.

This study proposed a cascade architecture which combines the methods of deep convolutional neural network (DCNNs) and Supported Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify Lepidoptera species from their images. The data-set used in this study consists of 1301 Lepidoptera images from 22 species. Since the data-set is not large enough to fine-tune an end-to-end DCNN, we propose a customized solution using part of the DCNN as feature extractor, followed by SVMs as the insect classifiers. The proposed cascade architecture can achieve an accuracy of 100% with our testing data-set and it takes only about 200ms to recognize insect species from an image, which suggests that the proposed method can be potentially used as a real time classifier for the identification of the Lepidopterans.

Phylogenomics resolves major relationships and reveals significant diversification rate shifts in the evolution of silk moths and relatives	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Anchored Hybrid Enrichment; Targeted sequence capture; Phylogenomics; Bombycoidea; Lepidoptera; Natural history collections	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; LEPIDOPTERA; TAXA; GENE; TREE; BOMBYCOIDEA; BUTTERFLIES; ALGORITHM; RADIATION; SEQUENCE	Background: Silkmoths and their relatives constitute the ecologically and taxonomically diverse superfamily Bombycoidea, which includes some of the most charismatic species of Lepidoptera. Despite displaying spectacular forms and diverse ecological traits, relatively little attention has been given to understanding their evolution and drivers of their diversity. To begin to address this problem, we created a new Bombycoidea-specific Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE) probe set and sampled up to 571 loci for 117 taxa across all major lineages of the Bombycoidea, with a newly developed DNA extraction protocol that allows Lepidoptera specimens to be readily sequenced from pinned natural history collections. Results: The well-supported tree was overall consistent with prior morphological and molecular studies, although some taxa were misplaced. The bombycid Arotros Schaus was formally transferred to Apatelodidae. We identified important evolutionary patterns (e.g., morphology, biogeography, and differences in speciation and extinction), and our analysis of diversification rates highlights the stark increases that exist within the Sphingidae (hawkmoths) and Saturniidae (wild silkmoths). Conclusions: Our study establishes a backbone for future evolutionary, comparative, and taxonomic studies of Bombycoidea. We postulate that the rate shifts identified are due to the well-documented bat-moth "arms race". Our research highlights the flexibility of AHE to generate genomic data from a wide range of museum specimens, both age and preservation method, and will allow researchers to tap into the wealth of biological data residing in natural history collections around the globe.

A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was constructed using nuclear DNA partially digested with HindIII from eggs of Spodoptera frugiperda. The library contains a total of 36 864 clones with an average insert size of 125 kb, which corresponds to approximately 11.5 genome equivalents. Hybridization screening of the library was performed with eight single-copy genes, giving an average hit of 10 clones per marker gene. Colinearity between the genome and BACs was demonstrated at the triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) locus. Probing of the library with a PCR fragment internal to the 18S ribosomal gene allowed an estimation of the rDNA locus size close to 115 repeats per haploid genome. A new vector (pBAC3.6eGFP) for transient transfection into S. frugiperda cell lines has been constructed. It is based on the BAC vector, pBAC3.6e, in which a gene encoding GFP was inserted under the control of the densovirus P9 promoter. This vector has the advantage to accommodate large genomic inserts and to be transfected in a large lepidopteran host range. It was used to construct a second BAC library from Sf9 cell nuclear DNA in order to allow a comparison between somatic and cell line genome organization. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These taxa showed high variance amongst populations (Fsr. 0.391) and strong intertaxon genetic differentiation (FCT: 0.376). Although morphologically similar, Coenonympha gardetta and Coenonympha arcania clearly differ in their genetic characteristics; the morphologically intermediate taxa Coenonympha darwiniana darwiniana and Coenonympha darwiniana macromma are genetically well distinguished from each other and the two other taxa. Coenonympha area nia and C. d. macromma most probably share a common ancestor and evolved by cladogenesis, whereas the taxonomic situation of C d darwiniana is still unresolved: This taxon might be the result of hybridization between C. arcania and C. gardetta or it might have a common ancestor together with C, gardetta. We suggest species rank for all four taxa. The distribution of genetic diversity of these populations and the differentiation amongst populations suggest rather different hiogeographical scenarios: C. arcania most probably is of Mediterranean origin with postglacial range expansion northwards; C gardetta survived the last ice age in peripheral refugia of the Alps and has spread all over this high mountain system in the postglacial; C. darwiniana and C. macromma survived the Wurm in geographic proximity to their actual distribution areas and only have performed moderate uphill translocations during postglacial warming.

Recently it has been demonstrated that Cry hybrid proteins (by domain swapping) resulted in improved toxicities in comparison with parental proteins. Here, an SN1917 hybrid toxin was constructed and tested against Colombian pest insects Tecia solanivora (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a severe potato pest, and Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), which attacks coffee crops. The SN1917 protoxin had a concentration causing 50% mortality (LC50) of 392 ng cm-2, and SN1917 toxin showed an LC50 of 201 ng cm-2 against T. solanivora first instar larvae. The two parental toxins (Cry1B and Cry1I) used to make this new hybrid protein caused a mortality of 60% and 52%, respectively. Unfortunately, H. hampei first instar larvae proved to be resistant to the toxin. We conclude that SN1917 is an option for biological control and resistance management of T. solanivora. Implications for H. hampei are discussed.

Evaluation of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis corn hybrids against Cry1Ab-susceptible and -resistant sugarcane borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						transgenic corn; Diatraea saccharalis; Bt resistance management; Cry1Ab protein	ALLELES CONFERRING RESISTANCE; MAIZE HYBRIDS; TOXIN CRY1AB; FREQUENCY; SUSCEPTIBILITY; POPULATIONS; LOUISIANA	A Louisiana strain of the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), was selected for resistance to the Cry1Ab protein of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) by using an F, screening procedure. Survival of Bt-resistant, -susceptible, and -heterozygous genotypes of sugarcane borer was evaluated on vegetative and reproductive stages of five non-Bt and seven Bt field corn, Zea mays L., hybrids in a greenhouse study. Larval survival was recorded 21 d after infestation of neonates on potted plants. Larval survival across the three sugarcane borer genotypes and five non-Bt corn hybrids after 21 d ranged from 23.6 +/- 5.2% (mean +/- SEM) to 57.5 +/- 5.2%. Mean survival of Cry1Ab-resistant larvae on vegetative and reproductive plant stages was 12 and 21%, respectively. During the vegetative stages, all seven Bt corn hybrids were highly efficacious against Cry1Ab-susceptible and -heterozygous genotypes of sugarcane borer, with a larval survival rate of < 2% for the Bt-susceptible genotype and <= 5% for the heterozygotes. However, 8-18% of the heterozygous genotype survived on reproductive stage plants for four of the seven Bt corn hybrids tested. The variation in performance of Bt corn cultivars at vegetative and reproductive growth stages against Cry 1Ab resistant sugarcane borer suggests differential seasonal expression that may hasten resistance in the field. Bt corn hybrids expressing a "high dose" for European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), may not produce a sufficient high dose for the sugarcane borer.

We compared structure of W chromosomes in four representatives of the family Pyralidae-Ephestia kuehniella, Cadra cautella, Plodia interpunctella, and Galleria mellonella-tracing pachytene bivalents which provide much higher resolution than metaphase chromosomes. In each species, we prepared a W-chromosome painting probe from laser-microdissected W-chromatin of female polyploid nuclei. The Ephestia W-probe was cross-hybridized to chromosomes of the other pyralids to detect common parts of their W chromosomes, while the species-specific W-probes identified the respective W chromosome. This so-called Zoo-FISH revealed a partial homology of W-chromosome regions between E. kuehniella and two other pyralids, C. cautella and P. interpunctella, but almost no homology with G. mellonella. The results were consistent with phylogenetic relationships between the species. We also performed comparative genomic hybridization, which indicated that the W chromosome of C. cautella is composed mainly of repetitive DNA common to both sexes but accumulated in the W chromosome, whereas E. kuehniella, P. interpunctella, and G. mellonella W chromosomes also possess a large amount of female specific DNA sequences, but differently organized. Our results support the hypothesis of the accelerated molecular divergence of the lepidopteran W chromosomes in the absence of meiotic recombination.

The bacterium is primarily localized within the gut but is also consistently recovered in small numbers from other somatic and germinal tissues. Fatty acid profile analyses and the sequence of its 16s ribosomal RNA indicate that the bacterium is an Enterococcus related to Enterococcus sulfureus and E. casseliflavus, species that previously have been encountered in insects and on plant tissues. Injection of the Enterococcus into H. virescens hosts results in the establishment of a bacterial infection similar to that of naturally infected backcross hybrids in terms of tissue distribution and relative magnitude among tissues. Like backcross hybrid males, almost 90% of H. virescens male moths infected as larvae were sterile in single pair test matings. The inability to either rescue male fertility in backcross lines cured of the Enterococcus or to observe characteristic abnormalities in sperm ultrastructure, however, casts doubt on the likelihood that this microorganism is the proximate cause of male sterility in backcross hybrid insects.

Information on genetic features and accurate distribution of pests is the basis for agricultural protection policies. Furthermore, such knowledge is imperative to develop control strategies, understand the geographical range, and genetic patterns of this species in the Americas. Here, we carried out the widest sampling of H. armigera in the South American continent and Puerto Rico, after we estimated the diversity, demographic parameters, and genetic structure. The Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) nuclear marker was used to investigate the presence of putative hybrids between H. armigera and H. zea, and they were observed at a frequency of 1.5%. An ABC analysis, based in COI gene fragment, suggested Europe as the origin of South America specimens of H. armigeraand following a movement northward through the Caribbean. Three mtDNA genes and three nDNA markers revealed high genetic diversity distributed without the defined population structure of H. armigera in South America. Most of the genetic variation is within populations with a multidirectional expansion of H. armigera among morphoclimatic regions. High genetic diversity, rapid population expansion, and hybridization have implications for pest management since they suggest that adaptive alleles are spread through wide areas in South America that favor rapid local adaptation of H. armigera to new and disturbed environments (e.g., in agricultural areas).

We chose two groups of resistance-rated backcross chestnut that shared an F1 parent and had different American parents. Foliage from both backcross groups and the parent trees was sampled on three dates for use in feeding assays with gypsy moth larvae [ Lymantria dispar ( L.) [ Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae], adult Japanese beetles [Popillia japonica Newman ( Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)], and fall webworm larvae [Hyphantria cunea Drury ( Lepidoptera: Arctiidae)], respectively. Foliar analyses were performed concurrently and included carbohydrate, tannin, and nitrogen content, toughness, and density. Blight resistance had almost no effect on herbivore performance or foliar chemistry. When the parent trees and backcross groups were compared, however, significant differences in gypsy moth performance and Japanese beetle consumption were evident. There were no differences in fall webworm consumption. Most foliar characteristics measured differed among chestnut genotypes at some point in the season, and all varied seasonally.

Effect of Planting Date and Hybrid Selection on Helicoverpa zea and Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Damage on Maize Ears in Northeastern Mexico	SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							CORN	This study determined the impact of planting date and kernel color variety (yellow vs. white) on the incidence of the maize, Zea mays L., ear insects corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), in northern Tamaulipas, Mexico, from 2006 to 2009. Eight hybrids from six to 11 planting dates from late December to early March were evaluated each year. Overall, corn earworm and fall armyworm comprised 89 and 11%, respectively, of all Lepidoptera larvae inspected at the maize milk stage. Damage at harvest by ear insects was greater during the earlier planting dates (December), diminished during the intermediate dates (January-early February), and increased again at later planting dates (late February-March). Damage to ears of yellow maize hybrids was 53% greater than damage to white hybrids, probably because of a differential grain hardness and husk wrap. However, H-443A, a yellow hybrid with good grain and husk characteristics for the region was less damaged by corn earworm and fall armyworm than were yellow hybrids imported from the U.S.	[Rodriguez-del-Bosque, L.

At the center of the zone, hybrids are abundant, although deviations from Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria are strong, due in part to assortative mating. We measured differences across the zone in four wing color-pattern characters, three allozyme loci, and mitochondrial haplotype. Wing pattern, allozyme, and mitochondrial clines were coincident (i.e., had the same positions) and concordant (i.e., all markers had similar cline shapes, about 28 km wide). Repeated samples demonstrated that the hybrid zone has been moving eastwards at an average rate of 2.5 km/year over the past 20 years, accompanied by an equivalent movement of the mtDNA cline. No introgression of mtDNA haplotypes were found in the "wake" of the moving cline, as might be expected for a neutral marker. The concordance of morphological and mtDNA clines between 1994 and 2000, in spite of hybrid zone movement, suggests strong epistasis between the mitochondrial genome and nuclear loci. Cline movement is achieved mainly by pure fatima immigrating into amathea populations; hybrids had little effect, and were presumably outcompeted by fitter pure fatima genotypes. This movement can be explained if random dispersal of 7-19 km.gen(-1/2) is coupled with a competitive advantage to A. fatima genomes of 2-5%. Hybrid zone motion is equivalent to Phase III of Wright's shifting balance. Hybrid zone movement has rarely been considered likely in the past, but our results show that it may be more important in biogeography and evolution than generally realized.

Both CYP6AX1 and CYP6AY1 are typical microsomal P450s and their deduced amino acid sequences share common characteristics with other members of the insect P450 CYP6 family. CYP6AX1 and CYP6AY1 show the highest percent identity (36%) of amino acid to each other; both of them have 31-33% amino acid dentity with CYP6B1 from Papilio polyxenes (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), CYP6B4 from Papilio glaucus (Lepidoptera: Papiliondoe), and CYP6B8 from Helicoverpo zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidoe). Phylogenetic analysis showed the clustering of CYP6AX1 and CYP6AY1 was in the clade including CYP6AE1 from Depressaria postinocello (Lepidoptera: Oecophoriclae) and the CYP6B family members from Helicoverpo and Popilio species. Northern blot analysis revealed that both of the P450s were induced by the resistant rice variety B5 (Oryzo sofiva L), and CYP6AY1 was expressed at a higher level than CYP6AX1. The results suggest that more than one P450s are likely involved in metabolism of rice allelochemicals and that they are possibly important components in adaptation of Niloporvato lugens to host rice.

Allele frequencies at four polymorphic enzyme loci, as indicated by allozyme electrophoresis, were similar in all samples. Values for F-ST were close to zero, indicating that gene flow is high among these populations, even when separated by Lake Michigan. We developed a mitochondrial DNA marker with diagnostic differences between P. canadensis and its parapatric sister species Papilio glaucus, based on PCR-RFLP. P. glaucus haplotypes of this mtDNA marker and P. glaucus alleles of a diagnostic allozyme locus (PGD) were found in P. canadensis populations sampled in Michigan's Lower Peninsula but not in the Upper Peninsula or Northern Minnesota. The presence of P. glaucus alleles in P. canadensis populations could be due to introgression through hybridization, or could be remnants of a P. glaucus population that was inundated by an influx of P. canadensis alleles.

In Heliconius, mimicry rings typically involve distantly related species, whereas closely related species often join different mimicry rings. Genetic and behavioural studies have n how reproductive isolation in many pairs of Heliconius taxa is largely mediated by natural and sexual selection on wing colour patterns. However, recent studies have uncovered new cases in which pairs of closely related species are near-perfect mimics of each other. Here, we provide morphometric and genetic evidence for the coexistence of two closely related, hybridizing co-mimetic species on the eastern slopes of the Andes, H.melpomene amaryllis and H.timaretassp. nov., which is described here as H.timareta thelxinoe. A joint analysis of multilocus genotyping and geometric morphometrics of wing shape shows a high level of differentiation between the two species, with only limited gene flow and mixing. Some degree of genetic mixing can be detected, but putative hybrids were rare, only one of 175 specimens being a clear hybrid. In contrast, we found phenotypic differentiation between populations of H.timareta thelxinoe, possibly indicative of strong selection for local mimicry in different communities. In this pair of species, the absence of breakdown of genetic isolation despite near-identical wing patterns implies that factors other than wing patterns keep the two taxa apart, such as chemical or behavioural signals, or ecological adaptation along a strong altitudinal gradient.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 830-847.

Males of reciprocal F-1 hybrids, all of which had hairpencil glands morphologically similar to those of H. virescens, produced neither the same pheromone blend nor amounts of pheromone that were produced by males of H. virescens. Instead, these hybrid males produced pheromone that was quantitatively and qualitatively similar to that produced by H. subflexa. Hairpencil gland extracts from males obtained from backcrossing F-1 females of either cross to males of H. subflexa were the same as those of H. subflexa. However, extracts from backcross males of crosses between F-1 females and H. virescens were variable. Some extracts from these backcross males were like those of H. virescens while others were either like H. subflexa or were intermediate between those of the parent species. These results showed that the production of pheromone by the hairpencil glands of hybrid and backcross males is under the dominant regulation of autosomal genes of the H. subflexa genome.

An investigation of Sesamia attacks and fumonisin accumulation on 25 maize hybrids sown as a second crop after wheat has been performed under field conditions in Central Italy in 2000. The hybrids tested in this study showed different degrees of insect damage, ranging from 12 to 57% of damaged ears per hybrid. Over 50% of the tested hybrids showed strong insect damage, with more than 30% of harvested ears visibly damaged by Sesamia. Fungal contamination by Fusarium verticillioides and F proliferatum, two well-known producers of fumonisins, was detected in both symptomless and insect-damaged samples. Fumonisin analysis of healthy-looking and insect-damaged ear samples of each hybrid showed 100% incidence of positive samples, with fumonisin contents ranging from 0.01 to 20 mg kg(-1) for healthy-looking ears and from 27 +/- 32 to 287 +/- 221 mg kg(-1) for insect-damaged ears. Extremely high levels of fumonisins were found in ear samples visibly damaged by Sesamia, with individual values of up to 694 mg kg (-1) and average values exceeding 100 mg kg(-1) in more than 50% of the hybrids. A good correlation (r = 0.749) was found between fumonisin contamination and the degree of insect damage by Sesamia of the tested hybrids, calculated on the basis of percentage of ears visibly damaged by insects and with more than 5% kernel loss. This finding leads to the conclusion that insect damage by Sesamia on maize could be used as an early indicator of fumonisin contamination. (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.

Several previously identified species of parasitic wasps have been found to be complexes of cryptic species resulting from adaptations to specific hosts or host foodplants. Cotesia congregata (Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which has long served as a model system for host-parasitoid interactions, can be used for investigating the process of diversification among sympatric populations that differ in host and host foodplant usage. Two incipient species of C. congregata have been identified in the USA mid-Atlantic region, "MsT wasps" originate from Manduca sexta (L.) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on tobacco and "CcC wasps" originate from Ceratomia catalpae (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on catalpa. Both wasp sources can develop in either host species. Hybrids resulting from MsT male xCcC female crosses are fertile, whereas hybrids from CcC male xMsT female crosses are typically sterile. In this study, we compared relative expression in vivo of seven C. congregata bracovirus (CcBV) genes among MsT and CcC parental and hybrid crosses. Also, we established hybrid crosses between MsT and CcC wasps and four additional host foodplant sources of C. congregata. Patterns of relative expression in vivo of MsT and CcC CcBV genes differed; a few were not expressed in hosts parasitized by CcC wasps. Overall, relative expression of CcBV genes from MsT and CcC wasps did not differ with respect to the host species parasitized. Low or absent expression of CcBV genes was found in hosts parasitized by sterile hybrids. For the most part, the other four host-foodplant wasp sources were reproductively compatible with either MsT or CcC wasps and hybrid crosses with the alternative wasp source were asymmetrically sterile. Crosses involving CcC males or MsT females produced sterile hybrids that lacked mature ovaries. Cumulatively, results indicate that C. congregata is composed of two sympatric incipient species that can utilize multiple host species rather than several host-associated races or cryptic species.

J	Deering, MD; Scriber, JM				Deering, MD; Scriber, JM			Field bioassays show heterospecific mating preference asymmetry between hybridizing North American Papilio butterfly species (Lepidoptera : Papillonidae)	JOURNAL OF ETHOLOGY			English	Article						geographic variation; hybridization; hybrid zone; interspecific mating choice; mate preference; Papilio glaucus; P. canadensis; reproductive isolation	TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLIES; SEXUAL SELECTION; GLAUCUS LEPIDOPTERA; CANADENSIS; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; DISCRIMINATION; REINFORCEMENT; INTROGRESSION; CONSEQUENCES	Few studies of interspecific mating preferences of naturally hybridizing species have been done in the field. Yet this is the only way potentially critical habitat-specific factors can be included in mating behavior evaluations. We conducted mate selection (male preference) studies using tethered pairs of heterospecific, size-matched virgin yellow females of Papilio glaucus and P canadensis with free-flying male P glaucus populations in south-central Florida. and with free-flying male P canadensis populations in northern Michigan. Florida males clearly preferred the conspecific P glaucus females of the pairs, as indicated by the touches/attempted matings and by the actual copulations observed. In 1997, 66.7% of the total attempts (n = 168) and 94.2% of all copulations (n = 69) were with the conspecific. In 1998 the same pattern of conspecific male preference was observed, with 67.3% of the touches/attempts (n = 49) and 100% of the copulations (n = 30) being with the P. glaucus females. In contrast, the natural populations of P canadensis males did not show the expected conspecific preference. In fact, with wild P canadensis males in t997 a very strong preference was observed for the heterospecific P glaucus females of the pairs, accounting for 75.8% of all touches/attempted matings (n = 483) and 81.7% of all copulations (n = 476). The strong asymmetry in interspecific mating preferences among these hybridizing Papilio species may reflect an ancestral trait in P. glaucus females that elicits strong preference in P canadensis males, due perhaps to previously possessed mate sensory bias or "good genes" indicators in the females. However, reinforcement of reproductive isolation in or near the hybrid zone of species overlap (sympatry) cannot be ruled out.

We present the first comparative morphological and chemical analysis of scent organs for nine species in the genus Pyrgus, the most species-rich hesperiid genus in the Palearctic region. Our results show that the morphology of the two main male scent organs-the costal fold and the tibial tufts-does not differ between species. The chemical analyses detected a total of 125 different compounds exclusively present in these organs. We document great interspecific differences and much narrower intraspecific variability in the chemical profiles. The dynamics of chemical versus genetic distances indicate two different phases: a faster (but more variable) initial chemical divergence at lower genetic divergences (probably related to speciation) and a slower but more constant differentiation (drift). As a result most species can be identified based on their chemical profiles, except for a closely related species pair (P. malvae/P. malvoides) for which hybridisation is common in the contact zone. Our results suggest that the Hesperiidae is a group with great potential for the study of chemical communication that deserves further attention.

The resistance of 8 early maturing commercial maize hybrids and 6 experimental hybrids against European corn borer was assessed during 1996 and 1997 in Germany. Resistance was evaluated by yield reduction and damage ratings under natural and manual infestation in 11 or 6 environments, respectively. The infestation level of European corn borer was assessed by the percentage of damaged plants and number of larvae per plant in each environment. Average grain yield of the commercial hybrids was reduced by 0.28% for each 1% of damaged plants and by 6.05% for each European corn borer larvae per plant. All commercial and experimental hybrids were susceptible to European corn borer attack. The commercial hybrids showed little variation in their resistance to European corn borer. The experimental hybrids derived from crosses between resistant inbreds were more resistant than crosses between intermediate and susceptible inbreds. The evaluation of yield reduction required manual infestation because of the low natural infestation level in most environments. However, a comparison of error variances and repeatabilities revealed that they were of similar magnitude for environments with a high level of natural and manual infestation. Yield reduction and damage ratings were highly correlated (r(p) less than or equal to 0.85) under both infestation regimes. Consequently, the latter trait should be useful for indirect selection to improve European corn borer resistance in maize.

Identification and ecological characterisation of Choristoneura occidentalis (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) populations in southwestern Alberta, Canada	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							WESTERN SPRUCE BUDWORM; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; FUMIFERANA; FOREST; DELIMITATION; PICEA	The western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is an important pest of western North American coniferous forests, where its principal larval host is Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii subspecies glauca (Beissner) Murray (Pinaceae). In southwestern Alberta, Canada, populations were recently discovered feeding on an unconventional host, an Engelmann spruce, Picea engelmannii Parry ex. Engelmann x white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss hybrid (Pinaceae), in a transition zone between the two major forest types characterised by these conifer species. We use molecular evidence to verify the species identity of outbreaking Choristoneura populations collected from Douglas-fir and hybrid spruces in southwestern Alberta in 2009, and characterise the larval and male moth phenology. Both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers confirmed these populations as C. occidentalis, but admixture with Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) was detected in some individuals. Few differences associated with separate host trees were evident in the phenology of larvae and the flight period of male moths.	[Brunet, Bryan M. T.; Sperling, Felix A.

We determined if hybrids developed from these germplasm lines are also resistant to two other Diatraea spp. that attack maize in the United States [southern corn stalk borer, D. crambidoides (Grote), and the sugarcane borer, D. saccharalis (F.)]. Evaluation of three southwestern corn borer resistant and three susceptible maize hybrids for level of susceptibility to the southern corn stalk borer and sugarcane borer was done by feeding the larvae reconstituted ground, lyophilized whorl leaf tissue diets in the laboratory. Larvae of the southern corn stalk borer, sugarcane borer, and southwestern corn borer grown on the resistant leaf tissue diets were significantly smaller than those reared on the susceptible leaf powder diets. Our results indicate that these maize germplasms are resistant to all three Diatraea spp. The procedures used to obtain an adequate number of southern corn stalk borer neonates from field-collected diapausing larvae for the laboratory bioassay are discussed.

Here we describe the inheritance of adult host acceptance (oviposition) in three closely related species of Yponomeuta Latreille (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), and their interspecific hybrids. Yponomeuta cagnagellus (Hubner), a specialist on Euonymus europaeus L. (Celastraceae), Y. malinellus Zeller, a specialist on Malus spp. (Rosaceae), and Y. padellus (L.), oligophagous on a number of Rosaceae, were tested for their acceptance of parental hosts in choice tests. Acceptance of E. europaeus is semi-dominant in hybrids of Y. cagnagellusxY. padellus, and in hybrids of Y. cagnagellusxY. malinellus. The dominance of this acceptance was confirmed in oviposition tests with backcross hybrids: backcross hybrids F1 x Y. cagnagellus oviposited mainly on E. europaeus and F1 x Y. padellus still deposited more than half of their egg masses on E. europaeus. Reciprocal hybrids did not differ in their host acceptance, indicating that the trait is autosomal. We further studied the effect of larval food on adult host acceptance ('Hopkins host selection principle') in split full-sib F1 families. Larval diet influenced oviposition only in one of two hybrid crosses. The F1 hybrid of Y. padellusx Y. cagnagellus, reared on Prunus spinosa L., deposited a significantly lower percentage of egg masses on E. europaeus compared to their full-sib sisters fed with E. europaeus. We did not find this in the reciprocal cross. However, still more than half of the egg masses are deposited on E. europaeus by hybrids that have no experience on this host. We conclude that the semi-dominant character of acceptance of E. europaeus and a tendency of Rosaceae-feeding Yponomeuta to deposit egg masses on this host may have created the opportunity for the host shift of the predecessor of Y. cagnagellus from Rosaceae to the Celastraceae. This shift may have been further facilitated by a weak tendency of adults to oviposit on their larval food source.

The sex chromosomes host genes for many population differences in the Lepidoptera and therefore the inheritance of diapause determination in the butterfly Polygonia c-album may be hypothesized to be sex-linked. In the present study, Polygonia c-album (L.) from Spain and Sweden and hybrid offspring are raised under an LD 17 : 7 h photocycle that induces most pure Swedish individuals to develop into the diapausing dark morph and most pure Spanish individuals into the light and directly-developing morph. If inheritance of the daylength threshold for diapause is X-linked, as is known to be the case for host-plant preferences, females should follow the developmental path of their male parents' populations. However, female hybrids instead have a diapause propensity intermediate to that of their parental stocks and, consequentially, diapause determination is not X-linked. However, male hybrids eclose as the diapausing morph to a higher extent than females and, moreover, this pattern is more pronounced in the Spanish female x Swedish male cross than in the reciprocal cross. Hence, it is concluded that the genetic determination of the critical daylength for diapause is mainly autosomal but with some influence of sex-linked genes and/or parental effects, possibly as an effect of the importance of protandry for males. Such sex effects could provide a starting point for the evolution of population differences inherited on the sex chromosomes.

The taxonomy of the genus is hampered by the absence of diagnostic characters by which specimens can be unambiguously assigned to species. Our investigation of morphology and DNA barcode variations within and between Tomares species shows that while well-defined species (T. ballus, T mauritanicus, T callimachus, T desinens and T fedtschenkoi) diverge, poorly characterized taxa (T nogelii, T nesimachus, T dobrogensis, T romanovi and T. telemachus) show very little to no differentiation in mtDNA. We reinstate Tomares callimachus spp. hafis (Kollar, 1849) as a valid subspecies (stet. rev.) and propose taxa telemachus Zhdanko, 2000 and uighurica Kocak, Seven & Kemal, 2000 as synonyms of T. romanovi and T. nogelii nogelii respectively (syn. nov.). We relegate Polyommatus epiphania Boisduval, 1848, recently revived as a valid subspecies of T. callimachus, back to synonymy under the latter, and reconsider the status of T nogelii dobrogensis (Caradja, 1895) in the light of new molecular data. We use a nuclear gene (EF-1 alpha) in addition to COI barcodes to reconstruct the phylogeny of the group.

(Lepidoptera: Danaidae), a non-target species, to pollen from corn, Zea mays L. (Commelinales: Poaceae), from two new corn hybrids genetically modified to express different types of insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) (Bt). One hybrid expresses both Cry1Ab and Cry2Ab2 proteins (MON 810 x MON 84006), active against lepidopteran pests, and the other expresses Cry3Bb1 protein (MON 863), targeted against coleopteran pests. First instar larvae were placed on milkweed leaves (Asclepias syriaca L.) (Gentianales: Asclepiadaceae) dusted with doses of either Bt pollen or its nonexpressing (isoline) pollen counterpart ranging from 50 to 3200 grains cm(-2) of milkweed leaves, or no pollen at all. Larvae were exposed to pollen for 4 days, then moved to pollen-free leaves and observed for another 6 days. Survival was observed after 2, 4, and 10 days. Weight gain was estimated after 4 and 10 days, leaf consumption after 2 and 4 days, and larval development after 10 days. Exposure to pollen of the Cry1Ab/Cry2Ab2-Bt expressing hybrid reduced larval survival approximately 7.5-23.5% at the dose ranges tested relative to a no pollen control. Larval weight gain and consumption were reduced for larvae exposed to pollen of this hybrid and a small minority of larvae (3.1%) never developed past the third instar after 10 days of observation. Exposure to pollen of the Cry3Bb1-Bt expressing hybrid had no negative effects on larval mortality, weight gain, consumption, or development relative to the consumption of Bt-free corn pollen.

Here, we use a combination of available genome sequences, manual curation, genome and transcriptome data, phylogenetics, expression profiling and gene knockdown to investigate SNMP superfamily in various insect species with a focus on Lepidoptera. We curated 81 genes from 36 insect species and identified a novel lepidopteran SNMP gene family, SNMP3. Phylogenetic analysis shows that lepidopteran SNMP3, but not the previously annotated lepidopteran SNMP2, is the true homologue of the dipteran SNMP2. Digital expression, microarray and qPCR analyses show that the lepidopteran SNMP1 is specifically expressed in adult antennae. SNMP2 is widely expressed in multiple tissues while SNMP3 is specifically expressed in the larval midgut. Microarray analysis suggest SNMP3 may be involved in the silkworm immunity response to virus and bacterial infections. We functionally characterized SNMP1 in the silkworm using RNA interference (RNAi) and behavioral assays. Our results suggested that Bombyx mori SNMP1 is a functional orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster SNMP1 and plays a critical role in pheromone detection. Split-ubiquitin yeast hybridization study shows that BmorSNMP1 has a protein-protein interaction with the pheromone receptor (BmorOR1), and the co-receptor (BmorOrco). Concluding, we propose a novel molecular model in which BmorOrco, BmorSNMP1 and BmorOR1 form a heteromer in the detection of the silkworm sex pheromone bombykol.

They are widely distributed across the Andes and Amazonian lowlands and like other ithomiines they are involved in complex mimicry rings. This subtribe is of particular interest because it contains the most diverse ithomiine genus, Oleria, as well as two genera, Megoleria and Hyposcada, that feed on hostplants not utilized elsewhere in the tribe. Here we present the first comprehensive species-level phylogeny for the Oleriina, representing 83% of recognised species in the group, and based on 6698 bp from eight mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear (nc) genes. Topologies are largely congruent for ncDNA and the concatenated dataset and the genera Oleria, Hyposcada and Megoleria are recovered and well-supported, although strongly discordant genealogy between mtDNA and ncDNA suggest possible introgression among Hyposcada and Megoleria. A fourth clade containing the type species of ollantaya is consistently recovered, and this recently synonymized name is resurrected. Clear subdivisions within Oleria separate the genus into four species groups, onega, amalda, makrena and aegle, which also correspond to differing biogeographic and elevation range characteristics. Unlike other ithomiine genera, the Oleriina show homogeneity in mimetic wing pattern, in sharp contrast to the emerging paradigm that mimetic shifts have enhanced diversification in the tribe. Our results show a potentially more important role for geographic isolation in the diversification of the Oleriina compared to other Ithomiini studied to date and provide a framework for more detailed biogeographical studies, in addition to a rare opportunity for comparative analyses with other neotropical groups.

The effect of Bt maize on Sesamia calamistis in South Africa	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						stem borers; environmental risk; non-target effects; parasitoids; Lepidoptera; Noctuidae; ecological impact	ELDANA-SACCHARINA LEPIDOPTERA; RESISTANT TRANSGENIC PLANTS; CORN; NOCTUIDAE; BORERS	Bt maize, Zea mays L. (Poaceae) expressing Cry 1Ab insecticidal proteins was introduced for control of Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in South Africa after its development for control of crambid borers in North America. In the light of the reportedly lower toxicity of Bt maize to certain Noctuidae borers, the effect of Bt maize was evaluated on Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The characteristic larval behaviour of S. calamistis may result in reduced exposure to Bt toxin and subsequent high levels of survival. Larvae do not feed on plant whorls like other borer species but penetrate stems directly from behind leaf sheaths where eggs are laid. Greenhouse and laboratory bioassays were done with three Bt maize hybrids and their iso-hybrids. 'Whole plant methods' were used and potted plants artificially infested with eggs or larvae and survival recorded over time. Larval survival was also determined on different plant parts (whorls, stems, tillers, and ears) over time. Bt maize was shown to be highly toxic to S. calamistis. No larvae survived longer than 12-18 days on Bt maize plants in any of the experiments. Adults did not differentiate between Bt and non-Bt plants in oviposition choice experiments. Sesamia calamistis is polyphagous and occurs in mixed populations with other borer species with which it shares many parasitoid species in Africa. The ecological impact of local extinction of S. calamistis caused by this highly effective transgenic event is therefore not expected to be great.

A major complication is that a sibling species endemic to the New World, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), is morphologically very similar, with the two species capable of producing fertile hybrids in the laboratory. The consequences of such hybridization in the field are uncertain, but could result in significant and unpredictable changes in the timing, range, and pesticide susceptibilities of Helicoverpa infestations. The objective here is to provide new genetic resources applicable to Helicoverpa populations in northern Florida and neighboring states (a region at risk for H. armigera) that can distinguish the two species and possible hybrids. The genetic variability in segments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) and the Z-linked triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi) genes were determined for H. zea from the southeastern United States. These were compared to DNA sequences from H. armigera specimens from Morocco, Australia, and Europe. Phylogenetic network analysis showed a clear demarcation between the two species for all gene segments. These results extend earlier studies establishing CO1 as marker for discriminating the Helicoverpa species complex and introduce a new sex-linked genomic marker. The CO1 and Tpi markers in combination provide a more accurate and sensitive method than existing techniques for identifying hybridization between H. zea and H. armigera and could potentially be used to extrapolate the likely source of invasive H. armigera populations.

Although corn, Zea mays L., germplasm with resistance in the whorl stage to fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), and southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar, larval feeding has been identified and released, little progress has been made in identifying resistance to ear damage by these insects. Husks and silks were collected 3 to 4 d after anthesis from nontransgenic and transgenic corn hybrids and used in laboratory bioassays to determine the effects of the Bt insecticidal protein on larval survival and growth of fall armyworm, southwestern corn borer, and corn earworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie). Southwestern corn borer larvae that fed on diets containing husks of transgenic plants did not survive. Corn earworm larvae fed on diets containing husks or silks from transgenic plants died, and those that fed on diets containing silks harvested from transgenic plants exhibited reduced survival and growth. Fall armyworm larvae were least susceptible to the Bt protein, but larval survival and growth on diets containing husks of transgenic plants were reduced. Larval growth also was reduced on diets containing silks from transgenic plants. The bioassays indicated that expression in husks and silks of genes encoding Bt insecticidal proteins could be useful in reducing insect damage in ears of corn.

Molecular characterization of host strains of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) in Southern Brazil	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						mitochondrial DNA; fall armyworm; polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism; cytochrome oxidase I	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; I GENE; POPULATIONS; FLORIDA; RICE; CORN; IDENTIFICATION; SEQUENCE; CROPS	Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a Neotropical species found from Argentina to the United States of America. In its distribution area, two genetically distinct strains are found that differ in their plant host distribution. The strains are morphologically identical, and they can only be reliably distinguished by molecular markers. In this study, we characterized caterpillars collected in corn, Zea mays L., and rice, Oryza sativa L., plantations in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The mitochondrial haplotype typical of the rice strain was found in 100% of the caterpillars collected from that crop, whereas 83% of the caterpillars obtained from corn were of the corn strain haplotype. A sex-linked tandem repeat element called FR was previously shown to have a strain-biased distribution in North American Populations. We demonstrated that the same element is found in Brazilian fall armyworm and that it also organized in large tandem repeat clusters that are most frequently observed in caterpillars collected from rice and that display the rice strain mitochondrial haplotype. These results indicate that the Brazilian and North American fall armyworm populations are virtually indistinguishable with respect to the known genetic markers that are diagnostic of strain identity. Furthermore the data are consistent with other studies suggesting substantial gene flow between these widely separated populations. The strain-biased distribution of the FR element makes it a potentially useful marker to estimate interstrain hybridization frequencies of this species in Brazil.

The species-specific structures have their counterparts in the opposite sex. The internal LKM constitutes a specific reproductive isolation mechanism (lock-and-key hypothesis), which seem to be the rule in the ditrysian Lepidoptera, and also Occurs in the Carabidae (Coleoptera) and some other insects. In contrast, the external genitalia rarely have species-specific counterparts in the sexes. Several results indicate the presence of LKMs: In the Noctuidae, (1) heterospecific differences in the male vesica may prevent sperm transfer or lead to mechanical failure during copulation, (2) the more complicated the specific genitalia structures, the more aberrations may occur even in conspecific copulations, and (3) in many species pairs and groups, and in one large genus, Apamea, the structures in the opposite sexes show a strictly specific correspondence, but, (4) when there is precopulatory isolation due to differences in pheromone production or perception, the internal genitalia may be identical. Conversely, in the Colias butterflies (Pieridae), (5) frequent heterospecific hybridization is associated with the similarity of the internal genitalia. The LKMs seem to protect genomes against alien genes, supposedly selected for because of the lower fitness of specimens with an imprecise LKM and/or inferiority of hybrids. In the literature, the diversity of the noctuid genitalia has been ascribed to sexual selection, because the females were classified as polyandrous. Most species produce the main part of their eggs monandrously, and remate, if at all, in their old age, and are thus successively monandrous and polyandrous. The allopatric divergence in the structure of the internal genitalia of 39 Holarctic pairs of sister species of Noctuidae is suggested to be due to genetic drift. The insecure function of the female pheromones and external genitalia of males are illustrated with the aid of original photographs.

Signal peptides of 16 amino acids are predicted at the N-termini. According to both the phylogenetic analysis and amino acid composition (> 16% aromatic amino acids), PxAry1 and PxAry2 belong to the arylphorin-like protein genes. Analysis using Northern hybridization and RT-PCR showed varying levels of genes expression in the developmental stages with a small difference between sexes. Expression of both genes in fourth instar larvae was suppressed after treatment with a JH-analog. Southern hybridization revealed the presence of multiple arylphorin genes in the genome. Arch.

In this study, the effect of 10 corn hybrids (SC700, DC370, SC704, SC260, SC500, Keynes540, Keynes410, KSC260, KSC400 and KSC301) on life history of S. exigua was studied under laboratory conditions (25+/-1 degrees C, 65+/-5% RH, and 16:8 (L: D) h). The results showed that the longest larval and pupal period was on SC500 (29.55 and 14.33 days, respectively). The longest and shortest development time was on SC500 and KSC260, respectively (39.50 and 29.47 days, respectively). The lowest percentage of mortality and highest fecundity was observed on Keynes540. Our findings indicated that the lowest growth index in the pupal stage (2.05) and the highest percentage of mortality in larval and pupal stages were on hybrid SC700. Therefore, it was concluded that SC700 was partially resistant to S. exigua in comparison with the other hybrids tested.

Differentiation of European Corn Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and American Lotus Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Ostrinia penitalis, from North American Field Collections	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						DNA barcode; species differentiation; restriction fragment length polymorphism	RESISTANCE; NUBILALIS; SEQUENCES	The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a perennial insect pest of cultivated maize that was inadvertently introduced into North America in the early 1900s, but population densities have decreased since the widespread adoption of transgenic hybrids that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. The native American lotus borer, Ostrinia penitalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is among the most ancestral species described in the genus Ostrinia, and has a geographic range that coincides with that of O. nubilalis across major maize growing regions of North America. Due to the recent decrease in O. nubilalis populations, O. penitalis has become more pronounced in light trap samples intended to monitor O. nubilalis. A molecular tool based on variation in restriction endonuclease digestion pattern of a polymerase chain reaction amplified fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (coxI) gene was developed and validated to differentiate these two species. This method was applied to light trap samples over a 2-yr period and achieved accurate quantification of species, and shows that O. penitalis can be prevalent in O. nubilalis first flight sampling. These methods are useful for contemporary O. nubilalis field research in North America.

Additionally, these effects may be indirectly extended to higher trophic levels throughout the entire community. Quercus castanea is an oak species with characteristics of foundation species beyond presenting a wide geographical distribution and being a dominant element of Mexican temperate forests. In this study, we analyzed the influence of population (He) and individual (HL) genetic diversity of Q. castanea on its canopy endophagous insect community and associated parasitoids. Specifically, we studied the composition, richness (S) and density of leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera: Tischeridae, Citheraniidae), gall-forming wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), and canopy parasitoids of Q. castanea. We sampled 120 trees belonging to six populations (20/site) through the previously recognized gradient of genetic diversity. In total, 22 endophagous insect species belonging to three orders (Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera) and 20 parasitoid species belonging to 13 families were identified. In general, we observed that the individual genetic diversity of the host plant (HL) has a significant positive effect on the S and density of the canopy endophagous insect communities. In contrast, He has a significant negative effect on the S of endophagous insects. Additionally, indirect effects of HL were observed, affecting the S and density of parasitoid insects. Our results suggest that genetic variation in foundation species can be one of the most important factors governing the dynamics of tritrophic interactions that involve oaks, herbivores, and parasitoids.

Drawbacks of expression of a single resistance gene are the limited target spectrum and the potential for rapid adaptation of the pest. Hybrid toxins with a wider target spectrum in combination with existing toxins may be used as tool to mitigate these problems. In this study, Desiree potato plants were genetically modified to resist attack by insect species belonging to the orders Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, through the insertion of such a hybrid gene, SN19. Transgenic plants were shown to be resistant against Colorado potato beetle larvae and adults, potato tuber moth larvae, and European corn borer larvae. These are the first transgenic plants resistant to pests belonging to two different insect orders. In addition, the target receptor recognition of this hybrid protein is expected to be different from Cry proteins currently in use for these pests. This makes it a useful tool for resistance management strategies.

J	Nagoshi, RN; Meagher, RL; Nuessly, G; Hall, DG				Nagoshi, RN; Meagher, RL; Nuessly, G; Hall, DG			Effects of fall armyworm (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) interstrain mating in wild populations	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Spodoptera frugiperda; host strains; interstrain mating; FR	SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA LEPIDOPTERA; HOST STRAINS; SEQUENCE; INSECTS; SPECIATION; RFLP; CORN	Fall armyworm is a significant agricultural pest in the United States, affecting most notably sweet corn and turfgrass. Two morphologically identical strains, rice strain (R-strain) and corn strain (C-strain), exist that differ physiologically and behaviorally and can be identified by mitochondrial haplotyping. Recent studies of overwintering populations in Florida indicate that the mitochondrial lineage associated with the R-strain itself consists of two genetically distinct subgroups, with one having molecular markers consistent with interstrain hybridization between R-strain females and C-strain males. To test this possibility and examine the ramifications of interstrain mating on population behavior and strain fidelity, larvae and adult males were tested for genetic marker combinations representative of the host strains and potential hybrids. These Studies showed a sexually dimorphic distribution pattern for a sex-linked marker that is a predicted result of interstrain mating. Despite evidence of substantial interbreeding in the overwintering sites, both FR and the strain-diagnostic mitochondrial markers still showed the plant host and habitat biases associated with the host strains, indicating that strain integrity was largely maintained. However, there is evidence that the two R-strain subpopulations differ in habitat distribution in a manner suggestive of the "hybrid" genotype being less specific in its plant host preference. The existence of a genetically distinct hybrid subpopulation must be taken into account when evaluating fall armyworm population dynamics and infestation patterns in overwintering areas.

Control of S. albicosta damage to corn hybrids containing event TC1507-expressing Cry1F Bacillus thuringiensis protein alone or pyramided with event MON 89034 expressing Cry1A. 105 and Cry2Ab2 Bt proteins was tested in 2011-2015 in Ontario in small-and large-scale field plots with natural infestation. In 2011, significantly lower incidence and severity of kernel damage was sustained by Cry1F x Cry1A. 105 + Cry2Ab2 corn compared with a non-Bt near-isogenic hybrid. However, from 2012 to 2015, there was no difference in incidence or severity of damage comparing non-Bt hybrids with Cry1F hybrids alone or pyramided with Cry1A. 105 and Cry2Ab2 planted as a pure stand or with an integrated refuge (95% Bt: 5% non-Bt seeds). In 2015, neonate larvae derived from Ontario field-collections were tested in concentration-response diet-overlay bioassays with lyophilized Cry1F protein at concentrations up to 75 mu g cm(-2). The concentrations at which mortality of 50% (LC50) of the collections occurred ranged from approximately 10 mu g cm(-2) (F-0) to > 28 mu g cm(-2) (F-1) in a 7-d bioassay, indicating relative insensitivity to Cry1F. Results from field experiments, laboratory bioassays, and the history of exposure to Cry1F in corn show that S. albicosta in Ontario are not controlled by Cry1F-expressing corn hybrids and provide evidence for the conclusion that the evolution of resistance to Cry1F has occurred.

Nectar is the main floral resource, offered to pollinators in perigonal nectaries, cuniculi or spurs; these structures are often difficult to locate and to evaluate their functionality. The Neotropical Epidendrum denticulatum Barb. Rodr. and Epidendrum orchidiflorum Salzm. ex. Lindl. bloom synchronously throughout the year in the municipality of Marica (Rio de Janeiro State, SE Brazil). The flowers of E. denticulatum open in the morning, have a conspicuous pink colour, a nectar guide, and nuptial and extranuptial nectaries. During the day, they are visited by species of Hesperiidae (Lepidoptera), which remove the pollinia. The flowers of E. orchidiflorum open at night, are green with nuptial and extranuptial nectaries, and have a strong odour at night, suggesting nocturnal pollination agents, possibly moths. To date, no information is available on the reproductive biology and pollination mechanisms for E. orchidiflorum, nor is micromorphological, anatomical or histochemical data related to the presence and functionality of secretory structures associated with pollination in either species. Also, no studies have examined the occurrence of mechanisms that hinder or prevent interspecific pollination. Here, through reproductive, morphological, structural and histochemical analyses, we evaluated the floral biology and reproductive systems of these synchronopatric Epidendrum species. Both species have extranuptial nectaries, a functional cuniculus, and osmophores. Hand-pollination experiments revealed that the species are self-and intercompatible, although individuals with intermediate morphology were not identified. Pre-pollination barriers related to the floral biology of the species seem to be sufficient to prevent hybridization, but other biological aspects certainly contribute to the genetic integrity of the populations, such as the low rates of visits to flowers, low percentage of fruit and seed set, low seedling recruitment, and high investment in vegetative propagation.

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), is endemic in Pacific Northwest riparian habitats at low population densities. These moths have colonized commercial hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) plantings. Moth populations increased rapidly and became a major pest. Trap catches of male moths in mid-season surveys increased 190-fold from 95 in 2001 to > 18,500 in 2002 across 6,597 ha of poplars monitored. The outbreak of western poplar clearwings was widespread in 2002. Pheromone-baited traps placed one trap per 81.75 ha over 13,274 ha of commercial poplars captured > 108,000 male moths in 2002. Damage to commercial poplars included girdling of saplings and burrows in limbs and trunks of trees. Repeated applications of chlorpyrifos failed to reduce the abundance of moths in 2002. Two management strategies over two separate plantations of approximate to 6,500 ha each were contrasted. Future control strategies recommend a halt to the use of contact insecticides that target adult moths. Short-term (3-5 yr) control should involve a pheromone-based mating disruption strategy followed eventually by selection of a clone that is less susceptible to P. robiniae attack.

Genetic Variation and Inheritance of Diapause Induction in Two Distinct Voltine Ecotypes of Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						sex-linked; voltinism; diapause induction; genetics; critical photoperiod	EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; LARVAL DIAPAUSE; PYRALIDAE; HISTORY; INSECT; PHOTOPERIODISM; TEMPERATURE; POPULATIONS; SURVIVAL	European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), displays a larval diapause in response to short photoperiods and is adapted to a variety of local conditions throughout North America. Hence, the effective photoperiod inducing larval diapause will differ among geographic ecotypes. This study considers the inheritance of photoperiodic larval diapause induction by hybridization and backcrossing two latitudinally distinct ecotypes of the European corn borer collected between 41 degrees N, 96 degrees W and 48 degrees N, 96 degrees W and under a range of photoperiods representative of their respective locations: from 14:10 to 16:8 (L:D) h. The ecotype adapted to a bivoltine habitat (southeastern Nebraska) exhibited a shorter critical photoperiod (1480 h) than the ecotype (1533 h), originating from a univoltine habitat (northwestern Minnesota). Reciprocal F(1) crosses exhibited intermediate values with indication of sex-linked inheritance. In addition, the male parent had significantly more influence on diapause incidence of subsequent progeny than the female. The F(2) and backcross progeny further supported the supposition that diapause response is a sex-linked inheritance. The minimum number of genes estimates, and the response from backcross progeny, suggest that diapause response of European corn borer larva may be controlled by only a few loci. The overall results indicated that both ecotypes had adopted unique diapause responses, which ultimately lead to seasonal synchrony in their ecosystems.

The species hybridize to a limited extent where their ranges overlap. Field collections and censuses indicate that mimetic females occur throughout the range of P. glaucus but at lowest frequencies in populations at the latitudinal edges of its geographic range such as the southernmost part of Florida and along the entire northern edge of its distribution from Massachusetts to Minnesota. Frequencies of mimetic females have remained relatively stable over time. Inheritance of the mimetic form is controlled primarily by two interacting sex-linked loci. The typical matrilineal pattern of inheritance in P. glaucus can be explained by polymorphism at a Y-linked locus, b. Analysis of P. glaucus X P. canadensis crosses has also revealed an X-linked locus, s, which controls the expression of the mimetic phenotype. The P. canadensis allele, s(can), suppresses the mimetic phenotype in hybrid and backcross females. Results from more than 12 yr of rearing tiger swallowtails, including interspecies hybrids, indicate that the absence of mimetic P. canadensis females is due to both a high frequency of the ''suppressing'' allele s(can) and low frequency of the black-pigment-determining b+ allele. The frequency of s(can) (or other suppressing alleles of s) in P. glaucus populations outside the hybrid zone is low. Some males heterozygous at the s locus and some suppressed mimetic females occur within the hybrid zone. A simple genetic model predicts the frequency of daughters that differ in phenotype from their mothers.

Both species use a mixture of (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald) and (Z)-9-hexadecenal (Z9-16:Ald) as their sex pheromones but in widely different ratios. Hybridization and backcrossing experiments between H. armigera and H. assulta were conducted and sex pheromone compositions of the parent species, their F, hybrids and backcrosses were compared to study the genetic basis of the production of their sex pheromone blend composition. Results show that the difference in sex pheromone blend ratios of these Helicoverpa species is mainly controlled by an autosomal locus with two alleles, with the allele from H. armigera being almost completely dominant over that derived from H. assulta.

Smith), Southwestern Corn Borer Diatraea grandiosella Dyar and Sugarcane Borer Diatraea saccharalis fabricius on maize in relation to seed treatment with selected insecticides in the fields	MAYDICA			English	Article						plant resistance; fall armyworm; Sugarcane Borer; Southwestern Corn Borer; Zea mays; Lepidoptera	CHILO-PARTELLUS; RESISTANCE	In central and south America, early phenological stage of maize is attacked by several pests including Southwestern Corn Borer (SWCB), Diatraea grandiosella (Dyar) Sugarcane Borer (SCB), Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius (Lepidoptera:Pyralidae) and Fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera:Noctuidae). In order to evaluate maize germplasm for resistance against one insect species, it is often necessary to grow the crop with insecticide - treated seeds to protect it against other species. The objective of this study was to determine whether maize plants grown with insecticide - treated seeds would affect damage by SCB, SWCB and FAW. Three different experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, a susceptible (Ki3 x CML131) and a resistant (CML67 x CML135) hybrid were grown with seeds treated with the following insecticides: Semevin, Carbofuradan, Gaucho, Semevin + Carbofuradan, Semevin + Gaucho and Carbofuradan + Gaucho @ 350 g a.i/ha or 700 g a.i/ha. When 30 days - old plants were infested with neonate larvae of SWCB and FAW, the plants did not inhibit larval feeding by the two species of the insects except when the seeds were treated with Semevin + Carbofuradan. The resistant hybrid suffered less damage than the susceptible hybrid. In the second experiment, the plants of four hybrids grown with the insecticides - treated seeds were clearly distinguished into susceptible (Ki3 x CML131 and Ki3 x CML69) and resistant (Ki3 x CML139, and CML67 x CML135) hybrids under artificial infestation by FAW, SWCB and SCB. The inbred lines CML67 and CML131, grown with Carbofuradan + Gaucho or Semevin + Gaucho - treated seeds, were consistently distinguished into resistant (CML67) and susceptible (CML131) line under artificial infestation by FAW, SWCB and SCB. The observations show that the seedlings of the maize plants grown with insecticide - treated seeds remain free of undesirable wild species without interferring with damage to plants by target species of the insects. These results would be useful for screening of maize germplasm against the target species in locations where maize is attacked by several species of wild insects.

The plaque purified isolate designated as PxMNPVCL3 was found to be pathogenic to P. xylostella, Heliothis virescens (F.), Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), H. subflexa (Guenee), Helicoverpa tea (Boddie),Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), and S. frugiperda (J. E. Smith) larvae in decreasing order of susceptibility. The LC50 for diamondback moth, the most susceptible, was 6 occlusion bodies (OB)/cm(2), whereas the most resistant species, namely S. frugiperda, was 577 OB/cm(2). PxMNPVCL3 was more pathogenic to diamondback moth by 3-4 log cycles as compared with 2 broad-spectrum baculoviruses, namely Autographa californica (alfalfa looper) MNPV and Anagrapha falcifera (celery looper) MNPV. The 3 baculoviruses were compared with each other and characterized by restriction endonuclease (REN) analysis, hybridization, and neutralization tests. Fragmentation profiles generated by REN showed that the 3 baculoviruses shared some fragments in common. Hybridization studies employing digoxigenin labeled PxMNPVCL3 DNA as a probe revealed the close but distinct relationship of these 3 viruses. Neutralization tests confirmed the hybridization studies, namely that the 3 viruses although genetically similar are distinguishable from each other.

Life Table Studies of Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) on Sugarcane	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						oviposition; fecundity; intrinsic rate of increase; net reproductive rate; Logan-6	TEMPERATURE; HISTORY; NOCTUIDAE	The lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an important pest of sugarcane (a complex hybrid of Saccharum spp.) in southern Florida. Reproductive and life table parameters for E. lignosellus were examined at nine constant temperatures from 13 to 36 degrees C with sugarcane as the larval food source. The pre- and postoviposition periods decreased with increasing temperatures and reached their minimums at 33 and 36 degrees C, respectively. The oviposition period was longest at 27 degrees C. The mean fecundity, stage-specific survival, stage-specific fecundity, intrinsic rate of increase, and finite rate of increase were greatest at 30 degrees C and decreased with increasing or decreasing temperature. The net reproductive rate was greatest at 27 degrees C. The Logan-6 model best described the relationship between temperature and intrinsic rate of increase. The generation and population doubling times were longest at 13 and shortest at 33 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The most favorable temperatures for E. lignosellus population growth were between 27 and 33 degrees C. Life table parameters for E. lignosellus reared on sugarcane were greater than for the Mexican rice borer [Eoreuma loftini (Dyar) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)] reared on an artificial diet at 30 degrees C. The intrinsic rates of increase for the sugarcane borer [Diatraea saccharahs (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) reared on sugarcane or corn were the same as for E. lignosellus reared on sugarcane at 27 degrees C, but the net reproductive rate was four times higher for the former than the latter borer species.

Ears of 11 of the 126 entries received penetration ratings less-than-or-equal-to 5.7 indicating that they were the most resistant food corn hybrids to corn earworm feeding. Only TAES EXP 90206YQ, a Texas Agricultural Experiment Station cultivar, received a low larval ear-penetration rating (5.2) and produced low weight (44 mg) larvae after being fed a pinto bean diet containing dried silks. Six of the nine entries producing low weight (37-70 mg) larvae had penetration ratings > 8.0. The entries with low weight larvae and high penetration ratings had lower husk tightness ratings (XBAR = 1.1, loose husks) than the low weight larvae with lower penetration ratings (XBAR = 2.3, medium husk tightness). Loose husks could allow rapid larval entry under the husk after the larva found the silk unpalatable.

A field cage experiment deliberately infested with western bean cutworm egg masses resulted in less damage in the hybrid expressing the Cry1F protein and supported fewer western bean cutworm larvae than its non-Bt isoline. Corn hybrids expressing Cry1F, grown in small plot field experiments at three locations over two separate years and exposed to natural western bean cutworm infestations suffered less damage than non-Bt or Bt-hybrids expressing a Cry1Ab protein. Later maturing hybrids suffered more damage than shorter-season hybrids. Finally, corn ears observed in strip trials for several years in diverse agronomic conditions in farmer-cooperator fields corroborated the in-plant protection conferred by corn hybrids expressing the Cry1F protein in small plot field trials.

The Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis (Guen,e) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) feeds on maize, whereas the sympatric congener O. scapulalis (Walker) does not. In laboratory assays, the addition of 0.3 mg/g of DIMBOA to an artificial diet markedly affected the survival of O. scapulalis larvae but not that of O. furnacalis larvae. Hybrids of O. furnacalis and O. scapulalis, crossed in both directions, tolerated DIMBOA to the same extent as O. furnacalis, indicating that this tolerance was conferred by a single or a few autosomal genes that are dominant to those of O. scapulalis. In vitro, DIMBOA was rapidly catabolized when incubated with the homogenate of the digestive tract of O. furnacalis in the presence of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose. The UDP-glucose-dependent DIMBOA-catabolizing activities of the homogenate of the digestive tracts of O. scapulalis and hybrids correlated with their tolerance; low in O. scapulalis and high in the hybrids. These results reconfirmed that UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) or other UDP-dependent enzymes are involved in the catabolism of DIMBOA in O. furnacalis; however, consistent with our previous findings, DIMBOA-glucoside, the expected product of UGT, was not detected in the products of in vitro assays.

"satevis" tarapotensis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), and from hybrids produced in captivity were obtained using an improved spreading technique and were subsequently analyzed. In one of the taxa, the presence of trivalents and tetravalents at diakinesis/metaphase I is indicative of heterozygosity for multiple chromosome fusions or fissions, which might explain the highly variable number of chromosomes previously reported in this genus. Two large and complex multivalents were observed in the meiotic cells of the hybrid males (32 chromosomes) obtained from a cross between M. "s." tarapotensis (28 chromosomes) and M.s. cydon (40-43 chromosomes). The contribution of the 2 different haploid karyotypes to these complex figures during meiosis is discussed, and a taxonomic revision is proposed. We conclude that chromosome evolution is active and ongoing, that the karyotype of the common ancestor consisted of at least 48 chromosomes, and that evolution by chromosome fusion rather than fission is responsible for this pattern. Complex chromosome evolution in this genus may drive reproductive isolation and speciation, and highlights the difficulties inherent to the systematics of this group. We also show that Melinaea chromosomes, classically considered as holocentric, are attached to unique, rather than multiple, spindle fibers. (c) 2018 S.

Effects of Bt Maize on Agrotis segetum (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae): A Pest of Maize Seedlings	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bt maize; Cry1Ab; cutworm; Agrotis segetum	SOUTH-AFRICA; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; TRANSGENIC MAIZE; PROTEIN	The lepidopteran stemborers Busseoln fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Sesamia calamistis (Rawson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Chao partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) are effectively controlled by Bt maize that expresses the CrylAb insecticidal protein. Another noctuid species, the cutworm Agrotis segetum (Denis and Schiffermaller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), which is the most common and injurious pest of maize seedlings in South Africa, is exposed to Bt toxin for a part of its life cycle. The effect of this exposure to Bt maize has not been studied yet. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of Bt maize (events MON810 and Btll) on larval mass, development time, survival, and fecundity of A. segetum. Laboratory studies were conducted with first- and fourth-instar larvae and moths. Results showed that the effect of CrylAb toxin on the biology of A. segetum larvae and moths were largely insignificant. The effects of the two Bt maize events on the different parameters measured in this study was not similar between the Bt events and their respective iso-hybrids. Compared with larvae that fed on conventional (non-Bt) maize, Bt maize did not affect survival of first-instar larvae. However, mean mass of larvae that fed on Bt maize (Bt11) was significantly lower. Feeding on Bt maize did not have a significant effect on development and survival of fourth-instar larvae or moth longevity. It did, however, delay the development period to pupa formation. Fewer eggs were laid by moths fed as larvae on maize event Btll compared with MON810. This study indicates that Bt maize will most likely not have any significant effect on the control of A. segetum under field conditions.	[Erasmus, A.; Van Rensburg, J. B.

Genetically modified maize resistant to corn earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Sinaloa, Mexico	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						Bacillus thuringiensis; delta-endotoxin; Helicoverpa zea; transgenic	FALL ARMYWORM; BT	Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), the corn earworm, is a key pest causing damage to corn Zea mays L. (Poales: Poaceae). The development of hybrids expressing Cry1Ab, Vip3Aa20, and mCry3A protein of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) is an option to control this insect. Corn hybrids Agrisure (TM) 3000 GT, Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3110, and Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111 were tested for corn earworm suppression in the agricultural region of Sinaloa during the 2011, 2012, and 2013 autumn-winter growing seasons, and compared with their respective isolines. Gallery length on the ear and the number of damaged ears were evaluated. The genetically modified hybrids demonstrated the effectiveness of inserted proteins to confer resistance to the corn earworm by killing the pest or reducing its growth and damage to the ear. Based on the results, Agrisure (TM) 3000 GT, Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3110, and Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111 are useful elements for an integrated pest management program on corn in Sinaloa, Mexico.

J	Ohshima, I; Yoshizawa, K				Ohshima, Issei; Yoshizawa, Kazunori			Differential introgression causes genealogical discordance in host races of Acrocercops transecta (Insecta: Lepidoptera)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						ecological speciation; gene flow; host adaptation; hybridization; mitochondrial gene; Z-linked gene	LEAF-MINING MOTH; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENOMIC DIFFERENTIATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS; HYBRID STERILITY; DNA POLYMORPHISM	Recently diverged populations often exhibit incomplete reproductive isolation, with a low level of gene flow continuing between populations. Previous studies have shown that, even under a low level of gene flow, genetic divergence between populations can proceed at the loci governing local adaptation and reproductive isolation but not at other neutral loci. A leaf-mining moth, Acrocercops transecta, consists of Juglans- and Lyonia-associated host races. The two host races differ in host preferences of ovipositing females and in larval adaptation to host plants but mate readily in the laboratory, producing fertile hybrids. The Juglans and Lyonia races are often sympatric in the wild, implying that gene introgression could occur in nature between the two host races. We tested this hypothesis by combining phylogenetic analyses with coalescent simulations, focusing on mitochondrial genes (COI and ND5) and the nuclear Tpi, Per and Ldh genes located on the Z-chromosome. The mitochondrial genes clearly distinguished the Lyonia race from the Juglnas race, whereas the Tpi, Per and Ldh genealogies did not reflect the two host races. Coalescent simulations indicated gene flow at the three Z-linked genes in both directions, whereas there was no introgression in the mitochondrial genes. The lack of introgression in mitochondrial genes suggests that female host preference is the primary force leading to the bifurcation of maternally inherited loci. Thus, the results show that a low level of gene flow coupled with the inflexible female host preference differentiates histories of divergence between maternally and biparentally inherited genes in this host race system.

J	Hundsdoerfer, AK; Kitching, IJ; Wink, M				Hundsdoerfer, AK; Kitching, IJ; Wink, M			A molecular phylogeny of the hawkmoth genus Hyles (Lepidoptera : Sphingidae, Macroglossinae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						COX I and II; molecular phylogeny; molecular clock; Hyles; Sphingidae; biogeography	CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE-I; BUTTERFLIES LEPIDOPTERA; HELICONIUS BUTTERFLIES; EVOLUTION; SEQUENCES; CONGRUENCE; LIKELIHOOD	The hawkmoth genus Hyles is one of 15 genera in the subtribe Choerocampina of the subfamily Macroglossinae. Due to a remarkable uniformity, morphological characters usually used to identify and classify Lepidoptera at the species level cannot be used in this genus. Instead, we used DNA sequences comprising about 2300 bp derived from the mitochondrial genes COX 1, COX 11, and tRNA-leucine to elucidate the phylogeny of Hyles. The results corroborate the monophyly of Hyles but conflict with previous internal classifications of the genus based on morphology. Hyles seems to have evolved in the Neotropics during the Oligocene/Eocene epochs and the molecular data (which evolved clock-like) confirm the hypothesis that it is a very young genus that radiated on a global scale rather quickly. We hypothesize its sister group to be one of the genera Deilephila, Theretra or Xylophanes. The Nearctic may have been colonized rapidly by Hyles once the land bridge formed during the Pliocene, since within this same Epoch, the invasion of the Palaearctic appears to have proceeded from the East, via the Bering route. The colonization of Australia appears to have occurred rather early in Hyles radiation, although the route is not clear. We propose that the radiation of the Hyles euphorbiae-complex s. str. (HEC) occurred as recently as the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary and that its roots can still be reconstructed in Asia. Hyles dahlii is closely related to the HEC, but a sister group relationship to the HEC s. str. cannot be corroborated unequivocally. HEC population ranges appear to have tracked climate oscillations during the Pleistocene Ice Ages, resulting in hybridization around the Mediterranean Sea as they repeatedly intermingled. Comparison of the phylogeny with food plant affiliations leads us to hypothesize that Euphorbia monophagy evolved at least two times independently within Hyles. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A Z-linked sterility locus causes sexual abstinence in hybrid females and facilitates speciation in Spodoptera frugiperda	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Behavioral sterility; hybrid incompatibility; sex chromosome; sex chromosomal-autosomal incompatibility; unidirectional sterility	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; NOCTUIDAE HOST STRAINS; HALDANES RULE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; I GENE; DROSOPHILA; INCOMPATIBILITY; RACES; IDENTIFICATION; COMPATIBILITY	In the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), two sympatric strains have been recognized that have been termed corn strain (C) and rice strain (R), referring to their most common host plants. Both strains are reproductively isolated via a distinct prezygotic barrier as well as via an intriguing postzygotic phenomenon: when R females have mated with C males, the resulting RC hybrid females exhibit dramatically reduced fertility independent of their mating partner. Here, we demonstrate that the reduced fertility is caused by the fact that these females refrain from mating, that is, females are behaviorally sterile. We identified a Z-chromosomally linked sterility locus that is most likely incompatible with yet to be identified autosomal (or cytoplasmic) factors, leading to the observed sexual abstinence. Within-chromosome mapping revealed the sterility locus to be located in an area of strongly reduced interstrain recombination.

Fiber yield was highest in Gs strain. SDS-PAGE profile showed 11 prominent bands in the strains with molecular weight ranging from 35 to 200 kDa together with 28 minor bands with molecular weight ranging from 33 to 210 kDa. Two polypeptides of molecular weight 90 and 110 kDa were absent in both Y and Ys. Eight random primers and one universal primer used for RAPD analysis generated a total of 79 bands, of which 49 were polymorphic. In both SDS-PAGE and RAPD, the UPGMA based dendrogram showed two clusters: cluster 1 included Gs and G, whereas Y and Ys was grouped in cluster 2 by SDS-PAGE analysis but RAPD analysis grouped Ys and G in cluster 1 and Gs and Y in cluster 2. The range of genetic diversity observed among the strains affirms the potentiality of RAPD technique for identification and selection of distant parents for silkworm hybridization for high silk yield.

Biology, host specificity and DNA barcoding of cryptic Eueupithecia species (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), and implications for biological control of Parkinsonia aculeata (Fabaceae) in Australia	AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						native range survey; natural enemy; no-choice test; species delimitation	CONTROL AGENTS; CAESALPINIACEAE; ESTABLISHMENT; LEGUMINOSAE; INSECTS; RELEASE	Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae), native to the Americas, is a designated Weed of National Significance in Australia. The leaf-feeding geometrid moth species, Eueupithecia cisplatensis Prout (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), was identified as a potential biological control agent of P. aculeata following native range surveys in Argentina. After importation into quarantine for host specificity assessment, this species was identified as a cryptic species complex of two morphologically similar species. The new species, Eueupithecia vollonoides Hausmann (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), was subsequently described. The biology and host range of both moth species were examined to determine their suitability as biological control agents. Host specificity was evaluated in the native range, by surveying insects found on closely related plant species, and in the laboratory, by no-choice larval development tests. Native range surveys and laboratory assays revealed a high level of specificity to P. aculeata by both Eueupithecia species. Of the 71 plant species from the Fabaceae family that were tested, E. cisplatensis completed development on only one non-target species, Parkinsonia praecox. This plant species is not present in Australia, and no Eueupithecia species were found to use P. praecox in the field in its native range. Hence, the risk of non-target effects if these species were to be released in Australia was considered to be low. One mitochondrial (COI) gene region and two nuclear (28S and CAD) gene regions were tested for their ability to differentiate between the two cryptic species. COI haplotypes from E. cisplatensis and E. vollonoides belong to two divergent haplotype groups and can reliably distinguish either species from the other. Some 28S and CAD gene haplotypes are shared at low frequencies, perhaps because of rare or historical hybridisation or incomplete lineage sorting, thus cannot reliably discriminate between the species. This pattern of mito-nuclear discordance requires further elucidation using population genetics studies to determine its biological significance. Based on the results of host specificity tests, E. cisplatensis and E. vollonoides were approved for release in Australia in May 2013 and May 2014, respectively.

J	Clark, TL; Witkowski, JF; Foster, JE				Clark, TL; Witkowski, JF; Foster, JE			Parasitism rates in European corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) larvae collected from six maize hybrids	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						parasitism; parasitoid; Ostrinia nubilalis; European corn borer; Macrocentrus grandii; Eriborus terebrans; Lixophaga sp.; Zea mays; maize hybrid	NUBILALIS HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; PYRALIDAE	The parasitoid complex and level of parasitism of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), larvae in six maize, Zea mays L., hybrids was determined in Nebraska during 1995 and 1996. Three parasitoids, Eriborus terebrans (Gravenhorst), Macrocentrus grandii Goidanich, and Lixophaga sp., were reared from field-collected European corn borer larvae. Larvae collected from Hoegemeyer 2626 exhibited the highest percentage parasitism for the 1995 first generation in Lancaster (37.2%) and Dixon (28.6%) counties. No significant differences were identified for the 1995 second generation at both sites because of reduced sample size and high larval mortality caused by naturally-occurring entomopathogens. During 1996, there were several significant differences in percentage parasitism of larvae collected from the hybrids. Larvae collected from Northrup King N7070 exhibited the highest first-generation parasitism (23.8%), while larvae collected from Hoegemeyer 1125W exhibited the highest second-generation parasitism (46.0%) in Dixon Co. In Lancaster Co., parasitism of first-generation larvae collected from Hoegemeyer 1125W (10.3%) was only significantly greater than parasitism of larvae collected from Hoegemeyer 2626 (1.1%). Results indicate that European corn borer larval parasitism is significantly affected by the maize hybrid planted in the field; however, differences may vary among years and generations as environmental factors affect the maize phenology.

Cross-species amplification and polymorphism of microsatellite loci in Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Brazilian cropping systems	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Helicoverpa; Microsatellite; Hybridization; Old World bollworm; Corn earworm; Invasive species	HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; COTTON BOLLWORM; HELIOTHIS-ZEA; MARKERS; NORTH; CHINA	The Old World bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) was recently discovered in Brazil. This species is closely related to the New World bollworm H. zea (Boddie), and mating between these species has already been reported under laboratory conditions. Here, we tested the cross-species amplification of 20 microsatellite (SSR) loci in field populations of H. armigera and H. zea collected from Brazilian cropping systems. Seven SSR loci were successfully amplified and polymorphic in both species except for the locus HaC14, which was monomorphic for H. zea. All SSR loci were in linkage equilibrium, and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were only observed for the locus HarSSR1 in the HaRS-2 population, where null alleles were present. A moderate level of polymorphism was detected in H. armigera and H. zea populations with a mean allele number of 4.14, and 2.24, respectively. Interestingly, most of the populations of the recent invader H. armigera showed higher genetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients than H. zea populations. The genetic identity of each species was recovered using a STRUCTURE analysis, where the populations formed two clusters (K = 2) according to their species. STRUCTURE also suggested the occurrence of potential hybrid offspring between H. armigera and H. zea individuals in natural conditions. These SSR loci will be valuable in characterizing population differentiation, invasion routes, adaptation, reproductive behavior, and intra-and interspecific gene flow in H. armigera and H. zea populations in Brazil, the USA, and other areas where these two pests occur.

Effect of Clonal Variation Among Hybrid Poplars on Susceptibility of Gypsy Moth (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp kurstaki	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Popular; Lymantria dispar; short rotation trees; biomass production; microbial pesticides	COTTONWOOD LEAF BEETLE; CRY1A(A) D-ENDOTOXIN; PHENOLIC GLYCOSIDES; INDUCED RESISTANCE; INSECT HERBIVORES; GENETIC-VARIATION; FOLIAR CHEMISTRY; PERFORMANCE; POPULUS; CHRYSOMELIDAE	Trees in the genus Populus can provide substantial commercial and ecological benefits, including sustainable alternatives to traditional forestry. Realization of this potential requires intensive management, but damage by defoliating insects can severely limit productivity in such systems. Two approaches to limiting these losses include cultivation of poplar varieties with inherent resistance to pests and application of microbial pesticides. Little is known about the interaction between host resistance and the ability of poplars to support the efficacy of biocontrol agents. The research described here was conducted to survey the effect of hybrid poplar clones on gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), a pest on these trees. We assessed the effect of various poplar clones on larval performance and susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. Larvae were reared from hatching on the foliage of 25 hybrid poplar clones and we monitored larval survival, development time, and weight at fourth instar. Eight of these clones showed high resistance against gypsy moth. The remaining clones showed high variation in their effect on larval performance. We evaluated the susceptibility of third-instar larvae to B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki when reared on the 17 remaining clones. There was a significant effect of poplar clone on time to death after ingestion of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. The susceptibility of gypsy moth larvae to B. thuringiensis on various clones was not correlated with the effects of these clones on larval performance in the absence of B. thuringiensis, suggesting this interaction is more complex than merely reflecting higher mortality to previously stressed larvae.

Impact of plant resistance on southwestern corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) biology and plant damage	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						host plant resistance; southwestern corn borer	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; LEAF-FEEDING RESISTANCE; SUSCEPTIBLE CORN; MAIZE GERMPLASMS; NOCTUIDAE LARVAE; PYRALIDAE; REGISTRATION; GROWTH; INFESTATION; HYBRIDS	Southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a major insect pest of corn, Zea mays L., in the southern United States. Germplasm lines with resistance to southwestern corn borer have been developed and released by the USDA-ARS. Two single-cross hybrids produced by crossing germplasm lines with resistance to southwestern corn borer and a susceptible single-cross hybrid were infested with southwestern corn borer larvae in a 2-yr field test conducted in Mississippi. The susceptible hybrid sustained significantly more leaf damage and stalk tunneling than either resistant hybrid. The number of tunnels and the length of tunneling were significantly lower on the resistant hybrids. In 2003, up to 15 times more tunneling was observed on the susceptible hybrid. Larvae feeding on the resistant hybrids were delayed in their movement from the whorl to the stalk and larval survival was 50% lower on the resistant hybrids than on the susceptible hybrid. Larvae recovered from the susceptible hybrid 7-14 d after infestation weighed twice as much as those recovered from the resistant hybrids. Similar differences in larval weight were observed in the laboratory when larvae were reared on diets prepared from lyophilized tissue from the three hybrids. These results provide a foundation for other investigations designed to identify and determine the roles of specific genes and gene families associated with southwestern corn borer resistance in corn.

A single major QTL controls expression of larval Cry1F resistance trait in Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and is independent of midgut receptor genes	GENETICA			English	Article						Quantitative trait locus (QTL); Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP); Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)	EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; BRUSH-BORDER MEMBRANE; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS TOXINS; INSECT RESISTANCE; CROSS-RESISTANCE; MANDUCA-SEXTA; HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; CADHERIN RECEPTOR; DELTA-ENDOTOXINS; LINKAGE MAP	The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is an introduced crop pest in North America that causes major damage to corn and reduces yield of food, feed, and biofuel materials. The Cry1F toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) expressed in transgenic hybrid corn is highly toxic to O. nubilalis larvae and effective in minimizing feeding damage. A laboratory colony of O. nubilalis was selected for high levels of Cry1F resistance (> 12,000-fold compared to susceptible larvae) and is capable of survival on transgenic hybrid corn. Genetic linkage maps with segregating AFLP markers show that the Cry1F resistance trait is controlled by a single quantitative trait locus (QTL) on linkage group 12. The map position of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers indicated that midgut Bt toxin-receptor genes, alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase N, and cadherin, are not linked with the Cry1F QTL. Evidence suggests that genes within this genome interval may give rise to a novel Bt toxin resistance trait for Lepidoptera that appears independent of known receptor-based mechanisms of resistance.

Resolving Relationships among the Megadiverse Butterflies and Moths with a Novel Pipeline for Anchored Phylogenomics	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY			English	Article						Exon; hybrid enrichment; phylogenetics; sequence capture; target capture; transcriptomics; ultraconserved elements	HIGHER-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION; ULTRACONSERVED ELEMENTS; MISSING DATA; GENOME; SEQUENCE; GENE; TREE; EVOLUTIONARY; ENRICHMENT; CAPTURE	The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has allowed for the collection of large portions of the genome for phylogenetic analysis. Hybrid enrichment and transcriptomics are two techniques that leverage next-generation sequencing and have shown much promise. However, methods for processing hybrid enrichment data are still limited. We developed a pipeline for anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) read assembly, orthology determination, contamination screening, and data processing for sequences flanking the target "probe" region. We apply this approach to study the phylogeny of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), a megadiverse group of more than 157,000 described species with poorly understood deep-level phylogenetic relationships. We introduce a new, 855 locus AHE kit for Lepidoptera phylogenetics and compare resulting trees to those from transcriptomes. The enrichment kit was designed from existing genomes, transcriptomes, and expressed sequence tags and was used to capture sequence data from 54 species from 23 lepidopteran families. Phylogenies estimated from AHE data were largely congruent with trees generated from transcriptomes, with strong support for relationships at all but the deepest taxonomic levels. We combineAHEand transcriptomic data to generate a new Lepidoptera phylogeny, representing 76 exemplar species in 42 families. The tree provides robust support for many relationships, including those among the seven butterfly families. The addition of AHE data to an existing transcriptomic dataset lowers node support along the Lepidoptera backbone, but firmly places taxa with AHE data on the phylogeny. Combining taxa sequenced for AHE with existing transcriptomes and genomes resulted in a tree with strong support for (Calliduloidea + Gelechioidea + Thyridoidea) + (Papilionoidea + Pyraloidea + Macroheterocera). To examine the efficacy ofAHEat a shallowtaxonomic level, phylogenetic analyseswere also conducted on a sister group representing amore recent divergence, the Saturniidae and Sphingidae. These analyses utilized sequences from the probe region and data flanking it, nearly doubled the size of the dataset; resulting trees supported new phylogenetics relationships, especially within the Saturniidae and Sphingidae (e.g., Hemarina derived in the latter). We hope that our data processing pipeline, hybrid enrichment gene set, and approach of combining AHE data with transcriptomes will be useful for the broader systematics community.

This study analyzed the cytopathology of B. mori trachea to BmNPV, isolated geographically in Parana state, Brazil. Fifth instar larvae were divided into two groups, control and inoculated; the viral suspension used was 2.4 x 10(7) polyhedral occlusion bodies/mL. From the second to the ninth day post-inoculation, segments of silkworm organs, containing the trachea, were processed for transmission electron microscopy. Analyses of fresh hemolymph were also performed to verify the susceptibility of the hemocytes. Signs of infection were initially detected in the hemocytes and in the tracheal cells on the second and fourth post-inoculation days, respectively. The cytopathology of the trachea showed all stages of the viral cycle, which was the same as in other tissues. Virions were detected in the basal lamina, which showed structural disorganization.

A survey in Texas and Louisiana was conducted in 2002 to determine if B. graminea has extended its range into the U.S. Surveys included five nights of blacklight trapping in Texas and three nights of blacklight trapping plus diurnal surveys of 23 fields in Louisiana. Field surveys in Louisiana included examination not only of sugarcane (interspecific hybrids of Saccharum spp.) but also of maize, Zea mays L., and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, as well as non-cultivated gramineous species. We did not collect B. graminea during blacklight trappings nor did we detect it in association with cultivated host species (i.e., sugarcane, maize, and sorghum). We did, however, discover B. graminea in smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., in Louisiana in a non-agricultural environment. Finding B. graminea only in cordgrass suggests the possibility that rather than expanding its geographic range, B. graminea may be a widespread tropical species that is expanding its host range from native grasses to sugarcane. Finding B. graminea in Louisiana represents a new U.S. record for the species. Also, from this survey, new U.S. hosts records for Pyroderces badia (Hodges) (Lepidoptera: Cosmopterigidae) and Dicymolomia julianalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), moths reared from grain sorghum seedheads, are documented.

The framework of these hybrid nanostructures has been associated with the formation of Cu-3(PO4)(2)center dot 3H(2)O (pure copper phosphate nanoflowers). In this study, we investigated the formation of pure copper phosphate nanoflowers (p-CPnfs), and their effects on hemocytes and enzymatic responses in Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) as a model organism. Therefore, the effects of p-CPnfs on G. mellonella hemocytes and on the activities of hemolymph acetylcholine esterase (AChE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) enzymes were evaluated after a 24-h p-CPnfs treatment in the G. mellonella larvae. Different concentrations of p-CPnfs (100, 500, 1000, 2000, 6000 ppm) were cautiously force-fed to the fourth instar larvae through the mouth of the insect by means of a micro-fine insulin syringe without causing any physical damage. 1000, 2000, and 6000 ppm of p-CPnfs significantly increased the total hemocyte counts (THCs) of the G. mellonella larvae. 500, 1000, 2000, and 6000 ppm of p-CPnfs increased the SOD activity of the larvae. 1000, 2000, and 6000 ppm of p-CPnfs increased the CAT activity in the hemolymph of the larvae. Unlike the results seen in SOD and CAT enzyme activities, all concentrations of p-CPnfs decreased AChE activity in the larval hemolymph. In addition to these results, LC50 value was found to be 8410 ppm for the force-fed larvae at the end of the 24-h period.

Anchored hybrid enrichment phylogenomics resolves the backbone of erebine moths	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Anchored phylogenomics; Erebidae; Noctuoidea; Owlet moths; Phylogeny; Target capture	HIGHER-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION; NOCTUOIDEA INSECTA; PHYLOGENETIC UTILITY; SPECIES LEPIDOPTERA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; NUCLEAR; PERFORMANCE; BUTTERFLIES; NOCTUIDAE; REVISION	The subfamily Erebinae (Lepidoptera, Erebidae) includes approximately 10,000 species with many still undescribed. It is one of the most diverse clades within the moth superfamily Noctuoidea and encompasses a diversity of ecological habits. Erebine caterpillars feed on a broad range of host plants including several economically important crops. Adults possess a unique array of adaptations for predator defense, including some of the most sensitive hearing organs (tympana) across the Lepidoptera and striking wing coloration to startle visual predators. Despite the relevance of these moths to agriculture and ecological research, a robust phylogenetic framework is lacking. Here we used anchored hybrid enrichment, a relatively new approach in phylogenomics, to resolve relationships among the subfamily. Using the recently developed Lep1 anchored hybrid enrichment probe set, 658 gene fragments with an average length of 320 bp were captured from an exemplar set of 75 erebine species, representing 73 genera and 23 tribes. While the total number of erebine tribes is not firmly established, this represents at least 75% of known tribal level diversity. Anchored hybrid enrichment data were partitioned by locus and by codon position for maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis and coalescent-based species-tree approaches. Results from our study provided strong nodal support (BP >= 95) for nearly all nodes in the partitioned ML tree, solidifying many relationships that were previously uncertain or moderately supported based on morphology or a smaller number of gene fragments. Likelihood analyses confidently resolved the placement of Acantholipini as a sister tribe to Sypnini and all other Erebinae. The remaining tribes were placed in a single, strongly supported clade split into two major subclades. Additionally, 25 tropical species that did not have previous tribal assignments are confidently placed on the phylogeny. Statistical comparisons with Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) tests found that our maximum likelihood trees were significantly more likely than alternative hypotheses. This study demonstrates the utility of anchored phylogenomics for resolving relationships within subfamilies of Lepidoptera.

The work was conducted in Montenegro, RS, in an organic orchard of the hybrid 'Murcott' (Citrus sinensis x C. reticulata). Samplings were taken every other week, from May 2003 to May 2004, with a ring of 0.28 m(2) being randomly thrown in the lines and interlines of 30 trees. All the plants with mines inside of the ring were collected. The screening of the material was made in laboratory. Eleven species of leafmining Lepidoptera and 12 species of microhymenopteran parasitoids were found.

Fall Armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Southwestern Corn Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) Leaf Feeding Damage and Its Effect on Larval Growth on Diets Prepared from Lyophilized Corn Leaves	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Diatraea grandiosella; Spodoptera frugiperda; Zea mays; Lepidoptera; Crambidae; Noctuidae; host plant resistance		Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), and Southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar, are economically important pests of maize (Zea mays L.) in the southeastern United States. These insects attack plants in both the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth. Plant resistance is widely considered a desirable means for reducing losses to both insects, and corn germplasm lines with resistance to leaf feeding damage have been developed and released. Fall armyworm and southwestern corn borer larvae feeding on resistant genotypes g-row more slowly than those feeding on susceptible genotypes. The objectives of the investigation were to evaluate 20 single cross maize hybrids for leaf feeding damage by southwestern corn borer and fall armyworm, to compare larval growth on laboratory diets prepared from lyophilized leaf tissue of single cross hybrids with different levels of resistance to leaf feeding, and to determine whether larval growth differed between diets prepared from leaf tissue collected from plants previously infested with southwestern corn borer or fall armyworm and non-infested plants. Both fall armyworm and southwestern corn borer larvae weighed significantly less when fed on laboratory diets prepared from lyophilized leaf tissue of resistant single cross hybrids than susceptible hybrids. When tissue from either resistant or susceptible plants that had been infested with either insect in the field was used in bioassays, larval weights were further reduced. It appears that both constitutive and induced defensive mechanisms may be operating.	[Williams, W.

(Poales: Poaceae), in Mexico. The development of genetically modified (GM) corn hybrids for resistance to this insect, with the inclusion of several genes coding for proteins Cry1Ab, Vip3Aa20, and mCry3A of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) (Bt), offer an alternative to conventional insecticides to control this pest. Resistance to fall armyworms of the GM corn hybrids Agrisure 3000 GT, Agrisure Viptera 3110, and Agrisure Viptera 3111 was evaluated in 4 locations at Sinaloa for a 3 yr period. Damage evaluation showed that the maize hybrids with the Bt gene insertion were not affected by the fall armyworm as compared with their respective isolines, which were seriously damaged. The results reaffirm the insect control benefits provided by this technology and provide a baseline for resistance management.

Hybridization of radiolabeled EHL-NPV genomic DNA revealed that the EHL- and WHL-NPVs share considerable DNA sequence similarity, as radiolabeled EHL-NPV DNA hybridized strongly with all WHL-NPV DNA bands. The EHL-NPV polyhedrin gene hybridized strongly with WHL-NPV DNA, but the hybridization patterns of the two NPVs were different, Very weak hybridization was detected between the EHL-NPV polyhedrin gene and DNAs of the two WOL-NPVs, Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the polyhedrin genes of EHL-NPV and WHL-NPV differ in sequence by only eight nucleotide substitutions (five third position and three second position changes, resulting in four amino acid substitutions). Phlyogeneitc analysis using the polyhedrin genes of EHL-NPV and WHL-NPV indicate that these two viruses cluster with the Group II NPVs as described by Zanotto, Kessing, and Maruniak.

AFLP Linkage Map of Hybridizing Swallowtail Butterflies, Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY			English	Article						AFLP; hybrid zone; Lepidoptera; Papilionidae	SEX-LINKED DIAPAUSE; GENES; LEPIDOPTERA	High-density linkage maps provide powerful tools for studying the genetic basis of ecologically relevant adaptations and the genomic scope of introgression. We back-crossed an F-1 hybrid male Papilio glaucus/Papilio canadensis tiger swallowtail butterfly to a pure P. glaucus female and constructed amplified fragment length polymorphism linkage maps from the progeny. The paternal map contains 309 markers distributed among 29 linkage groups, with a corrected map distance of 1167 cM (logarithm of the odds [LOD] = 4.0). The average linkage group contained 10.65 +/- 4.85 markers separated by 32.7 +/- 3.8 cM, with statistically significant clustering. The paternal hybrid map had 18.65% more markers than the maternal P. glaucus map, which provides a rough estimate of the extent of genetic differentiation between the species. The maternal map contains 253 markers among 28 linkage groups, without the X and Y chromosomes. Segregation distortion from expected Mendelian ratios was observed for 94/1096 scored loci (8.6%, P < 0.05). The X chromosome map includes 7 markers spanning 29.3 cM (LOD = 3.0). These naturally hybridizing, female heterogametic species are used to study important questions in the maintenance of species boundaries, sex chromosome introgression, sex-limited mimicry, and host plant use. The map will facilitate research into the physiological, ecological, and evolutionary genetics of these phenomena.

This diapause state is predominantly induced by photoperiod. The photoperiod varies with latitude and has led to local adaptation in the photoperiodic induction of diapause in many insects. To understand the rapid evolution of the photoperiodic threshold, it is important to investigate and understand the underlying genetic mechanisms. In the present study, the genetic basis of photoperiodic diapause induction is investigated in the green-veined white butterfly Pieris napi (Lepidoptera, Pieridae) by assaying diapause induction in a range of conditions for a Swedish and Spanish population. Furthermore, the inheritance of diapause induction is assessed in reciprocal F1 hybrids and backcrosses between the two populations. The southern population shows a clear photoperiodic threshold determining diapause or direct development, whereas the northern populations show a high incidence of diapause, regardless of photoperiod. The hybrid crosses reveal that the inheritance of diapause induction is strongly sex-linked, and that diapause incidence in the genetic crosses is highly dependent on photoperiod. This emphasizes the importance of assaying a range of conditions in diapause inheritance studies. The results indicate a strongly heritable diapause induction with a major component on the Z-chromosome, as well as a minor effect of the autosomal background.

Previously, three SNMPs were identified, characterized and functionally investigated in a lepidopteran model insect,Bombyx mori. However, whether these results are consistent across other lepidopteran species are unknown. Here genome and transcriptome data analysis, expression profiling, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the yeast hybridization system were utilized to examinesnmpgenes ofHelicoverpa armigera, one of the most destructive lepidopteran pests in cropping areas.In silicoexpression and qRT-PCR analyses showed that, just as theB. mori snmpgenes,H. armigera snmp1(Harmsnmp1) is specifically expressed in adult antennae.Harmsnmp2is broadly expressed in multiple tissues including adult antennae, tarsi, larval antennae and mouthparts.Harmsnmp3is specifically expressed in larval midguts. Further RNAseq analysis suggested that the expression levels ofHarmsnmp2andHarmsnmp3differed significantly depending on the plant species on which the larvae fed, indicating they may be involved in plant-feeding behaviours. Yeast hybridization results revealed a protein-protein interaction between HarmSNMP1 and the sex pheromone receptor, HarmOR13. This study demonstrated that SNMPs may share same functions and mechanisms in different lepidopteran species, which improved our understanding of insectsnmpgenes and their functions in lepidopterans.

Hairpencil Volatiles Influence Interspecific Courtship and Mating Between Two Related Moth Species	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Heliothis virescens; Heliothis subflexa; Lepidoptera; Pheromone; Hybridization; Reproductive isolation	HELIOTHIS-SUBFLEXA LEPIDOPTERA; HYBRID MALE MOTHS; EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; SEX-PHEROMONE; VIRESCENS F; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS; NOCTUIDAE; INHERITANCE; PYRALIDAE	Reproductive isolation between sympatric, closely related species can be accomplished through a variety of pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms, including courtship-signaling behavior that involves pheromones. In the moths Heliothis virescens and H. subflexa, males display abdominal hairpencils (HP), which release volatile chemicals during courtship. In this study, we demonstrated that HP volatiles released by male H. subflexa function to improve mating success with conspecific females. Interspecific mating experiments were conducted to determine any influence of HP volatiles on species isolation. Female H. virescens and H. subflexa were observed during courtship with males of the other species, following either sham-operation or ablation of HPs, both with and without concurrent presentation of HP volatiles. Mating success was improved by co-presentation of HP extract from males of the same species during courtship. Ablation of HPs improved mating between H. subflexa females and H. virescens males. During interspecific matings, male H. virescens attempted copulation less frequently in the presence of H. virescens HP extract, though H. subflexa males were not affected by the presence of H. subflexa HP extract. This suggests that HP volatiles produced by males of each species may inhibit mating between species through effects on males (H. virescens) and females (H. subflexa).

The mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of the all-female broods in Hokkaido were different from those of normal Hokkaido females and were the same as those widely distributed in Asia, including Tokyo (TK). Goldschmidt obtained all-female broods through backcrossing, that is, F1 females obtained by a cross between TK females (L. dispar japonica) and Hokkaido males (L. dispar praeterea) mated with Hokkaido males. He also obtained all-male broods by mating Hokkaido females with TK males. Goldschmidt inferred that female- and male-determining factors were weakest in the Hokkaido subspecies and stronger in the Honshu (TK) subspecies. According to his theory, the females of all-female broods mated with Honshu males should produce normal sex-ratio broods, whereas weaker Hokkaido sexes would be expected to disappear in F1 or F2 generations after crossing with the Honshu subspecies. We confirmed both of Goldschmidt's results: in the case of all-female broods mated with Honshu males, normal sex-ratio broods were produced, but we obtained only all-female broods in the Goldschmidt backcross and obtained an all-male brood in the F1 generation of a Hokkaido female crossed with a TK male. We found no endosymbionts in all-female broods by 4,06-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Therefore, the all-female broods observed in L. dispar are caused by some incompatibilities between Honshu and Hokkaido subspecies.

Due to the restricted knowledge about the influence of tomato cultivars on the biology of the species, the development and reproduction of N. elegantalis was evaluated on three tomato cultivars. In the hybrid Giuliana the development from oviposition to adult emergence was longest (56.2 days) in comparison to the cultivar Santa Clara (50.2 days) and the hybrid Paronset (50.7 days). Pupal weight was significantly lower in Giuliana. The mean fecundity of females fed on Giuliana during the larval stage was 88.6 eggs per female, 82.3 in Paronset and 37.0 on Santa Clara, but egg viability was higher for females fed during the larval stage on Santa Clara (79.0%). The hybrid tomato Giuliana had the highest impact on the development and reproduction of N. elegantalis. These findings can be useful as a plant resistance factor in the field to reduce the number of generations of the pest and to favour the action of natural enemies by decreasing the fitness of the pest.

In field tests, females reared (< 1 generation) from field-collected larvae were significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) less attractive to wild males than were females reared in the laboratory for 40 generations (HVL-40), but the attractancy of females reared in the laboratory for 1 or 41 generations did not differ significantly. The attractancy of H. virescens females from generations 40, 41 and BC females from generations 41, 42 or 179, 180 did not differ significantly in any of five tests, except in test three, where more wild males were attracted by HVL-40 than by BC-41 females. Continuous backcrossing of the female hybrid (180 generations) did not affect the attractivity of the female to the wild males. The attractancy of lab-reared H. virescens (except for generation 40) or hybrid BC virgin females, regardless of generation, to wild H. virescens males was not significantly different from that of the synthetic female sex pheromone Z-11-Hexadecenal: Z-9-tetradecenal (14.6:1). The data indicate the attractancy of H. virescens and BC virgin females to wild males may be enhanced by continuous laboratory rearing. These findings are important in population dynamic studies in which lab-reared females are used and in determining the ratio of BC to wild H. virescens females needed to suppress a given population of H. virescens.

Sampled shoots were examined in the lab and the number (if leaves, presence or absence of mines and the number of mines, eggs, larvae and pupae were recorded. In both orchards there were no records of P. citrella mines in the first leaf flush, from August to October. In the first year, the highest mine densities were recorded in the middle of November, beginning of January and in April for both orchards. In the following year, the highest mine and larval densities were in January and April for C. deliciosa var Montenegrina and from December to March for 'Murcott'. Although the number of shoots has always been greater in C. deliciosa, the citrus leafminer colonization and establishment followed the same pattern for both orchards. Minimum and medium temperature and relative humidity were the abiotic factors showing the strongest influence in the numbers of P. citrella mines and larvae.

To date, Wolbachia-induced feminization has been reported only in isopods. Here we report that a Wolbachia strain feminizes an insect host, Ostrinia furnacalis. Among 79 wild females of O. furnacalis examined, Wolbachia infection was detected in 13 females. Twelve of the 13 infected females produced all-female progenies, and this trait was maternally inherited. Tetracycline treatment of thelygenic matrilines resulted in the production of all-male progenies. The present findings indicate that the Wolbachia infection induces feminization of genetic males in O. furnacalis. Differences in the Wolbachia-induced feminization in O. furnacalis and that in isopods are discussed along with the differences in sex determination mechanisms between insects and isopods. Phylogenetic analysis of the wsp gene sequence of Wolbachia suggests independent evolutionary origins for the Wolbachia-induced feminizations in O. furnacalis and in isopods. Our findings over 5 years suggest that the infection has been maintained at a low prevalence in the O. furnacalis population.

Although superficially similar to the cottonwood twig borer, G. haimbachiana (Kearfott), of eastern North America, G. aceriana is easily recognized by its distinctive male genitalia. G. aceriana is a notable pest of Populus (Salacaceae) species and hybrids in plantations and nurseries in Europe, where it is known as the poplar shoot borer. Young larvae mine leaves, and older larvae bore into terminal shoots, often causing gall-like swellings. The species may be established in western Washington State, and could become a significant pest in North America.

The first P450, CYP9A2, was obtained by RT-PCR using degenerate primers. Northern blot analysis of expression in the midgut using the CYP9A2 probe revealed a significant induction by a variety of chemicals. Diets supplemented with the wild tomato compound 2-undecanone caused a dose-dependent induction which peaked after 48 h. Induction was also observed after addition to the diet of indole-3-carbinol, phenobarbital, 2-tridecanone and xanthotoxin. Neither alpha-pinene, clofibrate nor nicotine were effective inducers. The CYP9A2 probe hybridized to two mRNA species, one of 2.0 kb and another of 4.2 kb, suggesting cross-hybridization to other P450 mRNAs. Additional P450 clones of the CYP9 family were then obtained and sequenced. Northern hybridization revealed that the 4.2 kb band also hybridized to CYP9A4 whereas the 2.0 kb hybridized to CYP9A5. Despite being 91% identical, CYP9A4 and CYP9A5 were induced differentially by clofibrate and xanthotoxin. Multiple P450 genes from various families are therefore induced in Lepidoptera in response to plant allelochemicals or xenobiotics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The previous system of naming isolates according to the host and sequence of discovery (IV type 1, IV2, IV3, etc.) is not adequate for the purposes of taxonomy, since iridovirus isolates may infect many species, including hosts from diverse invertebrate orders. The new system of invertebrate iridovirus nomenclature, as with several other virus families, is based on geographical origin. Proposals have been made, based on DNA hybridization and other characteristics, by which invertebrate iridovirus isolates can be assigned to one of four recognized complexes, or considered as candidates for alternative assignations. This study reports comparative data on the DNA of 14 invertebrate iridovirus isolates used in the Williams and Cory study plus the two type vertebrate iridoviruses, frog virus 3 and flounder lymphocystis disease virus. DNA studies support the validity of assigning several isolates a common name and of grouping the known isolates into four complexes. The detection of such complexes is in broad agreement with previous serological studies. A previously undescribed isolate (San Miguel IV) obtained from the lepidopteran pest Anticarsia gemmatalis (Lep.: Noctuidae) has been initially characterized following the procedures recommended by Williams and Cory. DNA hybridization and Southern blot analysis identified this isolate as a new member of the Polyiridovirus complex. The San Miguel IV MSP gene was identified and a central fragment of ca. 719 bp was recovered by PCR amplification. The restriction endonuclease profiles (5 enzymes) of this isolate were distinct from others previously described.

A deeper meaning for shallow-level phylogenomic studies: nested anchored hybrid enrichment offers great promise for resolving the tiger moth tree of life (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Arctiinae)	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							ULTRACONSERVED ELEMENTS; ULTRASONIC SIGNALS; EVOLUTION; COURTSHIP; MARKERS; CLASSIFICATION; MILTOCHRISTA; SYSTEMATICS; PERFORMANCE; DIVERGENCE	Anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) has emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering the evolutionary relationships within many taxonomic groups. AHE probe sets have been developed for a variety of insect groups, though none have yet been shown to be capable of simultaneously resolving deep and very shallow (e.g., intraspecific) divergences. In this study, we present NOC1, a new AHE probe set (730 loci) for Lepidoptera specialized for noctuoids and assess its ability to deliver phylogenetic utility at all taxonomic levels. We test the NOC1 probe set with 142 individuals from 116 species sampled from all the major lineages of Arctiinae (Erebidae), one of the most diverse groups of noctuoids (>11 000 species) for which no well-resolved, strongly supported phylogenetic hypothesis exists. Compared to previous methods, we generally recover much higher branch support (BS), resulting in the most well-supported, well-resolved phylogeny of Arctiinae to date. At the most shallow-levels, NOC1 confidently resolves species-level and intraspecific relationships and potentially uncovers cryptic species diversity within the genus Hypoprepia. We also implement a 'sensitivity analysis' to explore different loci combinations and site sampling strategies to determine whether a reduced probe set can yield results similar to those of the full probe set. At both deep and shallow levels, only 50-175 of the 730 loci included in the complete NOC1 probe set were necessary to resolve most relationships with high confidence, though only when the more rapidly evolving sites within each locus are included. This demonstrates that AHE probe sets can be tailored to target fewer loci without a significant reduction in BS, allowing future studies to incorporate more taxa at a lower per-sample sequencing cost. NOC1 shows great promise for resolving long-standing taxonomic issues and evolutionary questions within noctuoid lineages, one of the most speciose superfamilies within Lepidoptera.

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae); and lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), are lepidopteran pests of corn, Zea mays L., in the southern United States. Blended refuge for transgenic plants expressing the insecticidal protein derivative from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has recently been approved as an alternative resistance management strategy in the northern United States. We conducted a two-year study with 39 experiments across 12 states in the southern United States to evaluate plant injury from these five species of Lepidoptera to corn expressing Cry1F and Cry1Ab, as both single and pyramided traits, a pyramid of Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20, and a pyramid of Cry1F x Cry1Ab plus non-Bt in a blended refuge. Leaf injury and kernel damage from corn earworm and fall armyworm, and stalking tunneling by southwestern corn borer, were similar in Cry1F x Cry1Ab plants compared with the Cry1F x Cry1Ab plus non-Bt blended refuge averaged across five-plant clusters. When measured on an individual plant basis, leaf injury, kernel damage, stalk tunneling (southwestern corn borer), and dead or injured plants (lesser cornstalk borer) were greater in the blended non-Bt refuge plants compared to Cry1F x Cry1Ab plants in the non-Bt and pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab blended refuge treatment. When non-Bt blended refuge plants were compared to a structured refuge of non-Bt plants, no significant difference was detected in leaf injury, kernel damage, or stalk tunneling (southwestern corn borer). Plant stands in the non-Bt and pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab blended refuge treatment had more stalk tunneling from sugarcane borer and plant death from lesser cornstalk borer compared to a pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab structured refuge treatment. Hybrid plants containing Cry1F x Cry1Ab within the pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab blended refuge treatment had significantly less kernel damage than non-Bt structured refuge treatments. Both single and pyramided Bt traits were effective against southwestern corn borer, sugarcane borer, and lesser cornstalk borer.	[Reisig, D.

Fall armyworm has become a growing concern in agricultural communities across the Americas as field populations in many locales have evolved resistance to several Cry1 toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt). An often overlooked aspect of fall armyworm biology is the existence of two host strains, the 'rice' and 'corn' strains. There has been little research devoted to the characterization of fall armyworm host strains, although there is evidence that the rice and corn-strains may differ in their tolerances to Bt toxins expressed by transgenic plants. In this study, diet-based bioassays were conducted to compare the susceptibilities of one rice-strain, two corn-strains, and one rice-corn hybrid population to Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, and Cry1F protein. Results indicate that the corn-strains and hybrid populations are more tolerant to the Bt toxins, especially to Cry1F, than the rice-strain population. Results from this study, when combined with existing techniques for host strain identification, may aid in the development of regional insect resistance management programs for fall armyworm.

Incongruence between morphological and molecular markers in the butterfly genus Zizina (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) in New Zealand	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							COMPLEX LEPIDOPTERA; PHYLOGENY; HYBRIDIZATION; GENITALIA; SEQUENCES	The butterfly genus Zizina in New Zealand has a complex taxonomic history due to the presence of morphological intermediates between the two species, the endemic Z. oxleyi and the introduced Z. labradus, in a putative hybrid zone on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. This makes species identification in the field problematic, particularly as the presence of hybrids has not been confirmed. We address this uncertainty through morphological and molecular analyses. Specimens were collected from a range of locations in New Zealand, as well as from Australia, and measurements were made of male genitalia and ventral wing coloration. Two mitochondrial genes (COI, ND5) and three nuclear gene fragments (28S, ITS2 and wingless) were also sequenced for a selection of individuals, and the presence of Wolbachia species in genomic DNA was tested. The two species were separable in morphological space, although there was some overlap, and the contact zone appeared to be around Kaikoura on the east coast of the South Island. Furthermore, specimens from the putative hybrid zone could be classified as Z. oxleyi using morphological characters individually, but not when these were used in a principal component analysis. Molecular analysis showed that there was a mean sequence divergence of 2.0% between two clades for COI, and 4.1% for ND5, but suggested that the contact zone between them was in the north-west of the South Island. However, there was only a single clade for each of the three nuclear markers. It is thought that this incongruence between morphological and molecular markers is indicative of hybridization which is more extensive than previously thought. However, the possibility that recent speciation has occurred or is occurring is not ruled out.

We investigated the effect of Bt corn on pupal weight, fecundity, and egg viability of H. zea. Pupal weights were significantly reduced for males and females from all Bt hybrids compared with non-Bt near-isolines. Female pupae from the hybrid expressing Cry1F + Cty1Ab were also significantly lighter relative to those from the near-isolines expressing only Cry1F Reductions in pupal weight did not result in any detectable effects on fecundity or egg viability.The reduction in pupal weight in the hybrids expressing Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1Ab significantly declined over time in South Carolina, possibly indicating developing resistance to these Bt toxins. These data can be incorporated into insect resistance management models used to improve risk management decisions regarding H. zea in Bt crops in the complex landscapes of the southern United States.

Monitoring Susceptibility of Western Bean Cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Field Populations to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1F Protein	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						maize pest; field collection; bioassay; tolerance; resistance	CORN; SURVIVAL	Zea mays L. (maize) hybrids producing the Cry1F protein from Bacillus thuringiensis were first commercialized in the United States in 2003. These products demonstrated varying levels of moderate control, but not immunity to Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (western bean cutworm). Susceptibility of western bean cutworm to Cry1F protein was assessed in field populations collected in the mid- and western United States in 2003, 2004, 2013, and 2014 using diet bioassay. A meta-analysis of 32 western bean cutworm field collections assessed for susceptibility to Cry1F was conducted to investigate changes in susceptibility over time. Based on meta-analysis results, these data suggest a 5.2-fold increase in median lethal concentration (LC50) response to Cry1F in the 2013-2014 populations compared with collections that were assessed 10 yr earlier. Widespread use of Cry1F-producing maize hybrids over the past 10 yr may have contributed to favoring western bean cutworm populations with tolerance to the Cry1F protein.

Jean Pourtet) plants were recovered as a result of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation performed with EHA105 pBI-KUN strain. Plasmid pBI-KUN contains a 650 bp insert derived from the soybean (Glycine max L.) KTi3, gene, coding for a Kunitz trypsin proteinase inhibitor. A total of 58 independent transgenic lines were obtained from 200 co-cultivated leaf explants. Southern blot hybridization analysis demonstrated the presence of KTi3 gene in the poplar genome. Northern blot analysis of different kanamycin-resistant plantlets confirmed the accumulation of KTi3 mRNA and revealed different levels of expression. The trypsin inhibitory activity was determined in poplar transgenic tissues by means of specific assay. Moreover, the trypsin-like digestive proteinases of the polyphagous moth Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera, Lymantriidae) and Clostera anastomosis (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae) were detected and inhibited in vitro by Kunitz proteinase inhibitor from selected transgenic plants. Two insect bioassays were performed on P. nigra transgenic plant lines, using larvae of the above mentioned insects. In both cases larval mortality and growth as well as pupal weight were not significantly affected when the insects were fed on transgenic leaves and control leaves, respectively.

Mull, accession PI 134417, on Archytas marmoratus (Townsend) and Eucelatoria bryani (Sabrosky) (Diptera: Tachinidae), both parasitoids of Helicoverpa (= Heliothis) zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were investigated in the laboratory. A. marmoratus deposits larvae (planidia) on the foliage of its host's food plant; planidia attach to passing hosts, penetrate the cuticle, and develop in the host pupae. E. bryani larviposits posits directly into its host; its larvae develop in the host larva. A. marmoratus planidia are killed by glandular trichomes of PI 134417 and also by trichomes of hybrid lines with no methyl ketones. The methyl ketones are toxic to planidia, but at least part of the effect is due to other factors, possibly physical entanglement. Both species can be affected indirectly by methyl ketones in the diet of the host. 2-Undecanone reduces the percentage of A. marmoratus larvae that reach pupation. This effect is evidently due to premature death and desiccation of the host pupa caused by 2-undecanone. 2-Tridecanone in host diets had no effect on A. marmoratus. In E. bryani, 2-tridecanone in the diet of the host reduced the number of parasitoids yielded by each parasitized host, although not the overall percentage of hosts parasitized. 2-Undecanone in the diet of the host had no effect on E. bryani.

Diaphania hyalinata L. and Diaphania nitidalis Cramer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) are among the main pests of plants in the Cucurbitaceae family. Although the importance of social wasps is acknowledged, little is known about their activity as biological control agents in Diaphania spp. Thus, this work aimed to study the natural biological control of the caterpillars D. hyalinata and D. nitidalis by social wasps. We studied the natural biological control of caterpillars of D. hyalinata and D. nitidalis on cucumber hybrids Sprint 440 II and Vlasstar. The main predators of Diaphania caterpillars were the social wasps, followed by Diptera: Syrphidae; Hemiptera: Anthocoridae; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae, Anthicidae; Neuroptera: Chrysopidae and Arachnida: Araneae. Predation of D. hyalinata caterpillars by social wasps was high from the second to fifth instar. The predation of D. nitidalis caterpillars by social wasps was high from the second to fourth instar. There was no predation by social wasps on the first instar larvae of Diaphania spp. The cucumber hybrids did not influence the predation of Diaphania spp. by social wasps. The main social wasp predator of Diaphania spp. was Polybia ignobilis (Haliday). Also, we observed the social wasp Polybia scutellaris (White) preying on D. hyalinata but at low intensity.

Factors reducing oviposition on 'Mp704' in choice tests were not manifested in the one F1 hybrid tested. However, the antibiosis mode of resistance operating within the resistant parent 'Mp704' was generally expressed in the F1 hybrids. The resistant parent and the F1 hybrids showed significantly lower foliar damage ratings as well as stem damage than the susceptible parent against both stem borers under artificial infestation. Larval survival on the F1 hybrids was as low as on 'Mp704'. As measured by nutritional indices, poor food utilization but high relative consumption rate on resistant 'Mp704' and low consumption rate but high food utilization on F1 hybrids resulted in slow development and low biomass gained by C. partellus and B. fusca on these cultivars.

The shortest times to initiation of wing fanning and night occurred at 0.1 lux, the lowest light intensity evaluated. A gradual decrease in light intensity, compared with an instantaneous decrease, prolonged time to Eight. The highest percentage of female night was observed at 0.1 lux. A higher percentage of females initiated flight when exposed to lower light intensities after the onset of normal scotophase rather than before scotophase. Virgin females were less likely to fly than mated females. Females fanned their wings longer at lower temperatures and when they were capable of only a gliding Eight. Females that were night-tested the sane day they emerged tended to take longer to initiate flight than those 1-2 d old. At 0.1 lux, the majority of the Asian females, less than 2% of the F-1 hybrid females, and none of the North American females exhibited strong, directed flight. Over half of the F-1 hybrids glided for a few meters while flapping their wings, whereas none of the North American females exhibited even this level of flight. Thus, female night capability will be reduced when flighted and nonflighted forms initially hybridize.

Cryptic Plutella species show deep divergence despite the capacity to hybridize	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Plutella australiana; Plutella xylostella; Lepidoptera; hybridization; sympatric; insecticide resistance; Wolbachia	XYLOSTELLA LEPIDOPTERA PLUTELLIDAE; DNA-SEQUENCING DATA; DIAMONDBACK MOTH; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; HYMENOPTERA-ICHNEUMONIDAE; DARWINS COROLLARY; RELIABLY IDENTIFY; HOST MTDNA; SEX-RATIO; R PACKAGE	Background: Understanding genomic and phenotypic diversity among cryptic pest taxa has important implications for the management of pests and diseases. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L., has been intensively studied due to its ability to evolve insecticide resistance and status as the world's most destructive pest of brassicaceous crops. The surprise discovery of a cryptic species endemic to Australia, Plutella australiana Landry & Hebert, raised questions regarding the distribution, ecological traits and pest status of the two species, the capacity for gene flow and whether specific management was required. Here, we collected Plutella from wild and cultivated brassicaceous plants from 75 locations throughout Australia and screened 1447 individuals to identify mtDNA lineages and Wolbachia infections. We genotyped genome-wide SNP markers using RADseq in coexisting populations of each species. In addition, we assessed reproductive compatibility in crossing experiments and insecticide susceptibility phenotypes using bioassays. Results: The two Plutella species coexisted on wild brassicas and canola crops, but only 10% of Plutella individuals were P. australiana. This species was not found on commercial Brassica vegetable crops, which are routinely sprayed with insecticides. Bioassays found that P. australiana was 19-306 fold more susceptible to four commonly-used insecticides than P. xylostella. Laboratory crosses revealed that reproductive isolation was incomplete but directionally asymmetric between the species. However, genome-wide nuclear SNPs revealed striking differences in genetic diversity and strong population structure between coexisting wild populations of each species. Nuclear diversity was 1.5-fold higher in P. australiana, yet both species showed limited variation in mtDNA. Infection with a single Wolbachia subgroup B strain was fixed in P. australiana, suggesting that a selective sweep contributed to low mtDNA diversity, while a subgroup A strain infected just 1.5% of P. xylostella. Conclusions: Despite sympatric distributions and the capacity to hybridize, strong genomic and phenotypic divergence exists between these Plutella species that is consistent with contrasting colonization histories and reproductive isolation after secondary contact. Although P. australiana is a potential pest of brassicaceous crops, it is of secondary importance to P. xylostella.

(Poaceae)]. A strain of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), obtained from field collections throughout the central US Corn Belt in 1996 was selected in the laboratory for resistance to Cry1F by exposure to the toxin incorporated into artificial diet. The selected strain developed more than 3000-fold resistance to Cry1F after 35 generations of selection and readily consumed Cry1F expressing maize tissue; yet, it was as susceptible to Cry1Ab and Cry9C as the unselected control strain. Only a low level of cross-resistance (seven-fold) to Cry1Ac was observed. These lacks of cross-resistance between Cry1F and Cry1Ab suggest that maize hybrids expressing these two toxins are likely to be compatible for resistance management of O. nubilalis.

Strains of H. virescens, H. subflexa, and the reciprocal F-1 hybrids (SV0 and VS0) were each offered a choice of four plants on which to oviposit (cotton, soybean, tobacco, and Physalis angulata). Host preferences were ranked basel oil the proportion of eggs laid on each host. H. virescens overwhelmingly preferred tobacco, H. subflexa preferred Physalis and SV0 and VS0 preferred tobacco. There were no significant differences among strains in their responses to cotton and soybean. Because SV0 and VS0 had similar patterns of preference across hosts, there was no indication of sex linkage. Niche breadth, a measure of the degree of specialization, was calculated for each strain. Under greenhouse conditions, H. virescens had the narrowest ovipositional niche and H. subflexa and the hybrids had broader niches and were similar to each other. When a novel host (Oenothera sp.) was offered to the strains, there was no difference in the responses along strains nor were there changes in preference ranks or diet breadth. The hybrid, despite a major genetic reorganization relative to the parents, did not behave in an unpredictable way.

BACK TO THE FUTURE: UPDATES ON THE INVASION HISTORY OF JUNONIA BUTTERFLIES IN FLORIDA AND THE MYSTERY OF CHOKOLOSKEE	JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY			English	Article						Invasion biology; Junonia zonalis; museum specimen DNA; hybridization; biogeography	MUSEUM SPECIMENS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENUS JUNONIA; DNA BARCODES; AMPLIFICATION; TAXONOMY; INSECTS	The tropical buckeye, Junonia zonalis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) is a recent addition to the butterfly fauna of mainland Florida. It appears that this species began to invade the mainland from the Florida Keys or Cuba by the 1930s, hybridizing with J. coenia and bringing with it mitochondrial haplotype group A, which is common in the Caribbean but is essentially absent from North American Junonia. By the 1940s, J. zonalis appears to have established populations in Miami, but eventually may have been extirpated. Later, new populations of J. zonalis may have become established on mainland Florida by subsequent waves of J. zonalis migrants. Substantial fluctuations in both population size and mitochondrial haplotype group A frequency seem to be characteristic of Florida mainland populations of J. zonalis. Populations of J. zonalis in the Florida Keys and Cuba have maintained nearly constant mitochondrial haplotype group A frequencies over many decades and may be more stable than those on the Florida mainland. Junonia zonalis specimens attributed to Chokoloskee, Florida, from the early 1900s have questionable provenance. Based on their haplotype frequency and other evidence these Chokoloskee specimens may have been collected in Cuba. Similarly, one specimen of J. zonalis likely collected during the 1880s and labeled "Indian River, Fla." probably also originated from outside of Florida.	[Lalonde, Melanie M.

Based on morphology, it has been considered a valid species or a hybrid between Mesapamea secalis (Linnaeus) and Mesapamea didyma (Esper). We studied this case of uncertain identity by using traditional Sanger sequencing techniques (COI and seven nuclear genes) as well as double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing, which resulted in analyses including 9402 loci and 1 512 976 bp across the genome. Our analyses showed that genomic data do not support the hybrid hypothesis and that M. remmi is not separated genetically from M. secalis; both are clearly distinct from M. didyma. Reproductive organs of M. remmi males are unique and diagnosable, whereas females are teratological in the sense that ductus seminalis is missing and corpus bursae is malformed, the latter being connected directly to the ovipore. These data support the view that M. remmi is not a valid species and we consider M. remmi Rezbanyai-Reser, 1985 to be a junior synonym of M. secalis (Linnaeus, 1758). We demonstrate that genomic approaches provide an efficient way to address various difficult and long-standing taxonomic issues, in this case oversplitting of species.

Dispersal Behavior of Neonate European Corn Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) on Bt Corn	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						European corn borer; Bt corn; resistance management; blended-seed refuge; dispersal	HELIOTHIS-ZEA LARVAE; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; INSECT RESISTANCE; EXPRESSING CRY1AB; SELF-SELECTION; SEED MIXTURES; FIELD CORN; SURVIVAL; EVOLUTION; INSTARS	European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), has historically been a significant economically important insect pest of corn (Zea mays L.) in the United States and Canada. The development in the 1990s of genetically modified corn expressing genes derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that encodes insecticidal crystalline (Cry) proteins has proven to be effective in controlling this insect as well as other corn pests. The purpose of this study was to assess the movement and dispersal behavior of neonate European corn borer on Bt corn. We examined differences in neonate European corn borer dispersal behavior for the first 4 h after eclosion in the field among a stacked pyramid (Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Cry34/35Ab1) Bt corn, a Cry1F Bt corn, and a non-Bt sweet corn; and in the laboratory among a Bt corn hybrid containing Cry1F, a hybrid containing Cry1Ab, a pyramid combining these two hybrids (Cry1F x Cry1Ab), and a non-Bt near isoline corn. In field experiments, we found that dispersal was significantly higher on Bt corn compared with sweet corn. In laboratory experiments, dispersal was significantly higher on Cry1Ab Bt corn and Cry1F x Cry1Ab Bt corn than on non-Bt near isoline corn. Results indicated that neonate dispersal may be significantly greater in Bt cornfields compared with non-Bt cornfields. The findings on dispersal behavior in this study will be useful in evaluating the efficacy of a blended seed refuge system for managing European corn borer resistance in Bt corn.	[Razze, J.

Host-plant preference for cotton [Gossypium arboreum L. (Malvaceae)] and pepper [Capsicum frutescens L. (Solanaceae)] of fifth-instar caterpillars was tested by using a two-choice leaf-disk assay. Helicoverpa armigera and H. assulta were significantly different in their feeding preferences, but the difference was not significant in the reciprocal hybrids, which showed there were no maternal/cytoplasmic effects. Comparisons of feeding preference between different groups of females or males demonstrated that the trait was not controlled by sex-linked loci. The distributions of feeding preference index values for crosses that carried similar complements of autosomal genes were not significantly different, whereas crosses with different complements of autosomal genes were associated with significantly different feeding preferences, indicating that feeding preference of the two species for cotton and pepper, respectively, is controlled by autosomal genes. It was found that one major autosomal locus affected this feeding preference, with the H. armigera-derived alleles being partially dominant to those carried by H. assulta. The genetic analysis of hybrids contributes to understand the evolution of feeding preference in these closely related species.

Previous studies reported that egg deposition on maize landraces induces the release of volatiles that attract parasitoids, but little is known on the effect of these volatiles on subsequent herbivore oviposition. In addition, larval preference and development on these maize landraces is unknown. We evaluated six landraces and one hybrid maize variety for their resistance to Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Larval orientation, settling, arrest and dispersal, feeding, development, survival, and subsequent oviposition of moths were determined for individuals reared on each of these varieties under laboratory and screen house conditions. For oviposition preference studies, all treatments were initially exposed to egg deposition whereas the control treatments were not. Larval preference was generally higher for hybrid maize, compared to the landraces. Similarly, first-instar feeding on maize leaves was more intense in hybrid maize than in four of the six landraces. The amount of food consumed and assimilated by third instars over a 24-h period was, however, not different among the maize varieties. Larval survival was significantly lower in maize landraces (32%) compared to hybrid maize (54%). However, there was no difference in the larval development period between any of the treatments. Two-choice oviposition assays showed that moths preferred non-exposed maize landraces for subsequent oviposition, whereas in the hybrid, there was no difference in oviposition preference between exposed and non-exposed plants. Although the mechanism of larval suppression was beyond the scope of this study, it was inferred that the landraces showed some resistance to C.partellus feeding and that initial egg deposition on these landraces deters further colonisation by the herbivore.

The effects of tillage systems on the growth, grain yield and resistance of maize hybrids against fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), sugarcane borer (SCB), Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius and southwestern corn borer (SWCB), Diatraea grandiosella (Dyar) were examined. Four single cross hybrids used were: Ki3 x CML139 (resistant), Ki3 x CML131 (susceptible), CML67 x CML135 (resistant) and Ki3 x CML69 (susceptible). These hybrids were sown on land with conventional tillage, minimum tillage and zero tillage, with and without mulch, in infested and insecticide-protected plots. The resistance/susceptibility of these hybrids against FAW, SCB and SWCB was not altered by the tillage systems. Hybrids planted under zero-tillage +mulch suffered significantly higher damage by SCB and FAW probably because of the retention of moisture in the mulch, which provided optimum conditions for larval feeding. Damage by SWCB on hybrids was the same in different tillage systems because of relatively dry conditions prevailing in the trial. Grain yield of the four hybrids was generally higher in zero-tilled plots in comparison to conventional or minimum tillage systems. These observations support the use of zero-tillage for maize production. Data also show that FAW infestation at 4-5 leaf stage caused grain yield reduction of 10-13% across all tillage systems in the tropical environment but in a subtropical environment, yield reduction was only 1-2%. Grain yield of the hybrids Ki3 x CML139 and Ki3 x CML69 was affected by SCB infestation in all the tillage systems but that of CML67 x 135 and Ki3 x CML131 was not affected. SWCB infestation on the hybrid Ki3 x CML131 was less in the infested plots but that of remaining hybrids was the same in infested and protected plots in different tillage systems. Thus, zero-tillage can be used on community-wide basis to prevent the soil erosion and save our dwindled soil resources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) and Helicoverpazea (Boddie). The Bt hybrids tested were developed by Novartis Seeds, using tale event BT-11, which expresses Bt toxin in green tissue as well as reproductive tissues including the tassel, silk, and kernel. Bt hybrids were compared with a standard non-Bt control or tale non-Bt isoline for each hybrid; none of the hybrids were treated with insecticides during the study. Hybrid efficacy was based on larval control of each pest, as well as plant or ear damage associated with each pest. In both ears, control of O. nubilalis larvae in primary ears of all Bt hybrids was 99-100% compared with the appropriate non-Bt check. Plant damage was also significantly. reduced in all Bt hybrids. In 1996, control of H. zea in Bt hybrids ranged from 85 to 88% when compared with the appropriate non-Bt control. In 1996, a University of Minnesota experimental compared with the appropriate non-Bt control. In 1996, a University non-Bt hybrid (MN2 X MN3) performed as well as the Bt hybrids for control of O. nubilalis. Also. in 1996, two additional University of Minnesota experimental non-Bt hybrids (A684su X MN94 and MN2 X MN3) performed as well as Bt hybrids for percent marketable ears (ears with no damage or larvae). In addition, compared with the non-Bt hybrids, percent marketable ears were significantly higher for all Bt hybrids and in most cases ranged from 98 to 100%. By comparison, percent marketable ears for the non-Bt hybrids averaged 45.5 and 37.4% in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Results from the 2-yr study strongly suggest that Bt sweet corn hybrids will provide high levels of larval control for growers in both fresh and processing markets. Specifically, Bt sweet corn hybrids, in the absence of conventional insecticide use, provided excellent control of O. nubilalis, and very good control of H. zea. However, depending on location of specific production regions, anti the associated insect pests of sweet corn in each area, some insecticide applications may still be necessary.

HPLC and ELISA were used to measure fumonisin levels. Results of the methods were highly correlated, but ELISA estimates were higher. Bt hybrids experienced less insect injury, Fusarium ear rot, and fumonisin contamination compared to non-Bt hybrids. WBC infestation increased fumonisin content compared to natural infestation in non-Bt and hybrids expressing Cry1Ab protein in five of eight possible comparisons; in Cry1F hybrids, WBC did not impact fumonisins. These results indicate that WBC is capable of increasing fumonisin levels in maize. Under WBC infestation, Cry1F mitigated this risk more consistently than Cry1Ab or non-Bt hybrids. Transgenically expressed Bt proteins active against multiple lepidopteran pests can provide broad, consistent reductions in the risk of fumonisin contamination.

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae), becomes less responsive to conventional control methods. Resistance of genetically modified maize hybrids 'Agrisure (TM) 3000 GT' and 'Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111' were evaluated against stalk borers and compared with conventional hybrids with or without insecticide. During evaluation, few borers were found, especially during the first year (2012), but, in most cases, stalk damage by larvae was less in Agrisure (TM) 3000 GT and Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111 than in their conventional isolines. Insecticide did not prevent damage by the pest and even treated conventional maize was damaged. Use of Agrisure (TM) 3000 GT and Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111 hybrids can be a management tool to prevent damage by sugarcane borer in maize.

The structural genes (cryIA) encoding the Lepidoptera-specific toxin from different bacterial strains diverage primarily in a single hypervariable region, whereas the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the proteins are highly conserved. In this report, we describe the generation of hybrid genes between two cryIA genes. Two truncated cryIA genes were cloned in a plasmid vector in such way as to have only the hypervariable region in common. The two truncated cryIA genes were separated by the tetracycline-resistance determinant (or part of it). In vivo recombination between the hypervariable regions of the cryIA genes reconstituted an entire hybrid cryIA gene. Direct sequence analysis of 17 recombinant plasmids identified eleven different crossover regions which did not alter the reading frame and allowed the production of eight different hybrid proteins. The recombination events were independent from the RecA function of Escherichia coli. Some of the hybrid gene products were more specific in their insecticidal action and one had acquired a new biological activity.

Relative susceptibility of sunflower maintainer lines and resistance sources to natural infestations of the banded sunflower moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							HOMOEOSOMA-ELECTELLUM HULST; GROWTH-STAGES; COCHYLIDAE; LARVAE; PERFORMANCE; HELIANTHUS; ASTERACEAE; ASTERALES; PYRALIDAE; DAMAGE	The banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes Walsingham (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a significant seed-feeding pest of sunflowers (Helianthus Linnaeus; Asteraceae) in North America. Though some wild Helianthus, interspecific crosses, and H. annuus Linnaeus cultivars (which precede hybrid sunflower breeding) have low susceptibility to banded sunflower moth, no apparent effort has been made to evaluate modern inbred lines as a source of resistance for hybrids. In field trials from 2013 to 2015, inbred maintainer (HA) lines, resistant accessions (PI), and unreleased, partially inbred (F-6) lines were evaluated in field trials using natural infestations of banded sunflower moth. Results show greater seed damage to maintainer lines than the other groups, but also significant variability among lines within groups. The best maintainer, HA 207, had approximate to 75% fewer damaged seed than the most susceptible HA lines. Among the resistant PI and unreleased inbred lines, only one entry had significantly less damage than HA 207. While PI 494859 showed banded moth resistance superior to the best inbred lines, its other agronomic liabilities make breeding with the least susceptible maintainer lines appear more practical. A key unknown for any attempts to breed hybrids resistant to banded sunflower moth is how closely damage is correlated between inbred lines and their hybrids.

It has previously been established that glycoproteins in the midgut microvillar membrane of insects are targets for toxins produced by different organisms as well as plant lectins. However, there is still little information about the N-glycome of membrane-bound midgut glycoproteins in Lepidoptera and other insect groups. The present study used mass spectrometry-based approaches to characterize the N-glycoproteins present in the midgut cell microvilli of Spodoptera frugiperda. We subjected midgut cell microvilli proteins to proteolytic digestion and enriched the resulting glycopeptides prior to analysis. We also performed endoglycosidase release of N-glycans in the presence of (H2O)-O-18 determining the compositions of released N-glycans by MALDI-TOF MS analysis and established the occupancy of the potential N-glycosylation sites. We report here a total of 160 glycopeptides, representing 25 N-glycan compositions associated with 70 sites on 35 glycoproteins. Glycan compositions consistent with oligomannose, paucimannose and complex/hybrid N-glycans represent 35, 30 and 35% of the observed glycans, respectively. The two most common N-glycan compositions were the complex/hybrid Hex(3)HexNAc(4)dHex(4) and the paucimannose structure that contains only the doubly-fucosylated trimannosylchitobiose core Hex(3)HexNAc(2)dHex(2), each appearing in 22 occupied sites (13.8%). These findings enlighten aspects of the glycobiology of lepidopteran midgut microvilli.

Host plant-related variation in thermal tolerance of Eldana saccharina	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						lethal temperature; chill-coma; stalk borer; Cyperus papyrus; sugarcane; microclimate; Lepidoptera; Pyralidae; Saccharum hybrids	WALKER LEPIDOPTERA; DROSOPHILA; PHYSIOLOGY; LIMITS; TEMPERATURE; POPULATIONS; COLLEMBOLA; MANAGEMENT; EXTREMES; INSECTS	Understanding tolerance of thermal extremes by pest insects is essential for developing integrated management strategies, as tolerance traits can provide insights into constraints on activity and survival. A major question in thermal biology is whether thermal limits vary systematically with microclimate variation, or whether other biotic or abiotic factors can influence these limits in a predictable manner. Here, we report the results of experiments determining thermal limits to activity and survival at extreme temperatures in the stalk borer Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), collected from either Saccharum spp. hybrids (sugarcane) (Poaceae) or Cyperus papyrus L. (Cyperaceae) and then reared under standard conditions in the laboratory for 1-2 generations. Chill-coma temperature (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), lower lethal temperatures (LLT), and freezing temperature between E.saccharina collected from the two host plants were compared. CTmin and CTmax of E.saccharina moths collected from sugarcane were significantly lower than those from C.papyrus (CTmin=2.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C; CTmax=44.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 44.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C). By contrast, LLT of moths and freezing temperatures of pupae did not vary with host plant [LLT for 50% (LT50) of the moth population, when collected from sugarcane: -3.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C, from C.papyrus: -3.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C]. Freezing temperatures of pupae collected from C.papyrus were -18.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C and of those from sugarcane -17.5 +/- 1.8 degrees C. The E.saccharina which experienced the lowest minimum temperature (in C.papyrus) did not have the lowest CTmin, although the highest estimate of CTmax was found in E.saccharina collected from C.papyrus and this was also the microsite which reported the highest maximum temperatures. These results therefore suggest that host plant may strongly mediate lower critical thermal limits, but not necessarily LLT or freezing temperatures. These results have significant implications for ongoing pest management and thermal biology of these and other insects.

A choice test compared oviposition on the peach scion 'Harvester', peach rootstock 'Guardian', plum x peach hybrid rootstock 'MP-29', and the plum hybrid rootstock 'Sharpe'. A significantly lower percentage of eggs occurred on limbs of Sharpe rootstock than other choices. A choice test using two endemic hosts, black cherry (P. serotina Ehrh.) and Chickasaw plum (P. angustifolia Marsh.), along with Sharpe rootstock, found a lower percentage of eggs on limbs of Sharpe than either endemic host. However, when only limbs of Sharpe and a decoy were used, almost all eggs were laid on Sharpe. Interestingly, when Harvester and Sharpe limbs were paired side by side, a higher percentage of eggs were recovered from the Harvester limb than from the Sharpe limb. An analysis of volatiles from Sharpe may identify why fewer eggs were laid on it. Because S. pictipes attacks host trees above ground and Sharpe rootstock on grafted trees grows below ground, this rootstock might be a management option against the congeneric, root-attacking peachtree borer, S. exitiosa (Say). Our results suggest that high budding a peach scion onto Sharpe rootstock, thus allowing the rootstock to serve as the trunk, warrants further investigation against S. exitiosa under orchard conditions.

It is believed that generalists owe their success to the deployment of various members of multigene families of detoxification and digestive enzymes, a strategy that may also be responsible for rapid evolution of insecticide resistance. However, studies of generalist adaptations have been limited to specific genes or gene families, and an overview of how these adaptations are orchestrated at the transcriptional level is lacking. We used Drosophila melanogaster Meigen gene homology to H. armigera-expressed sequence tags to identify key groups of genes and pathways differentially regulated in the gut of fifth instars after 2 days of feeding on a variety of food sources. A series of microarray hybridizations was performed following two alternating loop designs, one comparing the gut gene expression upon feeding on various hosts (cotton, bean, tobacco, and chickpea) and two artificial diets (pinto bean and wheat germ-based), whereas the second design compared the gut expression toward feeding on various plant structures within cotton (leaf, square, and boll). The transcriptional responses toward bean and tobacco feeding treatments were more closely related in comparison with the rest of the diets, whereas the gene expression profiles toward cotton leaf and square-feeding were highly similar. We furthermore found significant changes in several pathways not directly responsible for detoxification mechanisms. Genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism, environmental information processing, and cellular processes were found to be differentially expressed. In addition, regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and the extracellular matrix-receptor pathways appeared differentially regulated across feeding treatments. Three cytochrome P450 genes CYP6AE17, CYP6B6, and CYP9A17 grouped as part of a xenobiotic metabolism pathway, were up-regulated in the bean-feeding treatment, and down-regulated in both tobacco and cotton-feeding treatments. CYP4L11, CYP4L5, and CYP4S13 were differentially expressed upon feeding on different cotton plant structures. The present work provides host plant and plant structure-specific transcriptional responses in a lepidopteran herbivore, including pathways and gene candidates for future studies of H. armigera physiology under a more integrative ecologically meaningful framework.

Development, survival, and feeding behavior of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) relative to Bt protein concentrations in corn ear tissues	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; TRANSGENIC CORN; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; INSECT RESISTANCE; TOBACCO BUDWORM; FIELD CORN; COTTON; TOXIN; MAIZE; CANNIBALISM	The corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), preferentially oviposits and feeds on ears of corn (Zea mays L.) and can be managed using transgenic hybrids that produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Concentrations of Bt proteins can vary spatially and temporally in plant tissues, creating a heterogeneous environment that can increase the risk of resistance development. We planted small-plot trials of nine Bt and non-Bt corn hybrids in South Carolina in 2016 and 2017 and investigated the development, survival, feeding injury, and feeding behavior in corn ear tissues. ELISA was used to quantify the concentrations of Cry1F and Cry2Ab2 in young silk, old silk, maternal tip tissue, kernels, and husk. Cry1F and Cry2Ab2 significantly varied with silk age and both proteins were generally highest in the silk and tip tissue. Hybrids with pyramided proteins significantly reduced feeding injury to the silk, tip, and kernel ear tissues, which was less apparent with single Bt protein hybrids. The pyramided hybrid expressing Vip3A incurred no injury to either the ear tip or kernels, and only eight 1st instar larvae were collected in the silk of 520 sampled ears. Age of larvae significantly varied among ear tissues but not between hybrids. Depending on hybrid family, mean larval instar in the silk, tip, and kernels was 1st or 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, respectively. Instar-specific feeding penetrance into corn ears increased with age but did not differ between hybrids. We characterized the instar- and tissue-specific feeding behavior of H. zea larvae but did not detect differences in feeding behavior between Bt and non-Bt hybrids. Implications for resistance management strategies such as seed mixtures are discussed.	[Bilbo, Tom R.; Reay-Jones, Francis P.

Although the hybrid kernels contained 20 times less of the Cry1Ab toxin than leaves, they had been shown to be toxic to some stored product pests, indicating a protective effect of Cry1Ab during maize storage. However, the characterization of the resistance level and benefits of the Cry1Ab kernels during their storage are still incomplete. In this study, we compared the suppressive effect of the diets obtained from the MON 810-YieldGard (R) hybrid to four species of stored product moths: Ephestia kuehniella, Ephestia elutella, Cadra cautella and Plodia interpunctella. The diets originated from kernels that were obtained at two different experimental fields containing the same concentration of Cry1Ab (0.35 +/- 0.056 mu g g(-1)), and caused 100% mortality in E. ellutella, C. cautella and P. interpunctella, and 65% mortality in E. kuehniella. The comparison of LD50 (time when 50% individuals died) and larval relative growth rate (RGR) among the tested species revealed that P. interpunctella was the most sensitive species followed by E. elutella, C cautella and E. kuehniella. The lowest toxic concentration of Cry1Ab in the diet of E kuehniella larvae was determined by mixing the diets from hybrid kernels containing Cry1Ab with diets from control kernels without Cry1Ab. The mortality of E. kuehniella larvae decreased with decreasing Cry1Ab concentration, and the LD50 (concentration when 50% individuals died) was 0.20 mu g Cry1A g(-1) of diet. Similarly, the larval RGR decreased with decreasing logarithmically transformed concentrations of Cry1Ab in the diet. These results show that MON 810-YieldGard (R) hybrid kernels are protected during their storage against feeding by stored product moths. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Throughout species range, mating pattern varies and reproductive barriers are also not fixed among different species. In this study, two instances of interspecific mating between two widely common Nymphalid Tiger butterflies (Danaus Kluk, 1780) in Indian region are reported. Observations imply lack of absolute reproductive barriers, where possible interplay exists among prezygotic and postzygotic isolating factors compensating each other in order to restrain interspecific hybridization.

To better understand the inheritance patterns and expression of transgenes, two genes (sporamin and chitinase PjChi-1) in T-1 progeny of four single-copy T-0 transformants were characterized. PCR detection revealed that the segregation ratio was 3 : 1 for tested plants of each T-0 transformant, which agreed with the Mendelian rules. In RT-PCR analysis, 10 positive progeny plants of T-0-11 line showed a stable expression of sporamin and PjChi-1 but not in wild type. Moreover, a higher expression level of sporamin gene in T-1-11-3 was confirmed compared to the other progeny plants using Northern blot hybridization technique. Artificial inoculation of 10 plants (T-1-11) with Lepidoptera larvae (Plutella xylostella) and fungus (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) in in vitro bioassays showed significant resistance compared to the wild type. Progeny T-1-11-3 showed the stronger resistance, which was consistent with the higher expression level of sporamin gene in Northern blot hybridization detection, whereas there was no difference in insect and fungi resistance among these positive T-1-11 plants. These results indicate that both combined genes have been inherited from parental transformants to their progeny and showed a consistent resistance to insect and fungus in all positive T-1 progeny.

In this study, a binary vector carrying sporamin and chitinase PjChi-1 genes in tandem was introduced into Brassica napus cv. ZS 758 via Agrobacterium tumefaciens for dual resistance against disease and insect attack. Thirty-two regenerated plantlets exhibiting hygromycin resistance were selected following Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of 600 leaf petiole explants. Of these, 27 transformants were confirmed to carry the two transgenes as detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 4.5% transformation efficiency. Eight plantlets were randomly selected for further confirmation by Southern and northern blot hybridization analyses. Four plants carried single copy of the transgenes, while the remaining four plants carried either two or three copies of the transgenes. Moreover, expression of the sporamin transgene was detected by northern blot hybridization in transgenic lines, but not in wild-type plants. These eight T(0) plants were grown in vitro, and inoculated with the Lepidoptera larvae of Plutella xylostella and with spores of the fungal pathogen of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Transgenic plants exhibited high levels of resistance to P. xylostella and S. sclerotiorum when compared to untransformed wild-type plants. Genetic analysis of T(1) progeny confirmed Mendelian segregation of the introduced genes. Therefore, these transgenic lines demonstrate a promising potential for variety development of oilseed rape lines with enhanced resistance against both P. xylostella and S. sclerotiorum.

As an initial step in documenting the genetic complexity underlying such shifts, we characterized the behavioral responses of hybrid male moths created by mating two heliothine moth species, Heliothis subflexa and Heliothis virescens. Between 67 and 96% of hybrid males flew upwind and contacted the pheromone source when presented with a blend consisting of (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald), (Z)-9-hexadecenal (Z9-16:Ald), and (Z)-11-hexadecenol (Z11-16:OH) in a 1:0.5: 0.1 ratio that has previously been shown to be attractive to H. subflexa males. In addition, an H virescens blend of Z11-16:Ald and (Z)-9-tetradecenal (Z9-14:Ald) enhanced by the addition of Z11-16:OH (in a 1:0.05:0.1 mixture) was attractive to hybrid males (26-64% source contact), but significantly fewer males reached the odor source compared to the blend containing Z9-16:Ald. A blend in which the dosage of Z9-14:Ald was doubled, however, was equally attractive (75-77% source contact) as the Z9-16:Ald-containing blend. Consecutive presentation of two blends revealed that individual hybrid males responded equally well to blends containing either Z9-14:Ald or Z9-16:Ald. Together these results suggest that in addition to Z11-16:Ald, hybrid males: (1) required either Z9-16:Ald (like H. subflexa males) or Z9-14:Ald (like H. virescens males); (2) required the presence of Z11-16:OH (H. subflexa dominant); (3) were not adversely affected by the presence of Z11-16:Ac (H. subflexa dominant). The behavioral response phenotype of hybrid males was therefore influenced by genetic factors inherited from both parental species. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Inheritance of female flight in Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera : Lymantriidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						female flight propensity; hybrids; Lymantria dispar; dispersal; inheritance	GYPSY MOTHS LEPIDOPTERA; NORTH-AMERICA; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM; POPULATIONS; RUSSIA	A clinal female flight polymorphism exists in the gypsy moth, Lymantria disparL., where female flight diminishes from east to west across Eurasia. A Russian population where females are capable of sustained ascending flight and a North American population with females incapable of flight were crossed: parentals, reciprocal F, hybrids, double reciprocal F, hybrids, and all possible back-crosses to both the parental lines were compared. Heritabilities were estimated using a threshold model, female offspring on female parent regressions, and joint-scaling analyses. Heritability of female flight capability measured using a free flight test was at least 0.60, and variation in wing size, muscle strength, and flight behaviors contributed to the flight polymorphism. Relative wing size varied continuously and had a heritability of 0.70. Environmental variation accounted for > 90% of the variation in female preflight weight and relative flight muscle strength, as estimated by an inverted female's ability to right herself. Preflight walking behavior and early deposition of eggs were each inherited through a single gene with two co-dominant alleles. There was no evidence for sex-linkage or maternal effects in female flight capability or associated traits. Continued vigilance to exclude and eradicate introductions of strains capable of female flight in North America is warranted even in areas where no females fly, because some of the alleles needed for full flight capability may not be present in the North American populations, and some flight capability is maintained in the hybrids that could increase the rate of spread of L. dispar.

Phylogeography and counter-intuitive inferences in island biogeography: evidence from morphometric markers in the mobile butterfly Maniola jurtina (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						dispersal; geometric morphometrics; hybrid zones; Pleistocene; refugia; West Mediterranean	DENSITY-DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS; MESSINIAN SALINITY CRISIS; TUSCAN ARCHIPELAGO; BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; RECENT GEOGRAPHY; SPECIES RICHNESS; LATE MIOCENE; PATTERNS; DIFFERENTIATION; HYBRIDIZATION	Distribution of mobile organisms on near-continent islands is mainly shaped by factors operating over ecological rather geological time. However, the phylogeography of single species has the potential to expose historical factors at work. In the present study, West Mediterranean populations of the butterfly Maniola jurtina are studied using geometric morphometrics. The distribution of the two well established lineages (Maniola jurtina jurtina in the Atlanto-Mediterranean area and Maniola jurtina janira in the Central-Eastern-Mediterranean area) on 12 islands and the adjoining continents are compared. The south-western lineage unexpectedly occurs on islands close to shores occupied by the eastern lineage. We have modelled the distribution of the lineages using three different hypotheses: (1) a contemporary isolation model, which predicts lineage occupancy of islands is linked to relative distances from neighbouring continental areas; (2) a refugial hypothesis, which predicts one lineage to be the ancestral one for the whole region studied, and then successively replaced over part of it; (3) a changing geography hypothesis, which predicts the two lineages to have evolved in their currently occupied areas, continuously sourcing islands subsequent to the Wurm maximum glaciation. Of the three models, the refugial hypothesis is most highly correlated with the observed pattern, suggesting that Mediterranean islands may function as refugia during cold periods, much as the three mainland peninsulas of Iberia, Italy and Greece are known to have done. Thereafter, hybridization on the nearest and smallest islands has occurred, with the entire process supporting the notion of the joint influence of factors in ecological and geological time.

Bacillus thuringiensis Resistance Influences European Corn Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) Larval Behavior After Exposure to Cry1Ab	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						behavioral resistance; feeding; dispersal; insect resistance management; transgenic	HELIOTHIS-VIRESCENS LEPIDOPTERA; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; DELTA-ENDOTOXIN; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS; INSECT RESISTANCE; TRANSGENIC CORN; SEED MIXTURES; MOTH LARVAE; PYRALIDAE	The behavior of pests targeted by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops has been recognized as an important factor to define resistance management plans. However, most data do not include the possible impact resistance may have on the behavior of pests. To examine whether resistance influences behavior of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), neonates after exposure to dietary Bt, the responses of Cry1Ab-resistant, -susceptible, and hybrid (F1) lines from two populations were compared in laboratory tests by using artificial diet mixed with 10-50% Cry1Ab or non-Bt isoline corn, Zea mays L., tissue. In no-choice tests, resistant (and usually hybrid) lines were less likely to be irritated (i.e., to move away after physical contact with diet containing Cry1Ab) than susceptible larvae after exposure to diets containing 10-50% Cry1Ab leaf tissue. Early in the no-choice tests (8 h), neonate O. nubilalis also were more likely to move off of diets that contained 10% non-Bt tissue compared with diets with 25 or 50% non-Bt tissue. In agreement with results from no-choice tests, choice tests with 10 or 25% tissue indicated that resistant (and sometimes hybrid) larvae were more likely than susceptible neonates to be found on diet with Cry1Ab. For choice tests, differences among lines seemed dependent on the amount of Cry1Ab tissue incorporated into diets. Results suggest differences in behavior are a result of reduced physiological susceptibility to Cry1Ab and are not an independent behavioral component to resistance.	[Prasifka, J. R.; Hellmich, R.

Smith 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is the most important corn pest in South America. Larvae feed mostly on leaves, but also ears when population densities are high. This pest has been historically controlled with insecticide applications, but many cases of resistance have limited their efficacy. Transgenic corn varieties expressing Bacillus thuringiensis proteins (Bt corn) have been a widely adopted alternative to insecticides and, in the past 8 yr, have been the primary technology for fall armyworm control in Brazil. Because transgenic varieties require 10-15 yr to be developed and fall armyworm has quickly evolved resistance to most commercially released Bt corn hybrids, strategies for Bt trait durability are paramount. Most of the Bt corn hybrids lost their ability to control fall armyworm in just 3 yr after their release in Brazil. Here we summarize what is known about Bt resistance in fall armyworm in Brazil, a phenomenon perhaps never seen before in any part of the world. Furthermore, we suggest that the interactions between management practices adopted (or not adopted, e.g., refuge compliance) to delay the evolution of resistance and the ecological and evolutionary characteristics of fall armyworm are driving the rapid evolution of resistance to Bt corn in Brazil. As newer products emerge in the market, careful consideration will be needed to maximize trait durability.

THE SHAPE OF THE SPECIES BOUNDARY WITH EXPONENTIAL FAILURE, REINFORCEMENT, AND THE "MISSING SNOWBALL"	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Chromosomal incompatibility; comparative analysis; Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities; reproductive isolation; reinforcement	DOBZHANSKY-MULLER INCOMPATIBILITIES; MISMATCH REPAIR SYSTEM; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; POSTZYGOTIC ISOLATION; HALDANES RULE; SEXUAL ISOLATION; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; POPULATION-GENETICS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; NATURAL-SELECTION	Under simple assumptions, the evolution of epistatic "Dobzhansky-Muller" incompatibilities between a pair of species should yield an accelerating decline of log overall reproductive compatibility-a "snowball" effect that might rapidly provide new species with "reality." Possible alternatives include: (1) simple exponential failure, giving a linear rate of log compatibility loss, and (2) "slow-down," likely during reinforcement in which mate choice evolves to prevent deleterious hybridization, yielding a decelerating log compatibility loss. In analyses of multiple datasets, we find little support for the snowball effect, except possibly in Lepidoptera hybrid viability. The snowball predicts a slow initial rate of incompatibility acquisition, with low initial variance; instead, highly variable compatibility is almost universally observed at low genetic distances. Another deviation from predictions is that reproductive isolation usually remains incomplete until long after speciation. These results do not disprove snowball compatibility decay, but can result if large deleterious effects are due to relatively few genetic changes, or if different types of incompatibility evolve at very different rates. On the other hand, data on Bacillus and Saccharomyces, as well as theories of chromosomal evolution, suggest that some kinds of incompatibility accumulate approximately linearly, without Dobzhansky-Muller effects. In microorganisms, linearity can result from direct negative effects of DNA sequence divergence on compatibility. Finally, a decelerating slowdown model is supported for sympatric Leptasterias starfish, and in Drosophila prezygotic isolation in sympatry but not allopatry, providing novel comparative evidence for reinforcement.

E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) during 2 yr. During ear formation, instar densities of H. zea and S. frugiperda were recorded for each hybrid. We found that H. zea first, second, and fifth instar densities were each affected by Mon810 and Bt11 Bt corn but not by 176 corn. Surprisingly, first and second instars were found in higher numbers on ears of Mon810 and Bt11 corn than on non-Bt corn. Densities of third and fourth instars were equal on Bt and non-Bt hybrids, whereas densities of fifth instars were lower on Bt plants. S.frugiperda larval densities were only affected during 1 yr when second, and fourth to sixth instars were lower on ears of Mon810 and Bt11 hybrids compared with their non-Bt counterparts. Two likely explanations for early instar H. zea densities being higher on Bt corn than non-Bt corn are that 1) Bt toxins delay development, creating a greater abundance of early instars that eventually die, and 2) reduced survival of H. zea to later instars on Bt corn decreased the normal asymmetric cannibalism or H. zea-S. frugiperda intraguild predation of late instars on early instars. Either explanation could explain why differences between Bt and non-Bt plants were greater for H. zea than S. frugiperda, because H. zea is more strongly affected by Bt toxins and more cannibalistic.

Correct morphology-based identifications are challenging in many genera due to relatively little interspecific differences in wing patterns. Geographic infraspecific variation is sometimes more substantial than variation between species. In this paper we present a large DNA barcode dataset of South American Lycaenidae. We analyze how well DNA barcode BINs match morphologically delimited species. Methods: We compare morphology-based species identifications with the clustering of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) delimitated by the RESL algorithm in BOLD, which assigns Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). We examine intra- and interspecific divergences for genera represented by at least four morphospecies. We discuss the existence of local barcode gaps in a genus by genus analysis. We also note differences in the percentage of species with barcode gaps in groups of lowland and high mountain genera. Results: We identified 2,213 specimens and obtained 1,839 sequences of 512 species in 90 genera. Overall, the mean intraspecific divergence value of CO1 sequences was 1.20%, while the mean interspecific divergence between nearest congeneric neighbors was 4.89%, demonstrating the presence of a barcode gap. However, the gap seemed to disappear from the entire set when comparing the maximum intraspecific distance (8.40%) with the minimum interspecific distance (0.40%). Clear barcode gaps are present in many genera but absent in others. From the set of specimens that yielded COI fragment lengths of at least 650 bp, 75% of the a priori morphology-based identifications were unambiguously assigned to a single Barcode Index Number (BIN). However, after a taxonomic a posteriori review, the percentage of matched identifications rose to 85%. BIN splitting was observed for 17% of the species and BIN sharing for 9%. We found that genera that contain primarily lowland species show higher percentages of local barcode gaps and congruence between BINs and morphology than genera that contain exclusively high montane species. The divergence values to the nearest neighbors were significantly lower in high Andean species while the intra-specific divergence values were significantly lower in the lowland species. These results raise questions regarding the causes of observed low inter and high intraspecific genetic variation. We discuss incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization as most likely causes of this phenomenon, as the montane species concerned are relatively young and hybridization is probable. The release of our data set represents an essential baseline for a reference library for biological assessment studies of butterflies in mega diverse countries using modern high-throughput technologies an highlights the necessity of taxonomic revisions for various genera combining both molecular and morphological data.

Effect of coffee alkaloids and phenolics on egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Lepidoptera; Lyonetiidae; coffee resistance; caffeine; Coffea arabica; egg-laying preference	CHLOROGENIC ACID; PLANT PHENOLICS; HERBIVOROUS INSECTS; CAFFEINE; RESISTANCE; DEFENSE; ANTIOXIDANT; METABOLISM; PESTICIDES; MECHANISM	The recognized importance of coffee alkaloids and phenolics mediating insect-plant interactions led to the present investigation aiming to test the hypothesis that the phenolics chlorogenic and caffeic acids and the alkaloid caffeine and some of its derivatives present in coffee leaves affect egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera (= Perileucoptera) coffeella (Guerin-Wneville & Perrottet) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), one of the main coffee pests in the Neotropical region. These phytochemicals were, therefore, quantified in leaves from 12 coffee genotypes and their effect on the egg-laying preference by the coffee leaf miner was assessed. Canonical variate analysis and partial canonical correlation provided evidence that increased leaf levels of caffeine favour egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner. An egg-laying preference bioassay was, therefore, carried out to specifically test this hypothesis using increasing caffeine concentrations sprayed oil leaves of one of the coffee genotypes with the lowest level of this compound (i.e. Hybrid UFV 557-04 generated from a cross between Coffea racemosa Lour. and C. arabica L.). The results obtained allowed the recognition of a significant concentration-response relationship, providing Support for the hypothesis that caffeine stimulates egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner in coffee leaves.

Recently, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) has developed resistance to two toxin Bt maize and cotton (Cry1A and Cry2A). Hence, growers are transitioning to three toxin Bt cotton and maize that express both Cry toxins and the Vip3Aa toxin. H. zea susceptibility to Vip3Aa is threatened by 1) a lack of availability of non-Bt refuge crop hosts, including a 1-5% annual decline in the number of non-Bt maize hybrids being marketed; 2) the ineffectiveness of three toxin cultivars to function as pyramids in some regions, with resistance to two out of three toxins in the pyramid; and 3) the lack of a high dose Vip3Aa event in cotton and maize. We propose that data should be collected on current Cry-resistant H. zea in the field to inform future Bt resistance models and that the deployment of Bt toxins and non-Bt refuge crops should be adjusted to favor susceptibility of H. zea to Bt toxins such as Vip3Aa. Finally, maize growers should be incentivized to plant non-Bt structured refuge and have access to hybrids with high-yielding genetic potential at a reasonable price.

Maize breeding programs funded from public and private sources have developed and released germplasm with resistance to European corn borer whorl leaf feeding and, to a lesser extent, sheath and sheath collar feeding during flowering. A 4-yr study of 100 hybrids each year was undertaken to evaluate levels of resistance to European corn borer available to the farmer in commercial hybrids. About 90% of the maize hybrids evaluated have some resistance to whorl leaf feeding and about 75% have some resistance to sheath and sheath collar feeding. In approximately two-thirds of the hybrids evaluated in Missouri, the resistance levels could be further enhanced and susceptible hybrids improved with the introduction of additional genes for resistance.

(Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), is Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae), which causes significant damage to sericulture production. Therefore, diagnosing fungal disease and developing new control measures are crucial to silk production. To better understand the responsive and interactive mechanisms between the host silkworm and this fungus, variations in silkworm gene expression were investigated using the suppression subtractive hybridization method following the injection of B. bassiana conidia. Two cDNA libraries were constructed, and 140 cDNA clones were isolated. Of the 50 differentially expressed genes identified, 45 (112 clones) were identified in the forward library, and 5 (28 clones) were identified in the reverse library. Expression profiling of six of these genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) verified that they were induced by the fungal challenge. The present study provides insight into the interaction between lepidopteran insects and pathogenic fungi.

King & H.E. Robins. (Asteraceae) threatens several economic and environmental activities in the eastern subtropical regions of South Africa and is a target for biological control. Three populations of Pareuchaetes insulata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) originating from Florida (USA), Cuba and Jamaica were released at 30 separate sites in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Subsequent overlapping of two of these populations in the field and the likelihood of interbreeding posed a potential risk of establishment failure. To explore the genetic diversity of the different P. insulata populations and test for the existence of pre- and post-zygotic reproductive isolation between them, molecular analyses and cross-mating experiments were conducted. Mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed significant genetic similarity between them. Cross-mating trials between Floridian and Jamaican populations of P. insulata revealed no significant pre- and post-zygotic isolation, with no demonstrable differences in measured parameters between the 'parental' populations, the F-1 'hybrids' and the backcrosses. These results suggest that P. insulata populations released in South Africa are part of the same 'parental' population. Genetic incompatibility is, therefore, relatively unlikely to be the cause of any failure in establishment of P. insulata at any of the release sites.

Results from two-choice bioassays indicate various degrees of female preference to the hybrids, Four hybrids received more eggs than control plants, whereas the remainder received fewer eggs. Relatively similar results were obtained when filter paper sticks baited with pentane and steam distillation extracts v,,ere evaluated. Methanol extracts from all eight hybrids received fewer eggs than the methanol controls. Results showed that pentane and steam distillation extracts contain chemicals that elicit female oviposition response, while methanol extracts may contain chemicals that deter or repel females to oviposition.

Based on traditional classification, four species are recorded from Sri Lanka:Pelopidas agna,P. mathias,P. subochraceaandP. conjuncta. The aim is to test the taxonomic hypotheses of the Sri LankanPelopidasas they are currently recognised based on morphology. We achieve this by analysing the phylogenetic relationships among thePelopidasas well as between thePelopidasand tribe Baorini both inside and outside of Sri Lanka. We used DNA sequence data from the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) "barcode" region and two nuclear DNA regions, elongation factor 1-alpha(EF1-alpha) and wingless (Wgl) collected for Sri LankanPelopidasand combined with all availablePelopidassequence data from public databases. The reconstructed phylogeny showed thatP. mathias,P. agnaandP. conjunctawere not monophyletic. Additionally,P. agnain Sri Lanka may now be a hybrid population that retains theP. agnamorphology but possesses the mitochondrial DNA ofP. mathias(termed a 'ghost' population). Finally, two lineages ofP. conjunctawere identified in Sri Lanka, appearing more closely related to other species ofPelopidasthan to each other. This study demonstrates the phylogenetic complexity within thePelopidasand the uniqueness of the Sri LankanPelopidasthat have not been previously appreciated. This new knowledge is important in planning conservation management and may also guide future work on the potential mechanisms of evolutionary diversification of island butterflies.

The results obtained from the nutritional indices of the whole fourth and fifth instar larvae, on the basis of dry weight, showed that the highest efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) were observed when larvae were fed with hybrid KLM78*MO17. The lowest ECI value was observed in larvae fed with hybrid K36*MO17. The lowest ECD was observed when larvae were fed with hybrid K35*K36. The growth index of overall immature stages varied from 0.021 to 0.062, with the minimum on K48*K18 and the maximum on K47*K19. The standardized insect-growth index and fitness index were highest when larvae were fed with hybrid K47*K19. The lowest standardized insect-growth index was on K48*K18. Also, the lowest fitness index was on K48*K18. Developmental time of the fourth and fifth instars was longest when larvae were fed with hybrid K48*K18. The results of this study indicate that K35*K36 and K48*K18 are unsuitable hybrids for the feeding and growth of the pest.	[Hosseininejad, A.

J	Harvey, GT				Harvey, GT			Interspecific crosses and fertile hybrids among the coniferophagous Choristoneura (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							SPRUCE BUDWORM LEPIDOPTERA; SOUTH-CENTRAL OREGON; FUMIFERANA LEPIDOPTERA; RETINIANA LEPIDOPTERA; EGG WEIGHT; OCCIDENTALIS; POPULATIONS	Laboratory studies of seven North American Choristoneura species and two subspecies from widely distributed locations demonstrate the low level of genetic separation among them. No differences were found in numbers (n = 30) or morphology of chromosomes among members of the group or in any of the hybrids examined. High levels of mating success were obtained in all inter se matings as well as in crosses and back-crosses. However, mating success was greater for crosses within host type and within pheromone type than for crosses between types. Viability and fertility were similar in all the hybrids and close to those of the inter se progenies. Mean weights of initial eggs varied by a factor of 2 from the lowest (C. pinus Freeman) to the highest (C. lambertiana ponderosana Obraztsov). Mean weights of initial egg produced by hybrids were generally close to those of the parental species. However, when one parent was C. fumiferana (Clem.), mean weights of initial eggs were either much larger (male C. fumiferana) or much smaller (female C. fumiferana) than either parental type. These differences could affect survival of some progeny under harsh conditions. This evidence supports other studies in indicating that C. fumiferana is genetically distinct from other species in this group.

Flavone (maysin, chlorogenic acid, and apimaysin plus 3'methoxymaysin) content was determined for each hybrid from 2-d-old pollinated silks. Significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) differences among hybrids were found in the weight of larvae fed silk diets of the commercial hybrids. In 50 out of 74 comparisons, larvae that fed on silk diets with formalin weighed significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) more than those that fed on silk diets without formalin. Varying concentrations of formalin used in the diet up to 10X did not appear to react with maysin: maysin and maysin content were identical after the formalin was added to maysin, indicating no reaction had occurred. Consistent, significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) negative correlations were found between weight of larvae feeding on silk diets with and without formalin and maysin and chlorogenic acid among the four maturity groups tested but not for apimaysin plus 3'methoxymaysin. Several hybrids (Hyperformer HS9843, Stanford S88B, N C + X6485, Zimmerman Z63W, Pioneer 3140, Ag America 6714, and ICI Garst H8285) possessed silks that exhibited high antibiosis against larvae of the corn earworm. Silks of some hybrids did not contain sufficient amounts of maysin or other flavones to account for the observed reduction in growth of larvae, e.g., N C + X6485 and Zimmerman Z63W in the short-season hybrids and SSI UTN 318 in the preliminary-season hybrids. Silks of Zimmerman Z63W produced small larvae and had less maysin and apimaysin + 3'methoxymaysin than silks of the susceptible standard Stowell's Evergreen.

Diallel Analysis of Corn Earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Resistance in Maize	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Helicoverpa zea; Lepidoptera; Noctuidae; corn earworm; diallel cross; host plant resistance; maize; Zea mays		Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie, is a major pest of maize in the United States. Host plant resistance is widely considered a desirable method for reducing losses to this pest. Nine inbred lines were evaluated for resistance to ear damage, larval survival, and weight of larvae. Mp313E and Mp717 sustained less damage than the other lines, and larval survival and growth on these lines was reduced. Analysis of a diallel cross among the nine lines indicated that both general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) were significant sources of variation in the inheritance of resistance to ear damage. GCA was also a significant source of variation in the inheritance of resistance to larval growth. GCA effects for reduced larval weight were significant for Mp313E and Mp717. These lines could be useful in the development of maize hybrids with corn earworm resistance.	[Matthews, Gerald A.; Williams, W.

We sampled these allozymes in a 28-population transect north of Genoa in Italy, through the hybrid zone where these taxa meet. We used the numerical techniques developed for hybrid zone analysis to study the patterns of genetic differentiation and their underlying evolutionary causes. The hybrid zone is characterized by a very short and steep central region, flanked by broad tails of introgression extended up to 100 km in either direction. From mean two-locus disequilibrium of D = 0.148 (maximum-likelihood two-unit support limits 0.139-0.153), and after accounting for minor differences in the center locations of the single-locus dines, which act to bias the dispersal estimate, we estimated a dispersal rate of sigma = 4.4 (3.7-5.5) km/gen(1/2). The effective selection needed to maintain the steep central portion is strong, 0.47 less than or equal to s* less than or equal to 0.64, when combined over potential intrinsic (genetic background) and extrinsic (ecological) sources of selection. The dines in allozyme loci showed variation that was significantly different between the most divergent shapes, and the differences are attributable to different degrees of introgression on the edusa side of the zone. The average selection acting on individual allozyme loci was high at s(e) approximate to 1.5%, but because of the narrowness of the central region of the dine, we suspect that this estimate is somewhat biased by selection on loci closely linked to the allozyme markers. A common question for taxa that show fixed allozyme differences in parapatry is whether or not they are genetically isolated. A fairly general measure of genetic isolation across hybrid zones is the time, T, that it takes a neutral allele to cross the hybrid zone and recombine into the opposite genetic background, given by T = (beta/sigma)(2), where beta is the barrier strength of the hybrid zone. Genetic isolation in the Pontia zone is weak, with T approximate to 25 generations for most allozyme markers. By this measure, populations of daplidice and edusa on opposite sides of the hybrid zone share more identical-by-descent alleles than do populations of phenotypically pure daplidice in, say, France and Morocco. Accordingly, we think it best for systematists to consider edusa as a well-marked subspecies of P. daplidice.

Transgenic maize resistant to kernel attack by S. cerealella has been developed, but could pose a nutritional risk to humans and livestock. Therefore, alternative sources of resistance posing no threat to consumption should be identified. In this study, our main objectives were to assess genetic variability for kernel damage by S. cerealella under natural infestation and to determine genetic and environmental factors contributing to genotype, year, and genotype*year variability. Factorial regression was performed to obtain a biological explanation for the number of kernels damaged per ear. Seventy-seven Spanish maize landraces along with six hybrid checks were evaluated in 2004, 2005, and 2006. There was variability for kernel damage by natural infestation of S. cerealella among the landraces: popcorn landraces were among the least damaged, whereas hybrid checks were among the most susceptible genotypes. Plant characteristics associated with ear appearance could be the main stimulatory factors for oviposition and feeding of S. cerealella moths, followed by husk coverage of the ear. It was confirmed that temperature is the main environmental factor affecting S. cerealella development. Genotypes sensitive to infestation by S. cerealella were more negatively affected by higher temperatures than the least attractive genotypes, and lower temperatures reduced the number of kernels damaged on the most susceptible genotypes more than on the least susceptible.

New mitochondrial DNA sequence data for D. petilia, in conjunction with allozyme, structural, morphometric and pattern characters, constitute a compelling case for its specific rank. The holotype of D. petilia has never been located and, as the type location is uncertain, a neotype is designated. Fresh material was collected and examined for this project. Danaus petilia and D. chrysippus have been separated at Lydekker's Line for an estimated 1.1 million years, and they remain interfertile. However, as an allopatric taxon, diagnosable from D. chrysippus, D. petilia merits specific status under the phylogenetic species concept. The following pairs of D. chrysippus subspecies are considered to be synonyms, the first member of each pair having priority: chrysippus + aegyptius (subspecies), klugii + infumata (hybrid phenotypes) and orientis +liboria (subspecies).

The fourth- and fifth-instar larvae fed on hybrid K47*K19 had the highest weight of food consumption and those reared on hybrid KSC705 had the lowest value of food consumption. The highest weight gain of the larvae was observed when H. armigera were fed hybrid KLM78*MO17 and lowest when they were fed hybrids K36 * MO17, KSC705, and K35 * K36. Pupal weight of H. armigera was heaviest when larvae were fed hybrid K47*K19 and lightest when they were fed hybrid KSC705. The highest proteolytic activity of the fourth-instar larvae was observed when they were fed hybrid KSC705, and the lowest activity was observed when they were fed hybrid K47*A67. Fifth-instar larvae that fed on hybrid K47*K19 showed the highest proteolytic activity. Fourth-instar larvae that fed on hybrid K36*MO17 showed the highest amylase activity. The fifth-instar larvae fed on hybrid K47*A67 showed the maximum amylase activity and those reared on the K48*K18 showed the minimum activity. Our results indicated that K36 * MO17, KSC705, and K48 * K18 were the most unsuitable hybrids for feeding H. armigera.	[Hosseininejad, A.

Experiments were conducted in the municipalities of Campinas and Mococa, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in the growing seasons of 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, in a randomized complete block design, with 12 treatments and four replications. The variables evaluated were: grain productivity, one hundred grain weight and grain yield. For the assessment of damage caused by S. frugiperda was verified the intensity of leaf injuries through visual scale of notes, with variation of 0 and 9, from 15 to 60 days after sowing. Lower scores of damage caused by S. frugiperda were found in transgenic hybrids. Most conventional hybrids do not differ in grain productivity from at least one of isogenic transgenic versions. The same maize hybrid with different Bt toxins may have different productive behavior in field conditions. Different Bt toxins respond differently to damage caused by S. frugiperda.

Performance and preference of sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, on rice cultivars	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						Oryza sativa; Crambidae; Poaceae; Lepidoptera; relative growth rate; oviposition; boring success	LEPIDOPTERA CRAMBIDAE; CROSS-RESISTANCE; STEM-BORERS; SELECTION; QUALITY; TRAITS	Abstract The sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a major agronomic pest in the southeastern USA. This study was conducted to investigate the performance of D. saccharalis on eight rice cultivars widely grown in Louisiana and to assess the relationship between oviposition preference and offspring performance. In a previous study, oviposition preference of sugarcane borers was found to vary on the same eight rice cultivars. In this study, variation in larval performance on the eight cultivars was observed. The overall performance of larvae in terms of relative growth rate and boring success of larvae was highest on Priscilla and Cocodrie. Larval performance was lower on the hybrid XL723, the Clearfield (herbicide-resistant) variety CL161, and the medium grain Bengal. Also, larvae took more time to enter into the stem of the hybrid XL723 compared with Cocodrie. Significant positive correlations were observed among relative growth rate and boring success and between larval performance and oviposition preference. Significant positive correlations among measures of larval performance and oviposition preference suggest the operation of a common resistance mechanism. Results in laboratory and greenhouse extended into the field, where Cocodrie and Cheniere were the most damaged cultivars, whereas CL161 and the medium grain Jupiter were least injured in terms of average number of stem borer entry/exit holes per plant. Results from this study could contribute to the use of resistant cultivars in an integrated management program for stem borers and the resistant cultivars identified in this study could be used as sources of resistance in breeding programs for resistance against stem borers.

Fall armyworm in corn is managed with insecticides and corn hybrids expressing insecticidal proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt). The early detection of insect resistance is important for making appropriate management decisions and for implementing integrated pest management and insect resistance management recommendations. The objective of this study was to estimate susceptibility of fall armyworm populations to the Cry1F Bt insecticidal protein, emphasizing collections from locations where fall armyworm overwinters in the U.S. Fall armyworm neonates were exposed to artificial diet treated with increasing Cry1F concentrations, and mortality and growth inhibition were evaluated after 7 d. Differences in Cry1F susceptibility between the most susceptible and the most tolerant field populations were 2-and 6-fold for 2012 and 2013, respectively. These results are consistent with other susceptibility studies of Bt toxicity in other species although reduced susceptibility in one population collected from Florida may suggest resistance development.

Clustering of loci controlling species differences in male chemical bouquets of sympatric Heliconius butterflies	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Heliconius; Lepidoptera; pheromones; quantitative trait locus mapping; speciation	SEX-PHEROMONE BIOSYNTHESIS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; GENETIC-BASIS; EVOLUTION; DESATURASE; MOTH; TRAITS; TRANSCRIPTOME; SUBSTITUTION	The degree to which loci promoting reproductive isolation cluster in the genome-that is, the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation-can influence the tempo and mode of speciation. Tight linkage between these loci can facilitate speciation in the face of gene flow. Pheromones play a role in reproductive isolation in many Lepidoptera species, and the role of endogenously produced compounds as secondary metabolites decreases the likelihood of pleiotropy associated with many barrier loci. Heliconius butterflies use male sex pheromones to both court females (aphrodisiac wing pheromones) and ward off male courtship (male-transferred antiaphrodisiac genital pheromones), and it is likely that these compounds play a role in reproductive isolation between Heliconius species. Using a set of backcross hybrids between H. melpomene and H. cydno, we investigated the genetic architecture of putative male pheromone compound production. We found a set of 40 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) representing 33 potential pheromone compounds. QTL clustered significantly on two chromosomes, chromosome 8 for genital compounds and chromosome 20 for wing compounds, and chromosome 20 was enriched for potential pheromone biosynthesis genes. There was minimal overlap between pheromone QTL and known QTL for mate choice and color pattern. Nonetheless, we did detect linkage between a QTL for wing androconial area and optix, a color pattern locus known to play a role in reproductive isolation in these species. This tight clustering of putative pheromone loci might contribute to coincident reproductive isolating barriers, facilitating speciation despite ongoing gene flow.	[Byers, Kelsey J. R.

Information on the susceptibility of Eucalyptus species and hybrids to insect pests is scarce. As such, this study aimed to assess the development of S. violascens on Eucalyptus species and hybrids under laboratory conditions. Neonate caterpillars were reared on leaves of Eucalyptus grandis, E. urophylla, E. camaldulensis and E. globulus; and hybrids of E. urophylla x E.urophylla, E. urophylla x E. grandis, E. grandis x E. camaldulensis and E. urophylla x E. camaldulensis. Biological parameters such as instar and larval phase duration, pupal weight, adult longevity and fecundity, and eclosion rate were evaluated. Eucalyptus globulus is not an S. violascens host, leading to 100% larval mortality in the first instar. Eucalyptus grandis extended the larval phase of the insect and decreased larval survivorship and female pupal weight, resulting in high levels of deformity in adults and low egg eclosion, in addition to exhibiting significant antibiosis to S. violascens. Eucalyptus camaldulensis and VM-1 extended the larval period and reduced pupal weight. Eucalyptus urophylla was better suited to the development and reproduction of S. violascens than other Eucalyptus species and hybrids. E. grandis is a promising source of resistance to S. violascens. The use of resistant species and hybrids contributes to pest management, reducing the need for chemical control.

This Insect pest caused reduction of plant growth and yields in both protected and open-field. Bio-rational insecticides provide efficient, economic, and promising strategy for controlling different insect pests. The use of bio-rational insecticides as alternatives for chemicals pesticides have many advantages as decreasing the environmental risks of chemical pesticides, the specificity of most of these entomopathogens, and being harmless to vertebrates and other non-target organisms. The aim of this work was to evaluate different bio-rationale insecticides including microbial pesticides, bio-chemicals derived from micro-organisms and other natural sources for controlling T. absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) which is a major insect pest of the tomato crop in Egypt. Two hybrid tomato varieties; Shifa and Savera; were planted in two different plantation periods in the horticulture nursery. The effect of five different bio-rationale insecticides namely; spinosad, Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk), azadirachtin, Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschn.) and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) was evaluated in trials under the greenhouse conditions. The bio-insecticides were applied at LC50 for semi-field application. Populations of T. absoluta were assessed by larval counts and the tomato yields were assessed for the two varieties at full plant maturity. Use of spinosad caused 78-97% reduction in T. absoluta population which was the most effective bio-rational insecticide among those used in this study. Btk was the second most effective bio-rational insecticide against T. absoluta with 78-91% reduction, followed by the botanical extract azadirachtin which showed 70-83% reduction on the target insect. Use of entomopathogenic fungi, M. anisoplia and B. bassiana caused 46 -75% reduction in comparison to the untreated plants. In conclusion, utilization of spinosad, Btk and azadirachtin were the most effective bio-rationale insecticides which provide promising and safe alternative insecticides for controlling T. absoluta.

J	Naisbit, RE; Jiggins, CD; Linares, M; Salazar, C; Mallet, J				Naisbit, RE; Jiggins, CD; Linares, M; Salazar, C; Mallet, J			Hybrid sterility, Haldane's rule and speciation in Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene	GENETICS			English	Article							REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SEXUAL SELECTION; GENE FLOW; EVOLUTION; BUTTERFLIES; ZONES; CHROMOSOMES; DOMINANCE; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR	Most genetic studies of Haldane's rule, in which hybrid sterility or inviability affects the heterogametic sex preferentially, have focused on Drosophila. It therefore remains unclear to what extent the conclusions of that work apply more generally, particularly in female-heterogametic taxa such as birds and Lepidoptera. Here we present a genetic analysis of Haldane's rule in Heliconius butterflies. Female F, hybrids between Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno are completely sterile, while males have normal to mildly reduced fertility. In backcrosses of male F-1 hybrids, female offspring range from completely sterile to fully fertile. Linkage analysis using the Z-linked triose-phosphate isomerase locus demonstrates a "large X" (Z) effect on sterility. Expression of female sterility varies among crosses in this and a previous study of Heliconius. Sterility may result from the production of normal but infertile eggs, production of small infertile eggs, or from a complete failure to develop ovarioles, which suggests multiple routes to the evolution of hybrid sterility in these Heliconius species. These results conform to the expectations of the "dominance" rather than "faster male" theories of Haldane's rule and suggest that relatively few loci are responsible. The two species are broadly sympatric and hybridize in the wild, so that female hybrid sterility forms one of several strong but incomplete barriers to gene flow in nature. The effect of female sterility is comparable to that of selection against non-mimetic hybrids, while mate choice forms a much stronger barrier to gene transfer.

Association of Insect-Derived Ear Injury With Yield and Aflatoxin of Maize Hybrids Varying in Bt Transgenes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						corn earworm; fall armyworm; vegetative insecticidal protein; Bacillus thuringiensis; Aspergillus flavus	SOUTHWESTERN CORN-BORER; ASPERGILLUS-FLAVUS; PLANTING DATE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; ACCUMULATION; CONTAMINATION; PROTEINS; LEPIDOPTERA; FUMONISIN; STRESS	Environmental factors have been associated with the production of aflatoxin in maize, Zea mays L., and it is inconclusive whether transgenic, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), maize has an impact on aflatoxin accumulation. Maize hybrids differing in transgenes were planted in two locations from 2014 to 2017.Yield, aflatoxin, and ear injury caused by corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were measured across three groups of hybrids differing in transgenes including near-isogenic hybrids, and water-stressed conditions. The hybrid groups consisted of non-Bt hybrids with no Bt transgenes, a second group with one or more Cry-Bt transgenes, and the third group with vegetative insecticidal Bt protein and Cry-Bt transgenes (CryNip-Bt). Across the six data sets derived from 11 experiments, the Cry-Bt and CryNip-Bt hybrids had less ear injury and aflatoxin on average than non-Bt hybrids. The effects of ear injury on yield and aflatoxin were more prominent and consistent in Corpus Christi, TX, where hybrids experienced more water-limited conditions than in College Station, TX. The trend of increased aflatoxin among hybrids with increased ear injury was further resolved when looking at Cry-Bt and CryNip-Bt isogenic hybrids in Corpus Christi. The results supported that the maize hybrids with the inclusion of Cry-Bt and CryNip-Bt transgenes warrant further investigation in an integrated approach to insect and aflatoxin management in sub-tropical rain-fed maize production regions. Research outcomes may be improved by focusing on areas prone to water-stress and by using hybrids with similar genetic backgrounds.

J	Ohshima, I				Ohshima, Issei			Host-associated pre-mating reproductive isolation between host races of Acrocercops transecta: mating site preferences and effect of host presence on mating	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Ecological speciation; Gracillariidae; host race; hybridisation; Juglans; Lepidoptera; Lyonia; mating propensity; pleiotropy	LEAF-MINING MOTH; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; LEPIDOPTERA; BEHAVIOR; SPECIALIZATION; YPONOMEUTA; SHIFTS	1. A correlation between habitat and mating site preference is crucial for reproductive isolation between populations with different ecological requirements in the absence of any other barriers to gene flow. In phytophagous insects, host-plant preference of ovipositing females has been postulated to directly influence the extent of assortative mating. 2. Although this pleiotropic effect of host preference is commonly postulated in both theoretical and empirical studies in phytophagous insects, few studies have assessed the mating site preferences of both sexes. In herbivorous insects, it is crucial whether males have the same host preference as ovipositing females. 3. This study examines whether males and females have preferences for mating sites and assesses the effects of host presence on mating activity in a leaf-mining moth, Acrocercops transecta Meyrick (Gracillariidae). This species consists of two host races, which are associated with Juglans ailanthifolia Carr. (Juglandaceae) and Lyonia ovalifolia (Wall.) Drude (Ericaceae). The two host races clearly differ in host preferences of ovipositing females. 4. In an experiment of mating site selection, Lyonia-associated host race females significantly preferred Lyonia, while males of the Lyonia-associated host race and both sexes of the Juglans-associated host race did not show a preference for either plant. The mating activity of the Lyonia-associated host race was not reduced in the absence of host plants. In the Juglans-associated host race, however, the proportion of successful matings was significantly reduced when the host was absent. 5. These laboratory experiments provide empirical evidence that the different host associations in A. transecta do not directly lead to host-induced assortative mating between the two host races as a pleiotropic effect. However, the present results suggest that the combined effects of the mating-site preference of Lyonia-associated females and the mating propensity of Juglans-associated females could contribute to reproductive isolation between the two host races.

Yield, Insect-Derived Ear Injury, and Aflatoxin Among Developmental and Commercial Maize Hybrids Adapted to the North American Subtropics	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Helicoverpa zea; Spodoptera frugiperda; Aspergillus flavus; maize breeding	SOUTHWESTERN CORN-BORER; NON-BT-CORN; PLANTING DATE; ASPERGILLUS-FLAVUS; ACCUMULATION; CONTAMINATION; LEPIDOPTERA; DAMAGE; TEMPERATURE; MANAGEMENT	The development of maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids that are adapted to subtropical areas of North America should consider yield potential under heat and moisture stress, and reduced susceptibility to insect herbivory and disease. To aid in this process, maize hybrids (43 developmental and seven non-Bt commercial hybrids) were evaluated for severity of ear injury to Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), susceptibility to Aspergillus flavus (Link) (Deuteromycetes: Moniliales), and yield. In subtropical Corpus Christi and College Station, TX, field experiments conducted over three years revealed significant differences among maize hybrids with the rank of the selected measurements differing across the two locations. When the location by maize hybrid interaction was not significant, variation across the main factors of maize hybrid genetics (in all cases) and location (in some cases) was detected. In 2014, a significant location by maize hybrid interaction in yield but not aflatoxin and ear injury were likely associated with differences in weather between locations. In Corpus Christi in 2015, a location by maize hybrid interaction was detected for ear injury only. Overall, experimental maize hybrids, containing the inbred line Tx777, displayed partial resistance to insect derived ear injury in both locations, and some hybrid testcrosses exhibited low rates of aflatoxin accumulation while maintaining relatively high yields.

A re-evaluation of the Aricoris constantius group with the recognition of three species (Lepidoptera: Riodinidae)	ZOOLOGIA			English	Article						Brazil; biology; distribution; Paraguay; Planalto Central		Material currently classified under the name Aricoris constantius (Fabricius, 1793) is examined and found to consist of three distinct species inhabiting southeastern and central Brazil, from the Brazilian state of Bahia to Paraguay. They are A. constantius, A. tutana (Godart, [1824]), reinstated status and A. monotona (Stichel, 1910), reinstated status, the latter two removed from synonymy. Besides significant morphological differences in wing pattern and genitalia, their status as separate species is supported by their overlapping ranges where each phenotype is sympatric with at least one other, with no evidence of hybridization. Notes are provided on the habitat in open formations, range and distribution in south eastern Brasil, and biology, including evidence of mymecophily.

In Sao Paulo State there are mulberry some hybrids whose productivity are higher than the commonly cultivated varieties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of mulberry hybrids (Morus spp.) on the cocoon production of silkworm (Bombyx mori L.). The experiment was conducted at the Unidade Regional de Pesquisa de Galia do Instituto de Zootecnia, SP. The caterpillars were fed on leaves of the hybrids IZ-3/2, IZ-13/6, IZ-15/7, IZ-19/13, IZ-56/4, IZ-57/2, IZ-40, IZ-64, in a rearing hut at 25 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C and 75% +/- 5% relative humidity. 'Korin' was used as standard. The hybrids affected the duration of the larval period and the weight of the caterpillars, prepupaes and the silk glands as well. There was a reduction in the duration of larval development when the caterpillars had been fed with hybrid IZ-56/4 and the 'Korin' variety. Hybrids IZ-57/2, IZ-56/4 and IZ-15/7 presented the highest cocoon production.

Three experimental hybrids resistant to ear feeding in 1991 and 5 in 1992 were treated with encapsulated B. thuringiensis, permethrin, or left unsprayed. The commercial hybrid 'Jubilee' was included as a susceptible control. In 1991, all resistant hybrids (with and without B. thuringiensis) controlled O. nubilalis larvae as well as or better than Jubilee + permethrin, a predominant management combination in the midwestern United States. In 1992, two untreated resistant hybrids, and 4 treated with B. thuringiensis controlled total larvae as well as Jubilee + permethrin. In addition, 2 of the hybrids treated with B. thuringiensis consistently provided >95% control of late instars (3rd-5th) in the corn ear. Based on fresh market standards Ino larvae or damage in ear, husk, or silk), ear protection from 4 of 5 resistant hybrids treated with B. thuringiensis did not differ from Jubilee + permethrin. Based on processing marketability (no larvae or damage on ear kernels), all 5 resistant hybrids treated with B. thuringiensis were not different from the conventional management strategy. Population densities of generalist predators did not differ between the untreated plots and those treated with B. thuringiensis; however, predator density was lower in the plots treated with permethrin. Results from this study suggest that the integration of resistant hybrids and B. thuringiensis can provide a viable alternative to insecticide-based O. nubilalis management programs for sweet corn in the upper midwestern United States.

Documentation of resistance to Bt toxins has caused growing concern in agricultural communities regarding the ability to keep fall armyworm populations below economic thresholds. The existence of two host strains referred to as the 'rice' and 'corn' strains is a complicating and under-researched factor of fall armyworm biology and management. It is essential to characterize the differences between the host strains, as well as their rice/corn hybrid offspring, to elucidate their contributions to field-evolved resistance. RESULTS Corn was a preferred oviposition host for both rice and corn strain fall armyworm, and a suitable larval host plant for each of the four populations tested. Corn strain females displayed a significant preference towards oviposition on plants that lacked mechanical damage. The rice strain population was generally less tolerant to Cry1F corn tissue than the corn strain and hybrid populations, which performed in a similar way to one another. CONCLUSION The preference for corn as an ovipositional host may have an impact on resistance management when coupled with differential host strain Bt tolerances, though more studies are needed. Hybrid tolerance to Bt toxins could possibly contribute to the evolution of Bt resistance. This is the first study to compare the larval fitness and survival of rice/corn hybrid fall armyworm to that of pure host strains using a tissue-based approach.

Cry1Ab events 176, Bt11, MON810, and MON802; Cry1Ac event DBT418; and Cry9C event CBH351 were evaluated. Plants of each corn hybrid were manually infested with two third-, fourth-, or fifth-instar O. nubilalis. Larvae were held in proximity to the internode of the plant above the ear with a mesh sleeve. Lan ae were put on tie plants during corn developmental stages V8, V16, R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6. This study shows that not all B. thuringiensis hybrids provide the same protection against O. nubilalis injury. Hybrids with B. thuringiensis events Bt11, MON810, MON802, and CHB351 effectively protected the corn against tunneling by late-instar O, nubilalis. Event 176 was effective in controlling late-instar O. nubilalis during V12 and V16 corn developmental stages; however, significant tunneling occurred by fourth instars during R3 and R5. Event DBT418 was not effective in controlling late-instar O. nubilalis during corn vegetative or reproductive stages of development. Whether the B, thuringiensis hybrids satisfied high- and ultrahigh-dose requirements is discussed.

A geographic isolate of BmNPV was identified in the state of Parana, Brazil. It was infecting B. mori larvae and various organs and target tissues were identified, however, there was no information about the infection of Malpighian tubules (MT). The MT comprises the excretory system of B. mori and acts in the elimination of toxic substances and in hydroelectrolytic homeostasis. Thus, the present study examined the susceptibility and cytopathology of B. mori MT to BmNPV. To this end, hybrid fifth instar larvae were inoculated with a virus suspension at different days post-inoculation (dpi). MT segments were collected and divided into the ampullae, proximal, medial and distal regions. These were processed for light microscopy and transmission electron analysis. The MT regions revealed differences in susceptibility to BmNPV and the ampullae in its transition area was infected from the sixth dpi; the other regions did not reveal any evidence of infection. The transition area of the ampullae has not been previously described in Lepidoptera and its cytopathology revealed a hypertrophic nucleus with viroplasm, followed by the formation and development of viral polyhedra, which are common characteristics of infections by Alphabaculovirus. Thus, infection of the ampullae of the MT of B. mori by BmNPV, together with other known targets, compromises the metabolic balance of the insect, which results in consequences for silk production and damage to the sericulture sector.

The corn hybrids were exposed to natural seasonal fluctuations of a univoltine ecotype European corn borer population. Larval injury parameters, grain yields, and gross incomes were quantified during the 3-yr study. In general, the Bt-corn hybrids had significantly higher yields than the untreated non-Bt isolines in 1997 and 1998 when corn borer pressures were high. However, most of the Bt-corn hybrids did not produce significant yield advantages in 1999 when the European corn borer pressure was low. Some of the Bt-corn hybrids even produced significantly lower yields than their untreated non-Bt counterparts in 1999. The performances of non-Bt isolines that were treated with permethrin granules at whorl stage were similar to Bt-corn hybrids in 1998 when the corn borer pressure was high and similar to the untreated non-Bt isolines in 1999 when the corn borer pressure was low. Injury-free corn produced by Bt-corn hybrids did not necessarily translate into higher yields in some hybrid groups. Grain moisture at harvest, which can result in moisture penalty or dockage, was significantly higher in most Bt-corn hybrids. Gross incomes of the Bt-corn hybrids were generally higher than the untreated non-Bt isolines when the corn borer infestation was high, but were either similar to or lower than the untreated non-Bt isolines when the corn borer infestation was low.

LEP.; HOST RACES; DIFFERENTIATION	A plausible case of allochronic differentiation, where barrier to gene flow is primarily attributable to a phenological shift, was recently discovered in Portugal for the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. Previous results suggested that the observed 'summer population' (SP) originated from the sympatric winter population (WP). Our objectives were to finely analyse these patterns and test their stability in time, through field monitoring and genetic analyses of larvae and adults across different years. Reproductive activity never overlapped between SP and WP. Microsatellites showed a clear differentiation of the SP, consistent with a strong reduction in gene flow owing to the phenological shift. Assignment tests suggested that some individuals shift from the SP to the WP phenology, causing some hybridization. We discuss these patterns and their maintenance over time. This could be a first stage of allochronic speciation, and SP should be considered as a distinct phenological race.

Associations between host plant concentrations of selected biochemical nutrients and Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini, infestation	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						free amino acids; Poaceae; sorghum; Lepidoptera; histidine; fructose; sugarcane; Crambidae; sudangrass; sugars; preference; stalkborer; johnsongrass; maize	EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; LEPIDOPTERA CRAMBIDAE; STEM-BORERS; OVIPOSITION; SUGARCANE; RESPONSES; SORGHUM; TEXAS	The Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is an economic pest of sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) and other graminaceous host crops, and it attacks grassy weeds. Oviposition preference has been known to be for plants with leaves that form folds. This study is the first to associate the nutritional quality of crop and forage plant hosts with Mexican rice borer injury. Three experiments were conducted to determine the levels of selected biochemical nutrients, including free amino acids and sugars, in four grass weeds [barnyardgrass, Echinochloa crus-galli (L.); broadleaf signalgrass, Urochloa platyphylla (Munro ex C. Wright); johnsongrass, Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.; and Vasey's grass, Paspalum urvillei Steud.], a forage grass [sudangrass, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moensch spp. drummondi (Nees ex Steud.) de Wet & Harlan], three crop species [maize, Zea mays L.; sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench; and sugarcane, Saccharum spp.], and a sorghum-sudangrass forage hybrid (all Poaceae). Of 16 free amino acids detected among plants in the first two experiments, only high accumulations of free histidine in sudangrass and maize were associated with increased infestations by Mexican rice borer larvae.

Before the introduction of transgenic insect-resistant hybrids, this pest was largely ignored in field corn, but now many Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn hybrids have activity against corn earworm. However, the value of control in the northeastern United States is unclear because the risk posed by corn earworm to field corn has not been well characterized. To understand the threat from corn earworm and the value of Bt hybrids in field corn, we assessed corn earworm injury in Bt and non-Bt hybrids at 16 sites across four maturity zones throughout Pennsylvania in 2010, and 10 sites in 2011. We also used corn earworm captures from the PestWatch pheromone trapping network to relate moth activity to larval damage in field corn. Corn earworm damage was less than one kernel per ear at 21 of 26 sites over both years, and the percentage of ears damaged was generally <15%, much lower than in the southern United States where damage can be up to 30 kernels per ear. At sites with the highest damage levels, Bt hybrids suppressed corn earworm damage relative to non-Bt hybrids, but we found no differences among Bt traits. Cumulative moth captures through July effectively predicted damage at the end of the season. Currently, the additional benefit of corn earworm control provided by Bt hybrids is typically less than US$4.00/ha in northeastern field corn.

J	Krogerus, H				Krogerus, H			Chloroclystis v-ata relicta ssp n (Lepidoptera, Geometridae), a new taxon from SW Finland, doomed to go extinct?	ENTOMOLOGICA FENNICA			English	Article								An isolated population of Chloclystis v-ata (Haworth, 1809), occurring at Karkali Peninsula, a nature reserve in southwestern Finland, is described as a new subspecies, ssp. relicta ssp.n., on the basis of differences in appearence and phenology compared to the nominate subspecies. The Central European population of Ch. v-ata has been expanding to the north, reaching the Baltic Sea area in recent decades and Finland in 1985. Thus, the new subspecies which is actually protected by law is now threatened by hybridization with the nominate subspecies. In contrast to the bivoltine nominate subspecies, the Karkali population is univoltine. The biology of the new subspecies is discussed.										12	1	2	0	0	ENTOMOLOGICA FENNICA	HELSINKI	C/O ZOOLOGICAL MUSEUM P RAUTATIEKATU 13 UNIV HELSINKI, FIN-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND	0785-8760			ENTOMOL FENNICA	Entomol.

Plant resistance and its effect on the Peritrophic membrane of southwestern corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) larvae	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						host plant resistance; peritrophic membrane; southwestern corn borer	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; LEAF-FEEDING RESISTANCE; GERMPLASM LINE; SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA; MAIZE; REGISTRATION; PYRALIDAE; NOCTUIDAE; MATRIX; MECHANISMS	The southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a serious pest of corn, Zea mays L., in the southern United States. Corn germplasm lines with conventional genetic leaf-feeding resistance to this pest, the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), and other lepidopterans have been released to the public by USDA-ARS scientists located in Mississippi. Recent studies suggest the insect resistant lines disrupt the integrity of the peritrophic membrane of the fall armyworm. The objectives of this study were to investigate any morphological differences in the structure of the peritrophic membrane of southwestern corn borer larvae feeding on resistant and susceptible corn hybrids and to quantify the damage. Larvae were reared under field and laboratory conditions on three corn hybrids (two resistant and one susceptible). Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the peritrophic membrane for abnormalities such as holes or tears and to count the holes or tears in the membrane. Differences in the degree of damage to peritrophic membrane of larvae fed on resistant and susceptible plants were not detected. Up to five distinct layers of the membrane were observed in each larva. Variation in the amounts of damage to the peritrophic membrane observed from larvae feeding on all plant material was high. Plant resistance adversely affects growth and development of southwestern corn borer larvae, and further investigations are needed to explain the role of plant resistance and its relation to peritrophic membrane in southwestern corn borer larvae.

Such germplasm should be very useful for farmers in developing countries because of its ability to resist/tolerate the most injurious lepidopterous pests of maize. Ten maize varieties and hybrids have been evaluated in the investigations reported herein, namely, Across 90390 IRW, Across 90390 IRY, PR86590, Across 86590 IR, Experimental Hybrid 1, CML67 x CML135, CML139 x CML135, CML139 x Ki3, Ki3 x CML131, Ki3 x CML69. These varieties and hybrids were planted in CIMMYT's stations in Poza Rica (lowland tropical) and Tlaltizapan (subtropical). The plants were artificially infested with Fall Armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), Sugarcane Borer (SCB) (Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius) and Southwestern Corn Borer (SWCB) (Diatraea grandiosella Dyar) in separate trials. Grain yield of the test varieties and hybrids across environments in the insecticide - protected plots, varied from 6 - 7 t/ha (EH1, CML139 x Ki3) to 4 - 5 t/ha (Across 86590). The single cross hybrid CML67 x CML135 consistently had the highest and Ki3 x CML131 had the lowest leaf feeding resistance against FAW, SCB and SWCB. The average % grain yield reduction suffered because of infest; infestation by FAW, SCB and SWCB was the highest (27.4 %) in Ki3 x CML131 followed by PR86590, Across 86590, EH1, CML67 x CML135, Ki3 x CML69, CML139 x Ki3, Across 90390 IR, CML139 x CML135 and Across 90390 IRW (7.9%). The regression of yield reduction on foliar damage ratings across all the cultivars infested with FAW, SCB and SWCB revealed significant correlation between the two parameters suggesting the possible partitioning of resistance into antibiosis and tolerance. Our data show the absence of antibiosis tolerance in the hybrids Ki3 x CML131 while CML139 x CML135, CML67 x CML135 and CML139 x Ki3 and the varieties Across 90390 IRW and Across 90390 IRY possessed both components of resistance against FAW SCB and SWCB. Our data show that CIMMYT has developed potentially useful hybrids which because of antibiosis and tolerance types of resistance against FAW, SCB and SWCB, suffered little damage and % grain yield reduction under heavy infestation. Such germplasm can be very useful for the poor farmers who cannot afford costly insecticides.

One class of unisexual hybrid disruption is described by Haldane's rule, namely that the sex which is absent, inviable or sterile is the heterogametic sex. This effect is mainly due to incompatibility between X and Y chromosomes. We propose that this incompatibility is due to a mutual imbalance between meiotic drive genes, which are more likely to evolve on sex chromosomes than autosomes. The incidences of taxa with sex chromosome drive closely matches those where Haldane's rule applies: Aves, Mammalia, Lepidoptera and Diptera. We predict that Haldane's rule is not universal but is correct for taxa with sex chromosome meiotic drive. A second class of hybrid disruption affects the male of the species regardless of which sex is heterogametic. Typically the genes responsible for this form of disruption are cytoplasmic. These instances are accounted for by the release from suppression of cytoplasmic sex ratio distorters when in a novel nuclear cytotype. Due to the exclusively maternal transmission of cytoplasm, cytoplasmic sex ratio distorters cause only female-biased sex ratios. This asymmetry explains why hybrid disruption is limited to the male.			HURST, LD (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD, DEPT ZOOL, OXFORD OX1 3PS, ENGLAND.

Genetically modified plants with genes from soil inhabiting spore forming bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner produces delta-endotoxin, which target the gut of insect, so food intake and its utilization are likely to be affected. Four Bt cotton hybrids, each with one of four events, viz. MRC 6301 Bt (cry1Ac gene), JKCH 1947 Bt (modified cry1Ac gene), NCEH 6R Bt (cry1Ab/cry1Ac fused gene) and MRC 7017 BG II (cry1Ac and cry2Ab genes) were compared for nutritional indices of spotted bollworm, Earias vittella (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Nolidae) along their isogenic non-Bt genotypes. Various consumption and utilization indices, viz. consumption index (CI), relative growth rate (RGR), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) were worked out. The data show that all the Bt hybrids significantly reduced CI, RGR, ECI and ECD of 4th instar E. vittella larvae as compared to their isogenic non-Bt genotypes when fed on squares and bolls of 90, 120 and 150 days crop age. Further, the Bollgard II genotype MRC 7017 BG II was found to be more lethal and recorded significantly lower values for all the above given indices. Despite the fact that, the differences between Bt and their isogenic non-Bt genotypes decreased with increasing age of the crop but still Bt cotton hybrids were significantly inferior as insect food as compared to the non-Bt ones even at the later stages of the crop growth. The amount of Cry1Ac toxin in squares and bolls of Bt cotton had a significant negative correlation with food consumption and utilization indices of E. vittella larvae. The studies thus indicated that Bt toxin has a substantial impact on the nutritional performance of E. vittella.	[Shera, P.

Although there are numerous studies on ejaculates in lepidopteran insects, ejaculate comparisons among sibling species have not been adequately addressed to understand possible reproductive barriers to hybridization. Here, we examined the interspecific and intraspecific variations of ejaculates in the sibling noctuid moths Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa assulta. We found that there were considerable variations in the number of apyrene and eupyrene sperm and the length of eupyrene sperm. Male pupal mass explained not only a significant proportion of the variation in apyrene sperm number in both H. armigera and H. assulta, but also a significant proportion of the variation in eupyrene sperm number in H. assulta. There was a significant positive relationship between the number of eupyrene sperm and the number of apyrene sperm in both species. No difference in the length of eupyrene sperm was found between them; however, ejaculates of H. armigera had many more eupyrene sperm than H. assulta had. In H. armigera, large males generally mated with large females. The evolutionary consequences of these differences are discussed in this paper.

Knowing the genetic structure of those may provide information to improve the conservation of commercial lines by estimating inbreeding over generations and the consequences of excessive use of those lineages. Here, we analyzed the genetic diversity of seven breeds and eight hybrid lines from Eastern Europe and Asia using highly polymorphic microsatellites markers to determine its genetical impact on their use in global breeding programs. No consistent pattern of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found for most breed and hybrids; and the absence of a linkage disequilibrium also suggests that the strains are in equilibrium. A principal coordinate analysis revealed a clear separation of two silkworm breeds from the rest: one (IBV) originated from India and the other one (RG(90)) from Romania/Japan. The tendency of the other breeds from different geographic origins to cluster together in a general mix might be due to similar selection pressures (climate and anthropogenic factors) in different geographic locations. Phylogenetic analyses grouped the different silkworm breeds but not the hybrids according to their geographic origin and confirmed the pattern found in the principal coordinate analysis.

Morphological, hybridization, and DNA examinations indicated the distinctness of S. riobravis n. sp. from S. carpocapsae, S. feltiae, S. glaseri, and S. intermedia. Diagnostic characters include the length of the infective-stage juveniles, the color and shape of the spicules and gubernaculum, and lack of a tail projection in the male. The ratio E (distance from anterior end to excretory pore divided by tail length) of the infective juveniles separates this new species from previously described steinernematids. S. riobravis n. sp. did not hybridize with other Steinernema species. DNA analysis showed that the 304 base pair region of the 26 S. ribosomal subunit examined in S. riobravis n. sp. is significantly divergent from the same region in S. carpocapsae, S. feltiae, S. glaseri and S. serratum. It appears to be naturally selected for the subtropical semi-arid environment where it serves as a biological control agent for corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae), at high temperatures.

In contrast, genetic erosion within species has rarely been tracked, and is often studied by inferring past population dynamics from contemporaneous estimators. An alternative to such inferences is the direct examination of past genes, by analysing museum collection specimens. While providing direct access to genetic variation over time, historical DNA is usually not optimally preserved, and it is necessary to apply genotyping methods based on hybridization-capture to unravel past genetic variation. In this study, we apply such a method (i.e., HyRAD), to large time series of two butterfly species in Finland, and present a new bioinformatic pipeline, namely PopHyRAD, that standardizes and optimizes the analysis of HyRAD data at the within-species level. In the localities for which the data retrieved have sufficient power to accurately examine genetic dynamics through time, we show that genetic erosion has increased across the last 100 years, as revealed by signatures of allele extinctions and heterozygosity decreases, despite local variations. In one of the two butterflies (Erebia embla), isolation by distance also increased through time, revealing the effect of greater habitat fragmentation over time.

Chemosensory-mediated sexual communication with pheromones is an essential component of mate recognition in moths. Confronted with sex pheromone stimuli released from conspecific and closely related heterospecific females, which partially overlap in chemical composition, male moths are under strong selection to recognize compatible mates. Here, we investigated the role of pheromone signals in premating communication in the sibling species Spodoptera littoralis and S. litura (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae). Further, we measured the reproductive consequence of conspecific vs. heterospecific matings. Both species use Z9,E11-14:Ac as the major pheromone compound, and the 11-component blend found in pheromone glands of S. littoralis comprises the compounds found in S. litura. Accordingly, S. littoralis and S. litura males readily responded to conspecific and heterospecific calling females in no-choice behavioral tests. In contrast, in a dual-choice test, S. littoralis males choose conspecific calling females, whereas S. litura males did not discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific females. In S. littoralis females, heterospecific matings had a negative fitness effect as compared to conspecific matings. Female longevity, egg-laying and hatching of larvae were significantly reduced by matings with heterospecific males. Reciprocal crossings, between S. litura females and S. littoralis males, were prevented by genital morphology, which is consistent with reduced heterospecific attraction of S. littoralis males in a dual-choice assay. On the other hand, matings between S. littoralis females and S. litura males, under a no-choice situation, show that interspecific matings occur in zones of geographical overlap and corroborate the idea that mate quality, in these closely related species, is a continuous and not a categorical trait.

(Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), a destructive pine forest pest. The bacterium is a Gram-stain-positive, red-pigmented coccus, oxidase-negative, nitrate-reducing, non-motile and non-spore-forming. Strain Tp2(T) was subjected to a taxonomic study using polyphasic approach that included morphological and biochemical characterizations, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, DNA DNA hybridization, DNA G + C content analysis, comparative fatty acid profiles, and analyses of quinones and polar lipids. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain Tp2(T) revealed that Arthrobacter agilis DSM 20550(T) was the closest known strain (98% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). DNA DNA hybridization of A. agilis DSM 20550(T) and strain Tp2(T) resulted in a DNA DNA relatedness value of 11.9% (20.2% reciprocal). The DNA base composition of strain Tp2(T) was 69.5 mol%, which is consistent with the other recognized members of Actinobacteria that have a high G+C content in their genome. The polar lipid pattern of strain Tp2(T) consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol (major), phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol and unknown glycolipids. The cellular fatty acids were anteiso C-15:0 and anteiso 0170 and the major menaquinone was MK-9(II-H-2). The peptidoglycan type was A3 alpha with an L-Lys L-Thr L-Ala(3) interpeptide bridge. The above-mentioned characterization qualifies strain Tp2(T) as genotypically and phenotypically distinct from closely related species of the genus Arthrobacter with validly published names. Strain Tp2(T) is therefore proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Arthrobacter, described as Arthrobacter pityocampae sp. nov. The type strain is Tp2(T) (=DSM 21719(T)=NCCB 100254(T)).

Assessing resistance of sugarcane varieties to sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis Fab.

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in the leaves and stalks of six sugarcane cultivars in a series of greenhouse and laboratory assays. Investigation of plant factors and infestation rates to better discriminate stalk damage by the sugarcane borer indicated that infestation of 7-month-old, single plants with 20 larvae at the third or fourth instar per plant was suitable to assess tunneling length. Three cultivars (i.e. SP803280, RB928064, and RB835486) had lower stalk damage (i.e. tunnel length) than cultivar SP891115, which exhibited relatively greater susceptibility to tunneling by the borer. The time required for the larvae to enter the sugarcane stalk was longer for cultivar SP803280, indicating resistance traits on the stalk surface, which correlated with lower stalk damage. Larvae feeding on SP813250 stalks had the lowest weight gain, indicating that this cultivar has resistance traits to larval development within its stalks. Cultivars RB867515 and SP891115 resulted in the highest mortality of early-stage larvae feeding on leaves, indicating the presence of resistance factors in their leaves. Multi-trait cluster and principal component analyses placed the cultivars into three and four clusters, respectively. The cultivars placed in different groups that exhibited resistance to leaf feeding, stalk entrance, and tunneling by the sugarcane borer could be used for crossings in sugarcane breeding programs with the goal of obtaining higher levels of resistance to D. saccharalis.

However, identification of insect parasitoids is often difficult, and they are suspected to contain many cryptic species. Here, we ask whether the cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcode could function as a tool for species identification and discovery for the 20 morphospecies of Belvosia parasitoid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae) that have been reared from caterpillars (Lepidoptera) in Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG), northwestern Costa Rica. Barcoding not only discriminates among all 17 highly host-specific morphospecies of ACG Belvosia, but it also raises the species count to 32 by revealing that each of the three generalist species are actually arrays of highly host-specific cryptic species. We also identified likely hybridization among Belvosia by using a variable internal transcribed spacer region 1 nuclear rDNA sequence as a genetic covariate in addition to the strategy of overlaying barcode clusters with ecological information. If general, these results will increase estimates of global species richness and imply that tropical conservation and host-parasite interactions may be more complex than expected.

Such preferences for symmetry may have an innate basis. Small degrees of bilateral or radial asymmetry of flowers are considered to represent a measure of developmental instability, since deviations from perfect symmetry reflect the inability to maintain developmental precision during ontogeny. Environmental factors causing increased asymmetry in leaves and flowers include radioactive radiation, ultraviolet radiation, excess artificial fertilizer, various pollutants, extreme saline conditions, herbivory and competition. Genetic factors that contribute to increased asymmetry in plants include homozygosity, hybridization, mutation and quantitative genetic differences among individuals. Insect preferences for symmetric flowers increase reproductive success of both pollen donors and recipients by affecting seed set and embryo abortion. The ability of insects to discriminate between flowers of superior and inferior quality is hypothesized to depend on the level of developmental instability of the perceptive apparatus of insects. Hence, asymmetry of insects may have consequences for plant reproductive success and mating patterns.

To study the molecular biology of RhPV, identification of a cell line that supports replication of the virus is essential. We screened nine cell lines derived from species within the Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera for susceptibility to RhPV following RNA transfection. We observed cytopathic effects (CPE) only in cell lines derived from hemipterans, specifically GWSS-Z10 cells derived from the glassy winged sharp shooter, Homalodisca, coagulata and DMII-AM cells derived from the corn leaf hopper, Dalbulus maidis. Translation and appropriate processing of viral gene products, RNA replication and packaging of virus particles in the cytoplasm of GWSS-Z10 cells were examined by Western blot analysis, Northern blot hybridization and electron microscopy. Infectivity of the GWSS-Z10 cell derived-virus particles to the bird cherry-oat aphid, R. padi, was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot. The GWSS-Z10 cell line provides a valuable tool to investigate replication, structure and assembly of RhPV. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results showed that larvae displayed a similar performance when fed kernels, but not leaves of 5422Bt1, 5422CBCL and their near-isogenic non-Bt corn (5422). Significantly higher Cry1Ab amounts were detected in larvae fed leaves than kernels of both Bt hybrids, with different molecular weights of protein band in plants (72 and 90 kDa for 5422Bt1 and 5422CBCL, respectively), gut contents (65 kDa), feces (50 kDa), which indicated that larvae had lower ingestion, higher degradation and excretion of Cry1Ab when fed kernels not leaves of both Bt hybrids. Significantly higher levels of cadherin-like receptors and alkaline phosphatase transcripts were detected in larvae fed leaves than kernels of two Bt hybrids. Catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activities in larvae fed 5422Bt1 leaves were significantly higher than that of 5422 treatments. Therefore, S. litura had low susceptibility to 5422Bt1 and 5422CBCL when larvae fed kernels not leaves of Bt corn. Additionally, S. litura presented a much stronger tolerance to 5422CBCL than 5422Bt1.

Thermal Requirements, Fertility, and Number of Generations of Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Heat sensitivity; heat stress; small tomato borer	TEMPERATURE	The small tomato borer Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is one of the major pests of solanaceous in Central and South America. Little is known about the role of temperature on the biological traits of this species. Development time of the immature stages and longevity and reproduction of adults of N. elegantalis at constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27, and 30 +/- 1 degrees C) were determined when larvae were fed on fruits of the tomato hybrid "Paronset." Neoleucinodes elegantalis completed its life cycle at temperatures between 15 degrees C and 27 degrees C, indicating that it can remain active throughout the year in the subtropical region of Brazil. The temperature threshold (T-t) was 8.8 degrees C for the egg stage and 7.7 degrees C for the larval and pupal stages. The small tomato borer required 588.2 degrees-day for its full development. At 30 degrees C, the eggs were infertile, indicating that temperatures above 27 degrees C are deleterious to the fertilization/embryonic development of the studied population of N. elegantalis.

Comparison with samples from the same area going back to before 1900, indicate that the frequency of form alcippus has increased from 16 per cent to 71 per cent (1909-91) while f. dorippus has decreased from 14 per cent to 2 per cent, f. aegyptius from 66 per cent to 24 per cent and f. albinus from 4 per cent to 3 per cent. Genotype frequency differences between the sexes at two of the three loci examined suggest that a balanced polymorphism is maintained by opposing selective forces acting on males and females. Non-gametic (genotypic) disequilibrium between two pairs of unlinked loci indicates that natural selection is involved, again with sex differences. It is suggested that the polymorphism originated after hybridization of allopatric races which evolved during the Pleistocene but are now maintained sympatrically. The selective agents have not been identified but mimetic relationships, both Batesian and Mullerian, are almost certainly involved.

The results revealed that the body weight (mg) and frass weight (mg) of larvae positively correlated with nitrogen levels. There was a significant difference in weight gained by larval instars at various nitrogen applications with highest weight (0.085mg/l) at N4 (150KgN/ha) and minimum (0.078mg/l) at NO (0KgN/ha). Identical results were observed for the frass weight of different larval instars while maximum frass weight i.e., 0.018 mg was recorded for fifth instar fed on KWS-55 with the application of N4, while minimum frass weight of fifth instar i.e., 0.012 mg fed on KK-8711 applied with NO and NI. Significant difference for weight gained by the larvae on all three hybrids was recorded but 5th instar maximum larval weight 0.078 mg was recorded by feeding on KWS-55 while minimum 0.066 mg on KK-8711. Cumulative field data analysis showed significant difference among the average maize borer/plant at different nitrogen doses (N0-N4). Maximum number of C. partellus (2 larvae/ plant) was found on KWS-55 at (N4) while minimum (0 larvae / plant) was found on KK-8711. The results suggest that the population development of maize borer is dependent on the application of nitrogen doses.

Disease resistance, along with high productivity, are important selection criteria for developing commercial hybrids of B. mori. We used bioassays and molecular markers linked to susceptibility/resistance to baculovirus infection to analyze the response of commercial B. mori hybrids from two companies to a geographic isolate of B. mori multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmMNPV) from Parana State in Brazil. Both of these commercial lines were highly susceptible to BmMNPV, with death rates of 92 and 94%. A polymorphic fragment of approximately similar to 350 bp, associated with susceptibility, and an similar to 800-bp fragment, associated with resistance to BmMNPV, were detected in all specimens. An additional fragment of similar to 480 bp, recently identified by our research team as a BmMNPV genomic sequence, was detected in the infected silkworms and could be used as a molecular marker for the diagnosis of nucleopolyhedrovirus infection.

Effect of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis cotton on pink bollworm (Lepidoptera : Gelechiidae) response to sex pheromone	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bacillus thuringiensis crops; cadherin; Pectinophora gossypiella; resistance detection; molecular monitoring	MONITORING INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE; FEMALE ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE; AN-STEPHENSI MOSQUITOS; HCH DIELDRIN RESISTANT; PEACH-POTATO APHIDS; BT TOXIN CRY1AC; FITNESS COSTS; TRANSGENIC COTTON; FIELD; CROPS	Fitness costs associated with resistance to transgenic crops producing toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) could reduce male response to pheromone traps. Such costs would cause underestimation of resistance frequency if monitoring was based on analysis of males caught in pheromone traps. To develop a DNA-based resistance monitoring program for pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), we compared the response to pheromone traps of males with and without cadherin alleles associated with resistance to Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). When irradiated males from two hybrid laboratory strains with an intermediate frequency of resistance alleles were released in large field cages, the probability of capture in pheromone traps was not lower for males with resistance alleles than for males without resistance alleles. These results suggest that analysis of trapped males would not underestimate the frequency of resistance. As the time males spent in traps in the field increased from 3 to 15 d, the success of DNA amplification declined from 100 to 30%. Thus, the efficiency of a DNA-based resistance monitoring program would be improved by analyzing males remaining in traps for 3 d or less.

The hop vine borer is more specialized in its diet and occurs in corn generally south of the plant community ecotone, whereas the potato stem borer is polyphagous and occurs in corn mostly north of the Great Lakes plant transition zone. We analyzed the genetic composition of each species using cellulose acetate electrophoresis and resolved 19 loci of which 6 exhibited fixed or nearly fixed allelic differences. We expect that this will be useful in determining the degree of hybridization where the two species become sympatric due to expected continued range expansions in Michigan, Wisconsin, and New York State.

In a 2-yr sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), study involving four commercially produced sugarcane cultivars and four insecticide treatment thresholds, 'LCP 85-384' and 'HoCP 91-555' were the most susceptible based on percentage of bored internodes compared with the more resistant 'HoCP 85-845' and 'CP 70-321'. In 2001, the 10% infested stalks threshold was not as effective as the 5% early season-10% late season and 5% full season for HoCP 91-555. Based on D. saccharahs injury under natural infestation conditions, susceptible cultivars seem to require a lower infestation threshold than the more resistant cultivars to achieve adequate injury reduction. Among yield components, only the theoretical recoverable sugar per stalk was significantly increased by applying insecticides. With the resistant HoCP 85-845, differences were not detected for percentage of bored internodes among treated versus untreated management regimes. The resistant HoCP 85-845 had higher levels of fiber in our study; however, no clear pattern on resistance mechanisms was established, because the resistant cultivar CP 70-321 had comparatively low levels of fiber. The development of cultivar-specific thresholds is expected to lower the amount of insecticide used for D. saccharalis management in the sugarcane industry, reduce selection pressure, and delay the development of insecticide resistance.

The efficacy of the neonicotinoid seed treatment clothianidin at two commercially available rates and their interaction with a transgenic corn hybrid (Bt corn), trait expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis variety aizawai insecticidal toxin Cry 1Fa2, against black cutworm larvae was investigated. Clothianidin at a rate of 25 mg kernel(-1) on Bt corn increased larval mortality and reduced larval weight gains additively. In contrast, weights of larvae fed non-Bt corn seedlings treated with clothianidin at a rate of 25 mg kernel(-1) increased significantly, suggesting either compensatory overconsumption, hormesis, or hormoligosis. Both Bt corn alone and clothianidin at a rate of 125 mg kernel(-1) applied to non-Bt corn seedlings caused increased mortality and reduced larval weight gains. In two field trials, plots planted with Bt corn hybrids consistently had the highest plant populations and yields, regardless of whether they were treated with clothianidin at the lower commercial rate of 25 mg kernel(-1) The use of Bt corn alone or in combination with the low rate of clothianidin (25 mg kernel(-1)) seems suitable as a means of suppressing black cutworm in no-tillage cornfields, although rescue treatments may still be necessary under severe infestations. Clothianidin alone at the low rate of 25 mg kernel(-1) is not recommended for black cutworm control until further studies of its effects on larval physiology and field performance have been completed.

Reproductive and life table parameters for E. lignosellus were examined at nine constant temperatures from 13 to 36 degrees C with sugarcane as the larval food source. The pre- and post-oviposition periods decreased with increasing temperatures and reached their minimums at 33 and 36 degrees C, respectively. The oviposition period was longest at 27 degrees C. The mean fecundity, intrinsic rate of increase (r), and finite rate of increase (lambda) were greatest at 30 degrees C and decreased with increasing or decreasing temperature. The net reproductive rate (R-0) was greatest at 27 degrees C. The Briere-1 model best described the relationship between temperature and r. The generation (T) and population doubling times (DT) were shortest at 33 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The temperatures around 27 to 30 degrees C are most favorable for E. lignosellus population growth and significant damage can be expected under these climatic conditions. This data in combination with population monitoring of E. lignosellus under field conditions can be effectively used in population predictions of this pest in field and severe damage can be prevented by timely implementation of control measures.

In the present study, the orientation of some Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Poinar, 1976) (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) strains to perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L. (Poales: Poaceae) roots and greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (L., 1758) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larvae were investigated. For this purpose, three different strains of H. bacteriophora were used. One of them was a hybrid strain (HBH) and the two were parents (HB1138 and HB4) of the hybrid strain. Three experimental combinations were conducted in the study conducted in 2019 under laboratory conditions in Bursa, Turkey: (A) plant roots, larvae and control; (B) plant roots, control I and control II; and (C) mechanically damaged plant roots, control-I and control-11 in Y-tube olfactometers filled with moist sand. The results indicated that for combination A, most orientation to plants and larvae was seen in HB1138; for combination B, most orientation to plant roots was was seen in HBH; and for combination C, strain HB4 showed the most orientation to mechanically damaged plant roots. According to the results, each strain of the same EPN species may have a different response to plant roots and host insects.

Both species are major pests of agricultural commodities that are known to develop insecticide resistance, and they now coexist in areas whereH. armigerainvaded the Americas. This is the first study to compare the susceptibility of the two species to conventional insecticides. The susceptibility of third instarH. armigeraandH. zealarvae to indoxacarb, methomyl, spinetoram, and spinosad was determined using a diet-overlay bioassay in a quarantine laboratory in Puerto Rico. Mortality was assessed at 48 h after exposure for up to eight concentrations per insecticide. Spinetoram exhibited the highest acute toxicity againstH. armigera, with a median lethal concentration (LC50) of 0.11 mu g a.i./cm(2), followed by indoxacarb and spinosad (0.17 mu g a.i./cm(2)for both) and methomyl (0.32 mu g a.i./cm(2)). Spinetoram was also the most toxic toH. zea(LC(50)of 0.08 mu g a.i./cm(2)), followed by spinosad (0.17 mu g a.i./cm(2)) and methomyl (0.18 mu g a.i./cm(2)). Indoxacarb was the least toxic toH.zea, with an LC(50)of 0.21 mu g a.i./cm(2). These findings could serve as a comparative reference for monitoring the susceptibility ofH. armigeraandH. zeato indoxacarb, methomyl, spinetoram, and spinosad in Puerto Rico, and may facilitate the detection of field-selected resistance for these two species and their potential hybrids in areas recently invaded byH. armigera.

Resistance in Cultivated Sunflower to the Sunflower Moth (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Cultivated sunflower; Helianthus annuus; pest management; host plant resistance; sunflower moth; Homoeosoma electellum	HOMOEOSOMA-ELECTELLUM LEPIDOPTERA; GREAT-PLAINS; NATIVE MOTH; INSECTICIDES; HELIANTHUS; STRATEGIES; PARASITISM; GERMPLASM; MECHANISM; BEHAVIOR	A five-year field study evaluated 42 sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) accessions, 25 breeding lines, and 40 interspecific crosses for resistance to infestation and damage from larval feeding by naturally occurring populations of the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Accessions PI 175728 and PI 307946 had less than 3% feeding damage per head in all three years they were tested. Some interspecific crosses showed evidence of resistance; PAR 1673-1 had less than 2% seed damage in 2002 and 2003 and less than 3% in 2005. PRA PRA 1142 sustained less than 3% seed damage and STR 1622-1 had less than 2% seed damage in three years of trials. Breeding lines with potential resistance included 01-4068-2, which had the least amount of seed damage per head in 2002 (<1%) and in 2003 averaged only 2% damage. Line 01-4080-1, with less than 1% damage in 2002 and in 2003, was the least damaged entry in these evaluations. Hybrid '894' was included as a standard check; however, it consistently had among the lowest average seed damage from H. electellum feeding. Our investigation showed the potential for developing resistant genotypes for the sunflower moth to reduce seed feeding injury and to prevent yield losses for sunflower producers. The development of germplasm with host plant resistance would provide another tool in an integrated pest management approach for H. electellum. Additional effort is in progress to use the identified lines to introgress resistance genes into cultivated sunflower through conventional breeding facilitated by marker-assisted selection.

Specimens of U. austriacalis and U. rhododendronalis separate into several biogeographical groups. These allopatric groups are not recovered in the analyses of the two nuclear markers wingless and Elongation factor 1-alpha, except for U. austriacalis from the Pyrenees and the French Massif Central. The latter populations are also morphologically distinct and conspecific with Scopula donzelalis Guenee, 1854, which is removed from synonymy and reinstated as Udea donzelalis (Guenee, 1854) stat. rev. Furthermore, Udea altaica (Zerny, 1914), stat. n. from the Mongolian central Altai mountains, U. juldusalis (Zerny, 1914), stat. n. from the Tian Shan mountains of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and NW China, and U. plumbalis (Zerny, 1914), stat. n. from the Sayan Mountains of Northern Mongolia are raised to species level, and lectotypes are designated. Evidence of introgression of U. alpinalis into U. uliginosalis at three localities in the Central Alps is presented. A screening for Wolbachia using the markers wsp, gatB and ftsZ was negative for the U. alpinalis species group, but Wolbachia was found in single specimens of U. fulvalis and U. olivalis (both in the U. numeralis species group). We do not find evidence for the conjecture of several authors of additional subspecies in U. rhododendronalis, and synonymise U. rhododendronalis luquetalis Leraut, 1996, syn. n. and U. r. ventosalis Leraut, 1996, syn. n. with the nominal U. rhododendronalis (Duponchel, 1834).

Hybrid effects in field populations of the African monarch butterfly, Danaus chrysippus (L.)

However, typically these effects are shown by taking parents of known genotype into the laboratory and measuring components of the F, progeny under laboratory conditions. This leaves in doubt the real significance of such effects in the field. Here we use the well-known colour pattern genotypes of the African monarch or queen (Danaus chrysippus), which also control wing length, to test these effects both in the laboratory and in a contact zone in the field. By measuring the wing lengths in animals of known colour pattern genotype we show clear evidence for all three hybrid effects at the A and BC colour patterning loci, and importantly, that these same effects persist in the same presumptive F(1)s when measured in hybrid populations in the field. This demonstrates the power of a system in which genotypes can be directly inferred in the field and highlights that all three hybrid effects can be seen in the East African contact zone of this fascinating butterfly.

Selection can act on gene sequences but also on regulatory regions responsible for gene expression. Mimetic butterflies are a relevant system for speciation studies because wing colour pattern (WCP) often diverges between closely related taxa and is thought to drive speciation through assortative mating and increased predation on hybrids. Here, we generate the first transcriptomic resources for a mimetic butterfly of the tribe Ithomiini, Melinaea marsaeus, to examine patterns of differential expression between two subspecies and between tissues that express traits that likely drive reproductive isolation; WCP and chemosensory genes. We sequenced whole transcriptomes of three life stages to cover a large catalogue of transcripts, and we investigated differential expression between subspecies in pupal wing discs and antennae. Eighteen known WCP genes were expressed in wing discs and 115 chemosensory genes were expressed in antennae, with a remarkable diversity of chemosensory protein genes. Many transcripts were differentially expressed between subspecies, including two WCP genes and one odorant receptor. Our results suggest that in M. marsaeus the same genes as in other mimetic butterflies are involved in traits causing reproductive isolation, and point at possible candidates for the differences in those traits between subspecies. Differential expression analyses of other developmental stages and body organs and functional studies are needed to confirm and expand these results. Our work provides key resources for comparative genomics in mimetic butterflies, and more generally in Lepidoptera.

E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a target species of transgenic corn (Zea mays L) expressing pyramided Bacillus thuringiensis proteins. In 2011, a total of 150 F-2 two-parent families of S. frugiperda were established using single-pair matings of feral individuals collected from three locations in Louisiana and Florida. The objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility of these field derived families of S. frugiperda to a pyramided Bt corn hybrid containing Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111 traits. For each F-2 family, 96 neonates were assayed on leaf tissue of Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111 corn in the laboratory. None of the 150 families survived for 7 days on leaf tissue of the Bt corn plants. The results demonstrate that the field populations of S. frugiperda collected from Louisiana and Florida were susceptible to the pyramided Bt corn product containing Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111 traits. The data generated in this study can be used as baseline data for resistance monitoring. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Yang, Fei; Huang, Fangneng; Leonard, B.

E. Smith). Parameters measured were leaf-feeding damage at 7 and 14 days after infestation, ear penetration by larvae of the com earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), ear and plant height, days to 50% silk, and yield at maturity. Significant differences were found among hybrids for all measured parameters except days to 50% silk. Eighty larvae per plant infested at the 8- or 12-leaf stage resulted in significantly higher leaf-feeding damage ratings than 40 larvae per plant. Yield reductions were greater at the 8-leaf stage of infestation (32.4%) than at the 12-leaf stage of infestation (15.4%). Ear and plant height reductions were similar between the 8- and 12-leaf stages of infestation. Generally, 80 larvae did not cause a more significant reduction on ear and plant height than 40 larvae per plant. Plants in the 12-leaf stage tolerated damag e better than plants at the 8-leaf stage of plant development. Alough the hybrids tested in this study differed only in susceptibility, differences among hybrids were significant for leaf-feeding damage, ear penetration by corn earworm, ear and plant height, and yield.

Experiments were conducted from 1987 to 1989 to determine if corn with leaf feeding resistance retains its resistance to this pest in the reproductive stage and if resistance in the reproductive stage of growth could be detected among a group of hybrids. Staggered plantings of the hybrids were made to allow plants of both growth stages to be infested with neonate larvae on the same day. Larval survival and weights at 7 and 14 days after infestation were used to evaluate for resistance. Significant differences in larval growth and/or survival were found among hybrids within plant growth stages and between plant growth stages within hybrids. Larvae recovered from whorl stage plants of hybrids with leaf feeding resistance weighed two to three times more than those from reproductive stage plants of the same hybrids. Conversely, larvae from whorl-stage plants of some hybrids susceptible to leaf feeding weighed approximately twice as much as larvae from reproductive-stage plants of the same hybrids. These data indicate that the degree of resistance or susceptibility can shift with plant growth stage.

There were important differences in the resistance offered by the different Bt event corn hybrids. Hybrid comparison tests indicate that these Dipel-resistant first-instar European corn borer were not able to survive to adulthood on whorl-stage MON810, Bt11, or 176 Bt event corn plants. Third instars did not survive to adulthood on whorl-stage MON810 or Bt11. event corn plants but a small number of fifth instars were found on whorl-stage DBT418 plants infested with Dipel-resistant larvae. First and third instars of these Dipel-resistant European corn borers caused more leaf-feeding damage and more tunneling on whorl-stage Bt-corn plants than did the Dipel-susceptible European corn borers. However, in the single Bt corn hybrid test, there was no survival of the Dipel-resistant European corn borers on DK580BtX or MAX454 Bt plants 35 to 42 d after they had been infested with first instars. These results demonstrate that the current Kansas selection of Dipel-resistant European corn borer strain cannot establish reproducing populations in the tested Bt corn lines and hybrids.

Effects of Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) Damage on Sugarcane Yield	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						CP 78-1628; CP 88-1762; CP 89-2143; compensation; lesser cornstalk borer	RICE PLANTS; RESISTANCE; COMPENSATION; GROWTH	Feeding by lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), larvae on sugarcane (a complex hybrid of Saccharum spp.) causes leaf damage, dead hearts, and dead plants that can result in stand and yield loss. A 2-yr greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine sugarcane variety and plant age-specific feeding responses to E. lignosellus. Plants growing from single-eye setts of three varieties were exposed to a single generation of E. lignosellus larvae beginning at the three-, five-, and seven-leaf stages. Results indicated that the physical damage and resulting yield loss of plants attacked by E. lignosellus larvae were dependent on the variety and leaf stage at which they were infested. Significantly more plant damage was observed in all three varieties when infested at the three-than at the seven-leaf stage. Larvae caused significantly more plant damage and reduced yield in CP 89-2143 than in CP 78-1628. Tiller production increased in CP78D1628 and CP 88-1762 when infested at the three-leaf stage, whereas tiller production, biomass and sugar yield decreased in CP 89-2143 when infested at all leaf stages, compared with the untreated control. There was no reduction in yield when CP 78-1628 was infested at the three-or five-leaf stages. Biomass was reduced in CP 88-1762 when plants were infested at any of the leaf stages, but sugar yield was reduced only when infested at the seven-leaf stage. These results indicate that compensation in response to E. lignosellus damage was variety dependent and declined with the delay in infestation time.

The maize cultivars tested were: Inbred A, Mp 704, V-37, Population 10, Hybrid 511, Katumani Composite B, ER-29 SVR, Poza Rica 7832, ICZ2-CM, and MMV 400. Most cultivars were found susceptible to 3rd-instar larvae based on the incidence of dead heart symptoms, foliar feeding and stem tunnelling caused by stem borers in both the field and screenhouse experiments. However, the maize cultivars V-37, MMV 400 and Poza Rica 7832 sustained significantly lesser damage than the other cultivars when infested with neonates or 3rd instar larvae. The screenhouse experiments conducted with five maize cultivars, i.e. Inbred A, Mp 704, V-37, ER-29 SVR, and Poza Rica 7832 showed that neonates fed less on the resistant than the susceptible maize cultivars but feeding by the 3rd instars was equally high on all the maize cultivars except Mp 704 on which the larvae fed less than the others. In the cultivars infested with neonates, the mean period for 50% moth emergence P50 was longest on Mp 704 followed by Poza Rica 7832, ER-29 SVR, V-37 and Inbred A. In the cultivars infested with 3rd-instars, P.50 was longest for Poza Rica 7832 followed equally by the remaining cultivars. On the basis of the evidence presented we here conclude that neonates of C partellus are sensitive to the growth inhibiting effects of the resistant maize cultivars Mp 704, V-37, and Poza Rica 7832 but the older larvae are insensitive to these effects of Mp 704 and V-37 but not of Poza Rica 7832.

Smith) is the main pest of maize in Brazil and its control has been targeted by Bt maize hybrids. Generally, Bt maize hybrids possess the transgenic locus in a hemizygous condition, that is, containing only one copy of the Bt allele. However, studies have shown that maize hybrids with an additional transgenic allele, namely, in a homozygous state, increases transgenic protein expression. Our aim in this study was to evaluate whether the transgenic event TC1507 x MON89034 x NK603 in homozygosis increases Bt protein expression levels and, consequently, reduces S. frugiperda leaf-feeding injury and larval survival which affects maize grain yield. Leaf-feeding injury of S. frugiperda was 29% lower on homozygous hybrids relative to their isogenic hemizygous versions. Isogenic homozygous and hemizygous hybrids did not differ in grain yield in this study. S. frugiperda survivorship on homozygous hybrids was significantly lower than on their hemizygous isogenic versions (16.9% and 38.5%, respectively). Homozygous hybrids presented higher Cry1F, Cry1A.105, and Cry2Ab2 protein expression levels relative to their isogenic hemizygous versions (approximately 1.5-, 2.0-, and 2.5-fold, respectively). The Bt maize event TC1507 x MON89034 x NK603 in a homozygous state increases Bt protein expression levels and the control of S. frugiperda. Therefore, the deployment of homozygous transgenic maize hybrids to farmers is more desirable than the hemizygous versions.

The control methods studied were a chemical insecticide, Beauveria bassiana Vuillemin (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycete), and a transgenic corn hybrid. The experimental study showed that B. bassiana control was similar to chemical control. The transgenic hybrid control was always very high throughout the corn cycle studied. A substantial decrease of B. bassiana and chemical control efficacy was observed with an increase in the delay between treatment and infestation. The complementary studies of B, bassiana persistence, control impact, and pathogen contact showed control-larval behavior interactions, which could explain this decrease in efficacy. To take into account the main factors that condition control efficacy, a modular and mechanistic model was proposed to describe larval dynamic and control impact. The proposed control model made it possible to integrate O. nubilalis dynamics, and thus to describe the time response of control.

Oviposition preference was determined in twochoice tests with maize and Napier grass in the laboratory while larval survival was determined under greenhouse conditions. Twenty- one different Napier varieties and P. purpureum x P. glaucum hybrids were evaluated and compared to maize in these bioassays. The varieties were collected from nurseries, from the wild and from farmers using them as a source of animal fodder. Results from two- choice tests indicated that Napier grasses were highly preferred for oviposition by C. partellus moths. However, Napier grasses were poor larval hosts, and a rapid decline in larval numbers was observed during the first week after egg hatch. Larval survival on maize was significantly higher than on Napier grass where virtually no larvae survived. The evaluated Napier grass varieties therefore have the characteristics required of trap crops. Preference for oviposition on hairy leaf surfaces of Napier grass instead of maize was most likely influenced by leaf volatiles since oviposition preference was negatively correlated to leaf hairiness.

The induced, STI-insensitive trypsins differed from the constitutive, STI sensitive trypsins in their susceptibility to inhibitors based on sizes, suggesting that the induced enzymes limited access to their active site by blocking bulky inhibitors. Twenty midgut cDNA fragments' were amplified using trypsin-specific PCR primers and at least twelve were shown to encode structurally diverse trypsins. High sequence diversity was observed for both the enzymes encoded by STI-induced mRNAs and those from larvae that had not been exposed to STI. Northern blots showed that midgut mRNAs hybridizing to various trypsin cDNA probes were either transcribed de novo or up-regulated following ingestion of STI. Southern hybridizations indicated the presence of multiple trypsin gene families in the insect genomes. The complete sequence of a trypsin gene(1) from A. ipsilon (AiT9) revealed the presence of three introns. Comparison of 5' upstream sequences' from AiT9 and AiT6 genes from A. ipsilon revealed putative TATA box and disparate regulatory motifs, within 500 bp of each translational start site.

Here we focus on the poorly known endemic leaf-mining moth genus Philodoria (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae), whose species feed on a diversity of Hawaiian plant lineages, many of which are critically endangered. We use anchored hybrid enrichment to assemble the first phylogenomic dataset (507 loci) for any Hawaiian animal taxon. To uncover the timing and pattern of diversification of these moths, we apply two frequently used dating calibration strategies, biogeographic calibrations and secondary calibrations. Island calibrations on their own resulted in much younger and unrealistic dates compared to strategies that relied on secondary calibrations. Philodoria probably originated on the now partially sunken islands of Laysan or Lisianski, approximately 21 Ma, and were associated with host plants in the families Ebenaceae, Malvaceae or Primulaceae. Major feeding groups associated with specific host-plant families originated soon after the plants colonized the islands. Allopatric isolation and host shifts, in concert and independently, probably play major roles in the diversification of Philodoria. Our dating results indicate that Philodoria is among the oldest known Hawaiian arthropod lineages, and that island calibrations alone can lead to unrealistically young dates.

This study evaluated the efficacy of Bt maize expressing proteins Cry1F + Cry 1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 + Vip3Aa20 to control S. frugiperda under field conditions in Brazil. This Bt maize technology effectively managed seedling cutting injury, significantly reduced foliar feeding and achieved near 100% protection from kernel-feeding caused by both a Cry1F-resistant strain and a field-collected population of S. frugiperda. Consistent field-collected data across several years and planting regions suggest that this Bt maize technology will be an important tool for the effective management of all important feeding injury types caused by S. frugiperda in Brazil. As with any Bt maize hybrid, its implementation within IPM and IRM practices should help growers maintain maize crop sustainability in Brazil.

Consequently, temperate species have been confined to refugia during the glacial periods wherefrom they have recolonized warming northern habitats between ice ages. In this study, we compare the gene CYP405A2 between different populations of the common burnet moth Zygaena filipendulae from across the Western Palearctic region to illuminate the colonization history of this species. These data show two major clusters of Z.filipendulae populations possibly reflecting two different refugial populations during the last ice age. The two types of Z.filipendulae only co-occur in Denmark, Sweden, and Scotland indicating that Northern Europe comprise the hybridization zone where individuals from two different refugia met after the last ice age. Bayesian phylogeographic and ecological clustering analyses show that one cluster probably derives from an Alpe Maritime refugium in Southern France with ancestral expansive tendencies to the British Isles in the west, touching Northern Europe up to Denmark and Sweden, and extending throughout Central Europe into the Balkans, the Peleponnes, and South East Europe. The second cluster encompasses East Anatolia as the source area, from where multiple independent dispersal events to Armenia, to the Alborz mountains in north-western Iran, and to the Zagros mountains in western Iran are suggested. Consequently, the classical theory of refugia for European temperate species in the Iberian, Italian, and Balkan peninsulas does not fit with the data from Z.filipendulae populations, which instead support more Northerly, mountainous refugia.

A Comparison of Bt Transgene, Hybrid Background, Water Stress, and Insect Stress Effects on Corn Leaf and Ear Injury and Subsequent Yield	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						fall armyworm; corn earworm; Spodoptera frugiperda; Helicoverpa zea; Bt corn	EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; FALL ARMYWORM; NOCTUIDAE; CRY1F	Experimentally manipulated water and insect stresses were applied to field-grown corn with different Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenes and no Bt transgenes, and different nontransgenic hybrid backgrounds (2011 and 2012, Corpus Christi, TX). Differences in leaf injury, ear injury, and yield were detected among experimental factors and their interactions. Under high and low water stress, injury from noctuid larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on leaves during vegetative growth (primarily from fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith) and on developing ears (primarily from corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea [Boddie]) was lowest on more recent releases of Bt hybrids (newer Bt hybrids) expressing Cry1A. 105+Cry2Ab2 and Cry 3Bb1, compared with earlier Bt hybrids (older Bt hybrids) expressing Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 and non-Bt hybrids. High water stress led to increased leaf injury under substantial fall armyworm feeding pressure in 2011 (as high as 8.7 on a 1-9 scale of increasing injury). In contrast, ear injury by corn earworm (as high as 20 cm 2 of surface area of injury) was greater in low water stress conditions. Six hybrid backgrounds did not influence leaf injury, while ear injury differences across hybrid backgrounds were detected for non-Bt and older Bt hybrid versions. While newer Bt hybrids expressing Cry1A. 105+Cry2Ab2 and Cry 3Bb1 had consistent low leaf injury and high yield and low but less consistent ear injury across six hybrid backgrounds, water stress was a key factor that influenced yield. Bt transgenes played a more variable and lesser role when interacting with water stress to affect yield. These results exemplify the interplay of water and insect stress with plant injury and yield, their interactions with Bt transgenes, and the importance of these interactions in considering strategies for Bt transgene use where water stress is common.

Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus females do select the best hosts for rapid larval growth in Alaska and in southern Michigan, but not in northern Michigan and southern Ohio. In addition to latitudinal patterns, local host preferences of P. canadensis are described in relation to "phenological twisting" of leaf suitability for larval growth in cold pockets with "thermally constrained" growing season lengths. White ash leaves (Fraxinus americana) have the highest nutritional quality (relative to cherry, aspen, birch, and other local trees) throughout June and July for P. canadensis populations inside the cold pocket, but not outside. In all areas outside the cold pockets, even with bud-break occurring much later than other tree species, ash leaves rapidly decline in quality after mid-June and become one of the worse tree host species for larvae. This temperature-driven phenology difference creates a geographic mosaic in host plant suitability for herbivores. However, we also report here that the cold pocket of northern Michigan has basically disappeared since 1998. Implications of these changes are discussed in relation to voltinism and host plant selection. Various physiological and ecological adaptations to thermal unit constraints are evident with both species of naturally hybridizing butterflies (P. canadensis to the North and P. glaucus to the South). The rapid regional climate warming since 1998 in the Great Lakes region has allowed us to document some critical aspects of gene flow via analysis of independent "species-diagnostic" trait clines (including morphological, biochemical, and physiological characters). Narrower black bands on hind-wings, larger fore-wings, larval detoxification abilities for tulip tree leaves, behavioral preference of tulip tree leaves, and species-diagnostic allozymes such as PDG (x-linked) and HK (autosomal) provide evidence of these genodynamics. Laboratory hybridization studies (providing known reference groups) and field observations along the hybrid zone show that gene flow between P. glaucus and P. canadensis has recently been extensive across the historical hybrid zone.

Thus, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the impact of DeKalb 679 BTY Cry 1Ab (MON 810) and Garst 8600 BLT Cry 9C (CBH 351) transgenic grain on Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), and Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier), survival, development and fecundity. Eggs of Indianmeal moth or Angoumois grain moth were added to cracked or whole kernel corn. Emergence and fecundity were recorded for 5 wks. Emergence and fecundity of both moth species was reduced on both Cry 1Ab and Cry 9C-transformed corn, but only Cry 1Ab-transformed corn delayed development of Indianmeal moth. Results indicate that populations of these moths may be negatively impacted in grain bins by Bt corn hybrids and that lepidopteran populations should be monitored in field-scale assays to examine the effects of the presence of Bt corn hybrids on insects in storage environments.

The 31 prophase bivalents differ in size but bear few physical characteristics that allow a karyotype. Gypsy moth females are the heterogametic ses and we suggest possible elements of the ZW pair. The meiotic prophases are achiasmate, but the chromosomes are tightly synapsed throughout prophase. A diffuse stage occurs, during which some chromosomes bear chromomeres. Male prophases are chiasmate. Meiosis of interracial hybrid females are normal and do not show evidence of heteromorphic bivalents, inversions, or translocations. Division anomalies are prevalent in the males, most anaphase figures representing unbalanced segregations. These observations are discussed in relation to efforts to characterize the gypsy moth genome.

Limitations in the present conventional and transgenic approaches have made it crucial to develop sustainable and environmental friendly methods for crop improvement. In the present study, host-induced RNA interference (HI-RNAi) approach was used to develop H. armigera resistant tobacco and tomato plants. Chitinase (HaCHI) gene, critically required for insect molting and metamorphosis was selected as a potential target. Hair-pin RNAi construct was prepared from the conserved off-target free partial HaCHI gene sequence and was used to generate several HaCHI-RNAi tobacco and tomato plants. Northern hybridization confirmed the production of HaCHI gene-specific siRNAs in HaCHI-RNAi tobacco and tomato lines. Continuous feeding on leaves of RNAi lines drastically reduced the target gene transcripts and consequently, affected the overall growth and survival of H. armigera. Various developmental deformities were also manifested in H. armigera larvae after feeding on the leaves of RNAi lines. These results demonstrated the role of chitinase in insect development and potential of HI-RNAi for effective management of H. armigera.	[Mamta; Rajam, M.

Moench, hybrids in field experiments in central Texas in 1985 and 1986. The hybrids were commercially acceptable types, similar agronomically and developmentally but differing in degree of panicle compactness at maturity. Almost all oviposition on panicles occurred just before and during flowering. Subsequent larval stages were associated with progressive stages of panicle development. Significantly more com earworm eggs and larvae were recovered from panicles of the compact-panicle hybrid than the loose-panicle hybrid. However, life table construction revealed that the distribution and level of egg and larval mortality were similar for com earworm on either panicle type. Data from all experiments revealed that real mortality (r(x)) was >98% by the end of the last larval stage, and was >90% during the egg and small larval stages. Parasitism by Trichogramma spp. and failure to hatch caused the greatest amount of egg mortality. Few parasitized larvae were found. Disease-induced larval mortality was low but was highest among large larvae. The greater number of larvae recovered from sorghum with compact panicles than those with loose panicles was a function of the greater number of eggs deposited on those panicles. Significant relationships existed between abundance of large larvae (>24 mm) and that of small and medium larvae. Equations were derived to predict densities of large corn earworm larvae on sorghum panicles based upon densities of earlier com earworm life stages.

La Selva to obtain a hybrid with tolerance to the fruit borer Neoleucinodes elegantalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and to the nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White) (Nematoda: Heteroderidae), to obtain better-adapted plants to the conditions of the Colombian coffee-growing region and with bigger and non-dehiscent fruits. La Selva cultivar is a hybrid developed from the interspecific backcross of Solanum quitoense Lam. x Solanum hirtum Vahl with plants of lulo cv. Castilla Larga Vida. The experiment was conducted in the municipality of Dosquebradas, Risaralda, Colombia, located at 1,465 m a.s.l. F-1 plants were obtained from reciprocal crossings. When inoculated with the nematode M. incognita, plants showed susceptibility. in their seedling stage; however, when we carried out the evaluation six months after transplantation under field conditions, nematode infestation was less than 1%, which likely indicates the tolerance of these materials to the nematode. When assessing the resistance of the hybrid to the attack of N. elegantalis, we found that the evaluated materials were resistant to this insect. The resulting hybrids showed good agronomic characteristics, such as a good morphological structure and vigor, high productivity, good solar exposure adaptation, large fruits (5.6 cm average diameter) similar to those of cv. Castilla, with yellow peel, green pulp and non-dehiscent fruits with pleasant aroma and flavor. As an undesirable characteristic plants had thorns on leaves and stems.

In this study we evaluated the effect of phenological stage, transgenes and genetic composition of maize on endophytic bacterial and fungal communities. The maize populations were composed of a local variety named Rosado ( RS) and three isogenic hybrids. One isogenic hybrid was not genetically modified ( NGM). Another hybrid ( Hx) contained the transgenes cry1F and pat ( T1507 event), which provide resistance to insects of the order Lepidoptera and tolerance to the glufosinate-ammonium herbicide, respectively. The third hybrid ( Hxrr) contained the transgene cp4 epsps ( NK603 event) combined with the transgenes cry1F and pat ( T1507 event), which allow tolerance to the Roundup Ready herbicide, besides the characteristics of Hx. Evaluation of the foliar tissue was done through PCR-DGGE analysis, with specific primers for bacteria and fungi within four phenological stages of maize. The endophytic bacteria were only clustered by phenological stages; the structure of the fungal community was clustered by maize genotypes in each phenological stage. The fungal community from the local variety RS was different from the three hybrids ( NGM, Hx and Hxrr) within the four evaluated stages. In the reproductive stage, the fungal community from the two transgenic hybrids ( Hx and Hxrr) were separated, and the Hxrr was different from NGM, in the two field experiments. This research study showed that the genetic composition of the maize populations, especially the presence of transgenes, is the determining factor for the changes detected in the endophytic fungal community of maize leaves.

The E and Z isomers were formulated in E:Z ratios of 99:1, 97:3, 65:35, and 3:97. Trap capture data indicated that the E pheromone strain of the ECB was predominant at Florence and the Z strain was predominant at Clemson. Both strains appeared to occur sympatrically at Newberry. Pheromone analysis of 46 ECB female moths at Florence indicated that 43 were the E strain and 3 were hybrids. The 99E:1Z pheromone blend captured over four times as many male moths as the 97E:3Z blend at Florence. The 65E:35Z blend captured 5%, 11%, and 12% of the moths at Florence, Newberry, and Clemson, respectively, indicating the possible presence of hybrid moths. The superior performance of the 99E:1Z blend of 11-tetradecenyl acetate should enhance the development of a more effective lure for the E strain of the ECB.

Geographic Distribution of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1F Toxin Resistance in Western Bean Cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Populations in the United States	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						insecticidal protein toxin; resistance	ALBICOSTA SMITH LEPIDOPTERA; FIELD-EVOLVED RESISTANCE; TRANSGENIC CORN HYBRIDS; ECONOMIC INJURY LEVELS; INSECT RESISTANCE; SEED MIXTURES; SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA; BT MAIZE; RANGE EXPANSION; SURVIVAL	The western bean cutworm (WBC), Striacosta albicosta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), can be a severe pest of transgenic corn in the western Plains and Great Lakes regions of North America, including on hybrids expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1F toxin. The level and geographic distribution of Cry1F resistance are not completely known. Neonate S. albicosta from 10 locations between Nebraska and New York state were subjected to dose-response trypsin-activated native Cry1F toxin overlay bioassays. In 2017, the mean estimated lethal concentration causing 50% larval mortality (LC50) ranged from 15.1 to 18.4 mu g Cry1F cm(-2), and were not significantly different among locations. In 2018, LC50 estimates at Scottsbluff, NE (22.0 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)) and Watertown, NY (21.7 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)) were significantly higher when compared to locations in Michigan (15.8 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)). Significantly lower 14-day larval weight among survivors was correlated with higher Cry1F dose. Results from this study indicate that S. albicosta survivorship on purified Bt Cry1F toxin shows a relatively even distribution across the native and range expansion areas where seasonal field infestations typically occur.

The current study aimed to identify bivoltine breeds tolerant of the high temperature conditions that occur in the tropics. Percentage pupation at high temperatures and heat shock responses of silkworms were used as measures of thermotolerance. Thermotolerance of 20 silkworm breeds was assessed by rearing them at 36 degrees C. Based on percentage pupation, three breeds, namely Nistari (multivoltine), SK4C (bivoltine) and CSR2 (bivoltine) were designated tolerant, moderately tolerant and susceptible, respectively. To understand the heat shock responses and the molecular mechanisms underlying thermotolerance, the tissue specific expression profiles of the nine heat shock protein (Hsp) genes were determined in the three breeds after a heat shock of 1 h at 36 degrees C and a 2 h recovery period by performing real-time qPCR. The level of expression of Hsp genes was significantly increased in heat shocked tissues and gradually decreased during the recovery period. The greatest increase in the expression of Hsp genes was recorded in fat body followed by mid gut and silk gland. Of the three breeds, Nistari showed the highest expression of Hsp genes and SK4C a moderate expression relative to CSR2. The qPCR results showed that the transcript levels of sHsp20.4 and 20.1, and Hsp70 were increased by 10.3, 9.7 and 2.3 times, respectively, in Nistari compared to CSR2. Similarly the expression of sHsp20.4 and 20.1, and Hsp70 were increased by 3.5, 2.3 and 1.5 times, respectively in SK4C compared to CSR2. The expression levels of Hsps during heat shock corresponded to the percentage pupation recorded for the three breeds at a high temperature. It is suggested that the Hsps and their levels of expression may play an important role in increasing the survival of silkworm larvae at high temperatures. This study identified SK4C as a bivoltine breed, which is highly tolerant of high temperature measured in terms of percentage pupation (of the bivoltine breeds) and higher levels of expression of Hsp genes compared to CSR2. The importance of SK4C as a thermotolerant bivoltine parent for breeding new bivoltine hybrids tolerant of high temperatures is discussed.

Female moths of S. c. ricini mated with males of the same subspecies deposited eggs. About 75% of the total number of eggs were laid during the dark phases of days 1 and 2 after copulation. In virgin females, oviposition occurred mainly on days 3 to 8 after emergence. The average number of eggs in each egg mass of S. c. ricini and S. c. Pryeri was about 10 and 25, respectively. The number of eggs per egg mass of S. c. ricini was large, and sometimes more than 100 were laid in concentrated large masses (L-type). On the other hand, female S. c. pryeri laid widely-scattered egg masses in small groups of 1 to 10 eggs (S-type). Inter-subspecific reciprocal crossing produced F1 progenies with differential oviposition patterns. The average number of eggs per egg mass from S. c. ricini (female) x S. c. pryeri (male) was about 28. (Each mass was of the S-type.) However, the number from S. c. pryeri (female) x S. c. ricini (male) was about 14. (Each mass was of the L-type.) These results suggest that the gene(s) controlling oviposition behavior is located on the sex chromosome.

Introgression as a likely cause of mtDNA paraphyly in two allopatric skippers (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae)	HEREDITY			English	Article						allopatric distribution; Erynnis horatius; Erynnis propertius; organelle capture; introgression; mtDNA	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HAPLOTYPE RECONSTRUCTION; WOLBACHIA INFECTION; DROSOPHILA-SIMULANS; POPULATION-GENETICS; FLIES DIPTERA; SPECIATION; NUCLEAR; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTIONARY	Gene transfer between species during interspecific hybridization is a widely accepted reality in plants but is considered a relatively rare phenomenon among animals. Here we describe a unique case of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) paraphyly in the skipper genus, Erynnis, that involves well-diverged allopatric species. Using molecular evidence from both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, we found high levels of intraspecific divergence in the mitochondrial genome within E. propertius (over 4% pair-wise sequence divergence) but no such differentiation in the nuclear genome. Sequence comparisons with related Erynnis suggest that past, but recent and infrequent introgression between E. propertius and E. horatius is the most reasonable explanation for the observed pattern of mtDNA paraphyly. This example of putative introgression highlights the complexity of mtDNA evolution and suggests that similar processes could be operating in other taxa that have not been extensively sampled. Our observations reinforce the importance of involving multiple genes with different modes of inheritance in the analysis of population history of congeneric taxa.

Attraction, Feeding Preference, and Performance of Spodoptera frugiperda Larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Reared on Two Varieties of Maize	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						fall armyworm; host searching; development; maize; landrace	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION; CHILO-PARTELLUS; BALSAS TEOSINTE; LEAF TOUGHNESS; PLANT DEFENSE; RESISTANCE; DOMESTICATION; OVIPOSITION; BEHAVIOR	The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an economically important pest of maize and other crops in the Americas. Studies suggest that modern varieties of maize lost some of their natural defense mechanisms against herbivores during domestication and agricultural selection. In the present study, we evaluated the attraction, feeding preference (host fidelity and consumption rate), and performance of S. frugiperda larvae reared on hybrid (Pioneer P4063W) and landrace (Tuxpeno) varieties of maize. We also evaluated the damage caused by S. frugiperda to Pioneer and Tuxpeno maize plants in the field. We found that fifth-instar larvae were more attracted to Pioneer plants than to Tuxpeno plants in a Y-tube olfactometer. Additionally, the fall armyworm larvae showed more fidelity to Pioneer leaves than to Tuxpeno leaves. However, the larval consumption rate was similar for both types of maize plants. The life cycle of S. frugiperda was significantly longer when the larvae were reared on Tuxpeno leaves than on Pioneer leaves. In the field, the Pioneer variety was infested with more S. frugiperda larvae than the Tuxpeno variety. Thus, our results provide evidence that modern varieties of maize may have lost some of their defensive traits during selective breeding.

Flooding and Herbivory Interact to Alter Volatile Organic Compound Emissions in Two Maize Hybrids	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Flooding; Herbivory; Maize; Stress-inducing factors; Volatile organic compounds	INDUCED PLANT VOLATILES; ABIOTIC STRESSES; POLLUTED ATMOSPHERES; CARBON ALLOCATION; LEAF VOLATILES; COMPOUNDS VOCS; RAPID CHANGES; RESISTANCE; RESPONSES; DROUGHT	Flooding is a major plant abiotic stress factor that is frequently experienced by plants simultaneously with other biotic stresses, including herbivory. How plant volatile emissions, which mediate interactions with a wide range of organisms, are influenced by flooding and by multiple co-occurring stress factors remains largely unexplored. Using Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (fall armyworm) as the insect pest and two maize (Zea mays, L. Poaceae) hybrids differentially marketed for conventional and organic production, we assessed the effects of flooding, herbivory, and both stress factors on the composition of blends of emitted volatiles. Headspace volatiles were collected from all treatment combinations seven days after flooding. We documented metrics indicative of biomass allocation to determine the effects of individual and combined stressors on plant growth. We also evaluated relationships between volatile emissions and indicators of soil chemical characteristics as influenced by treatment factors. Flooding and herbivory induced the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in similar ways on both maize hybrids, but the interaction of both stress factors produced significantly larger quantities of emitted volatiles. Thirty-eight volatile compounds were identified, including green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, an aldehyde, a benzoate ester, sesquiterpenes, a diterpene alcohol, and alkane hydrocarbons. The hybrid marketed for organic production was a stronger VOC emitter. As expected, plant biomass was detrimentally affected by flooding. Soil chemical properties were less responsive to the treatment factors. Taken together, the results suggest that flooding stress and the interactions of flooding and insect attack can shape the emission of plant volatiles and further influence insect-plant interactions.

The corn hybrids were exposed to natural seasonal fluctuations of a bivoltine ecotype European corn borer population. Larval injury parameters, grain yields, and gross incomes were quantified during the 3-yr study. The use of either Bt hybrids or whorl-applied permethrin granules resulted in significant yield advantages in only 1 out of 3 yr of performance testing. Under high corn borer pressure in 1997, the performances of the Bt corn hybrids and permethrin-treated isolines were similar, and significantly better than the untreated isolines. However, injury-free corn did not necessarily translate into higher yields in some of the hybrid groups. Grain moisture at harvest, which can result in moisture penalty,or dockage, was significantly higher in some Bt corn hybrids. Neither the Bt hybrids nor the permethrin-treated isolines produced significant advantages in yields in 1998 and 1999 when infestations of first-generation corn borer were almost nonexistent and infestations of second-generation European corn borers were moderate.

The present study aims to elucidate the genetic changes involved during the process of host shifts, by combining analyses for (1) host adaptations, (2) pre- and postmating isolation, and (3) phylogeney among populations, using a leaf-mining moth, Acrocercops transecta. This species is associated with Juglans ailanthifolia and Lyonia ovalifolia. Transplantation of the larvae demonstrated that the Juglans-associated population completely failed to survive on Lyonia, whereas the Lyonia-associated population survived on Juglans as well as on Lyonia. Females of respective host-associated populations oviposited on their natal host plant only. An mtDNA-based phylogeny clearly separated the Lyonia-associated population from the Juglandaceae-associated population, and indicated that the Lyonia-associated population once evolved from the Juglandaceae-associated population. These results indicate that the processes of host shifting from juglandaceous species to Lyonia involved genetic changes both in larval ability to use host plants and in host preference of females. The derived Lyonia-associated population has retained the potential to assimilate the ancestral host, Juglandaceae. Mating between the two host-associated populations was successful for both directions of crossing, and there were no significant differences in egg hatchability between hybrids and control crosses. No adults emerged when the F-1 hybrid larvae were maintained on Lyonia; however, on Juglans the F-1 hybrid larvae grew to adulthood as well as in the control, suggesting a lack of genomic incompatibilities between the two host-associated populations. In conclusion, the results showed that the two host-associated populations are host races that are partially reproductively isolated, and that the differences in performance and preference function as strong barriers against gene flow between the host races.

Oviposition preference, larval orientation, settling, arrest and dispersal, feeding, mortality and survival, and development were determined for each of these varieties under laboratory and screen house conditions. Two-choice tests showed that only two of the varieties tested (cv. Bana and cv. Uganda Hairless) were preferentially chosen by gravid female moths for oviposition over a susceptible maize variety, cv. Western Hybrid 502. Larval preference was, however, highly variable. Larval feeding by first instars on the maize leaves was more intense and significantly more than on leaves of all the Napier grass varieties evaluated. Food consumed and amounts assimilated by the third instars over a 24-h period were not different among larvae fed on stems of maize and those fed on stems of the various Napier grass varieties. Larval survival was significantly lower on all the Napier grass varieties (below 3%) than on maize (about 44%). Similarly, larval development was about 2-3 weeks longer on majority of the Napier grass varieties. It was concluded that cv. Bana had potential for use as a trap plant in the management of B. fusca because it was more preferred by the moths for oviposition, equally preferred as maize by the larvae for orientation, settling, and arrest, and allowed minimal survival of the larvae. It can thus be used with such 'push' plants as Desmodium spp. (Fabaceae) in a 'push-pull' strategy, but the effectiveness of such a strategy would strictly depend on proper establishment and management of these companion plants.

Evaluation of Tolerance to Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins Among Laboratory-Reared Western Bean Cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bacillus thuringiensis; western bean cutworm; transgenic corn; toxin; dose-Dresponse assay	HELICOVERPA-ZEA LEPIDOPTERA; ALBICOSTA SMITH LEPIDOPTERA; TRANSGENIC CORN HYBRIDS; INSECTICIDAL PROTEIN; RESISTANCE; BOLLWORM; COTTON; BT; SURVIVAL; EFFICACY	The western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a destructive insect pest of dry beans and corn within its native range of western Nebraska and eastern Colorado. However, since the initiation of an eastward range expansion of S. albicosta in the late 1990s, economic damage has been observed in the Midwest, and the species has now reached the Atlantic Coast and Quebec. Economic damage to corn occurs by larval feeding on ears, which is not controlled by commercial transgenic hybrids that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1Ab, but partial control is observed by corn varieties that express Cry1 F toxins. Inadequate protocols for laboratory rearing of S. albicosta have hindered controlled efficacy experimentation in the laboratory and field. We report an S. albicosta rearing methodology used to maintain a laboratory colony for 12 continuous generations. Rearing procedures were adapted for Bt toxin diet-overlay assays, revealing that S. albicosta larvae exposed to Bt toxin for 14 d were insensitive to Cry1Ab concentrations up to 25,000 ng/cm(2). In contrast, neonates exposed to Cry1 F toxin at >= 250 ng/cm(2), showed reduced developmental rates, with estimated effective concentrations of EC50 = 1,187.5 ng/cm(2) and EC95 = 10,000.5 ng/cm(2). The ability to mass produce this pest insect will enhance fundamental research, including evaluation of control tactics and toxin susceptibility.

Evaluation of corn hybrids expressing Cry1F (Herculex (R) I insect protection) against fall armyworm (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) in the southern United States	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Cry1F; Bacillus thuringiensis; var. aizawai; transgenic corn; Spodoptera frugiperda; TC1507	SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA; LARVAE LEPIDOPTERA; BORER LEPIDOPTERA; TRANSGENIC CORN; RESISTANCE; COTTON; CRAMBIDAE	Efficacy of two insect-resistant corn hybrids expressing the Cry1F insecticidal crystal protein of Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai Berliner (transformation event TC1507) was evaluated against fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), in three southern U.S. locations. Larval susceptibility was evaluated on Cry1F and nonBt field corn, Zea mays L., plants (V3-V12 and R1-R2 stages) in field plots and laboratory studies. Leaf-feeding injury was significantly less and plant height was significantly greater for hybrids containing Cry1F as compared with nonBt corn hybrids when exposed to natural or artificial fall armyworm infestations. In addition, larval mortality was significantly greater on Cry1F corn hybrids compared with that on nonBt hybrids. These results demonstrate that corn hybrids containing Cry1F represent an effective plant incorporated insecticidal protein management option for fall armyworm. In environments where fall armyworm may exceed damage thresholds and have to be carefully managed with foliar sprays, utilization of Cry1F corn hybrids will allow growers flexibility in planting and an efficient means for managing infestations.

Leaf Alkaloids, Phenolics, and Coffee Resistance to the Leaf Miner Leucoptera coffeella (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						antiobiosis; caffeine; caffeic acid; chlorogenic acid; Coffea	PERILEUCOPTERA-COFFEELLA	Coffee (Coffea spp.) alkaloids (caffeine and related methylxanthines) and phenolics (caffeic and chlorogenic acids) have recognized pestistatic/pesticidal activity and mediate insect-plant interactions. The present investigation assessed the resistance of 12 coffee genotypes to the leaf miner Leucoptera (=Perileucoptera) coffeella (Guerin-Meneville & Perrottet) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) and correlated such results with the leaf content of coffee alkaloids and phenolics that probably play a role in the interaction between coffee and this leaf miner. The levels of chlorogenic and caffeic acid, caffeine, and related methylxanthines were measured and quantified in leaf extracts of these genotypes before and 7 d after their infestation by the leaf miner. Some coffee genotypes (Coffea canephora L. and Coffea racemosa Lour. and its hybrids with Coffea arabica L.) exhibited high pesticidal activity (100% mortality) toward the L. coffeella, indicating their antibiosis resistance. However, there was no correlation between this activity and the leaf levels of coffee alkaloids and phenolics. Curiously, infestation by L. coffeella leads to a nearly four-fold decline in the leaf levels of chlorogenic acid, which does not affect this pest species but may affect other generalist species. Indeed, chlorogenic acid sprayed on coffee leaves stimulated locomotory activity of the green scale Coccus viridis (Green) (Hemiptera: Coccidae), thus minimizing their feeding in contrast with the absence of this polyphenol. Therefore, reduction of chlorogenic acid levels in coffee leaves due to leaf miner infestation seems to also favor infestation by generalist insects, such as the green scale.	[Guedes, R. N.

Impact of Simulated Corn Earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Kernel Feeding on Field Corn Yield	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						field corn; kernel damage; corn earworm	PYRAMIDED BT TRAITS; FALL ARMYWORM; HYBRIDS; INJURY; CRY1F; CRY1A.105; CRAMBIDAE; CRY2AB2; REFUGE; TOXINS	Corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) Lepidoptera: Noctuidae, has not been considered an economic pest of field corn. Historical losses estimates ranged from 1.5 to 2.5%, and a large number of foliar insecticide applications would be needed to minimize infestations. In recent years, Bt, Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) field corn, Zea mays (L.) Poales: Poaceae, technologies that exhibit activity against corn earworm have been introduced. However, it is unclear how much damage to corn ears (number of damaged kernels) is required to reduce yield. In this study manual damage methods were utilized to inflict defined levels of kernel damage and to impose damage at levels greater than observed with natural corn earworm infestations. Bt corn hybrids expressing the Agrisure Viptera (Vip 3A) trait were used to minimize injury from natural infestations of corn earworm. Manual kernel damage was imposed at R3 stage to mimic corn earworm feeding while avoiding interference with pollination. These methods were used in experiments where treatments were applied to individual ears and hand-harvested and in experiments where treatments were applied to all primary ears in the plot and machine-harvested. Damage of >= 60 kernels per ear was required to significantly reduce yield regardless of harvest method. Kernel damage from natural corn earworm infestations reported in other studies was much lower than 60 kernels per ear. Timely planting is a key component of all integrated pest management programs. Field corn planted during the recommended planting window for optimum yield is unlikely to experience corn earworm damage great enough to reduce yield.	[Olivi, B. M.; Gore, J.; Cook, D.

The interspecies transfer of the symbiont Wolbachia has been thought to have occurred repeatedly, facilitating its observed global pandemic. Few ecological interactions have been proposed as potential routes for the horizontal transfer of Wolbachia within natural insect communities. These routes are however likely to act only at the local scale, but how they may support the global distribution of some Wolbachia strains remains unclear. Results: Here, we characterize the Wolbachia diversity in butterflies from the tropical forest regions of central Africa to discuss transfer at both local and global scales. We show that numerous species from both the Mylothris (family Pieridae) and Bicyclus (family Nymphalidae) butterfly genera are infected with similar Wolbachia strains, despite only minor interclade contacts across the life cycles of the species within their partially overlapping ecological niches. The phylogenetic distance and differences in resource use between these genera rule out the role of ancestry, hybridization, and shared host-plants in the interspecies transfer of the symbiont. Furthermore, we could not identify any shared ecological factors to explain the presence of the strains in other arthropod species from other habitats, or even ecoregions. Conclusion: Only the systematic surveys of the Wolbachia strains from entire species communities may offer the material currently lacking for understanding how Wolbachia may transfer between highly different and unrelated hosts, as well as across environmental scales.

Using a new coalescent-based approach, we show that there is significant heterogeneity in estimated divergence times among five Z-linked markers, rejecting a purely allopatric speciation model. We infer that the Z chromosome is a mosaic of regions that differ in the extent of historical gene flow, potentially due to isolating barriers that prevent the introgression of species-specific traits that result in hybrid incompatibilities. Surprisingly, a candidate region for a strong barrier to introgression, Ldh, does not show a significantly deeper divergence time than other markers on the Z chromosome. Our approach can be used to test alternative models of speciation and can potentially assign chronological order to the appearance of factors contributing to reproductive isolation between species.

Cry1Da was the most toxic, followed by Cry1Ab, Cry1Ba, and Cry1Ac, while Cry1Aa, Cry1Fa, Cry1Ia, and SN19 were still less active. Cry1Ca and Cry1Cb showed no activity. In vitro trypsin activation increased activity of all eight active delta-endotoxins, and dramatically enhanced toxicity of hybrid SN19, Cry1Aa, Cry1Ac, and Cry1Fa. The differences between toxicity of proteins before and after trypsin digestion suggests that proteolytic activation in the C. pomonella digestive tract plays a critical role for the activity of Cry proteins against this insect.

But sometimes, necessity arises for the sexual differentiation of immature stages like larvae so that virgin females can be studied. Here, we present a straightforward, reliable, and non-invasive method that permits sexing of Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders, 1844) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) larvae during their fourth instar. Male P. gossypiella larvae are identified by their testes, which are visible through the dorsal integument of the abdominal segments. The testes are observed as two dark elliptical bodies, one on either side of the midline of the fifth abdominal segment in the fourth instar of P. gossypiella. Length and width of the individual testes was measured as 653.33 +/- 5.68 and 484.89 +/- 4.34 mu m, respectively, in P. gossypiella. After separation of live male larvae by these characters, they were transferred into separate vials and emerged adults were identified to ascertain correct identification of the males. We observed that all the larvae with dark-coloured testes visible to the naked eye in their fifth abdominal segment during the fourth instar developed into male moths and all other larvae without this character developed into female moths. The visual sexing of male and female larvae of P. gossypiella could save time in separating the sexes to carry out studies on sex-specific responses, hybrid mating, and/or inheritance of insecticide resistance.

Corn Hybrids and Planting Dates Affect Yield Losses by Helicoverpa zea and Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Feeding on Ears in Mexico	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						maize; corn earworm; fall armyworm; kernel color; crop loss assessment	EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; FALL ARMYWORM; RESISTANCE; MAYSIN; DAMAGE; MAIZE	The effect of hybrid and planting date on yield losses by the corn ear insects Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) was determined in northeastern Mexico, from 2006 - 2009. Eight corn hybrids (white and yellow) were planted each year during early January, February and March. Regardless of year, hybrid, or planting date, the most abundant ear insect was H. zea (61 - 99%). Yield losses varied greatly according to year, hybrid and planting date, with a maximum of 596 kg/ha, equivalent to 10.6% of total yield. Regarding planting dates, yield losses were lower in February, greater in March, and intermediate in January, probably attributed to host plant availability for ear insects in the region. An average of 74% greater yield loss was observed in yellow hybrids as compared with white hybrids for all planting dates, probably because of a differential grain hardness and husk wrap. According to current local value of corn grain and cost of insecticide and aerial application, insecticide treatment of lepidopterans attacking corn ears would have not been justified during this study.

This loss has been particularly severe in the UK with extensive localised extinctions. Following sympathetic management, reintroduction was undertaken at four Cumbria (northern UK) sites in 2007 with stock from a captive admixture population descended from Cumbrian and Scottish founders. Annual population monitoring of the reintroductions was undertaken. Nine years post-reintroduction, the level of population genetic variation was assessed using microsatellites. Variation in historical Cumbrian samples was determined using museum samples and Scottish samples from current populations were assayed to characterise natural population variation. Half of the Scottish sites also served as indicators of the alleles present in the founder populations. The genetic contribution of the founder populations allied to population size data allowed patterns of genetic variation to be modelled. Alleles from Cumbrian and Scottish founders are present in the reintroduced populations. The four sites have levels of variation akin to natural populations and exhibit differentiation as predicted by statistical modelling and comparable with natural populations. This suggests that reintroduction following captive breeding can produce self-sustaining populations with natural levels of genetic diversity. These populations appear to be undergoing the same evolutionary dynamics with bottlenecks and drift as natural populations. Implications for insect conservation Reintroduction of captive bred individuals is a viable strategy for producing populations with natural levels of genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics. Hybridisation of populations on the brink of extinction with those thriving can preserve some of the genetic distinctiveness of the declining population.

J	Paajanen, MPT; Cronk, Q				Paajanen, Mikko Pasi Tapani; Cronk, Quentin			Moth versus fly: a preliminary study of the pollination mode of two species of endemic Asteraceae from St Helena (Commidendrum robustum and C. rugosum) and its conservation implications	BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL			English	Article						endemic plants; conservation; interspecific hybridisation; gene flow; fragmented populations; myophily; phalaenophily	PLANTS; FLIES	Commidendrum robustum (Roxb.) DC. (St Helena gumwood) and C. rugosum (Dryand.) DC. (St Helena scrubwood) are ecologically important, endemic woody Asteraceae from the isolated South Atlantic island of St Helena. Once very abundant, they now exist in sparse fragmented populations due to 500 years of environmental destruction. They are sister taxa that evolved on the island and are reported to hybridise. Commidendrum rugosum has a saucer-like erect capitulum, whereas C. robustum has a somewhat globular hanging capitulum. Using daytime timelapse photography to follow capitula through their life cycle, we found that C. rugosum appears to be myophilous, visited largely by flies (including the endemic syrphid, Sphaerophoria beattiei Doesburg & Doesburg) and occasionally by Lepidoptera. Commidendrum robustum, on the other hand, although visited by flies, strongly attracts moths (especially noted at the Millennium Forest site). Our data suggest that moth visits may reduce visits from flies due to the sensitivity of flies to interference by other insects. We conclude that C. robustum may have a mixed syndrome of myophily/phalaenophily and that there is apparently some divergence of the pollination niche between the two species. Its potential in attracting moths, coupled with its former abundance, suggests that it may have been a major food source for adults of the numerous endemic moths. Pollinator activity was measured by insect visitation rates (mean visits per capitulum per day, V) and insect residence time (mean pollinator kiloseconds per capitulum per day, R). Both are higher for C. robusturn (C. rugosum, V = 16.4, R = 3.101; C. robusturn, V = 34.0, R = 8.274), reflecting the abundance of moths on the capitula at the Millennium Forest site. The conservation implications of the pollination mode are that: (1) there is considerable pollinator activity on the capitula and pollination is not currently a limiting factor for plant reproduction; (2) gene exchange between geographically-isolated populations of C. rugosum is likely to be minimal due to the apparent reliance of the species for pollination on small flies (especially Sphaerophoria beattiei), which are believed to be not effective as pollinators over long distances (> 1 km). A possible exception is the strong-flying drone-fly, Eristalis tenax Linn. which, although not as abundant as Sphaerophoria, does visit the flowers; (3) there is considerable overlap between the two species in flower visitors and interspecific pollen transfer is possible where the two species grow intermixed (which has potential positive and negative implications for species survival).

However, concerns have been raised regarding the possible undesirable effects of genetically modified crops on non-target organisms in the eco-system. Therefore, we studied the effects of transgenic cottons with cry1Ac gene from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) on the natural enemies of cotton bollworm/legume pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) under field and laboratory conditions. There was no apparent effect of transgenic cotton on the relative abundance of predatory spiders (Clubiona sp. and Neoscona sp.), coccinellid (Cheilomenes sexmaculatus Fab.), and the chrysopid (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens). However, the abundance of spiders, coccinellids, and chrysopids was quite low in insecticide protected plots towards end of the cropping season. There was a significant reduction in cocoon formation and adult emergence of the ichneumonid parasitoid, Campoletis chlorideae Uchnida reared on H. armigera larvae fed on the leaves of transgenic cottons before and after parasitization. However, no Bt toxins were detected in H. armigera larvae and the parasitoid cocoons with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Reduction in cocoon formation was because of early mortality of the H. armigera larvae due to Bt toxins in the leaves of transgenic cotton. There was a slight reduction in adult weight and fecundity, and prolongation of the larval period when the parasitoid was raised on H. armigera larvae fed on the leaves of transgenic cotton before and after parasitization. Survival and development of C. chlorideae was also poor when H. armigera larvae were fed on the leaves of cotton hybrid Mech 184. The adverse effects of transgenic cotton on survival and development of C. chlorideae were largely due to early mortality, and possibly poor nutritional quality of H. armigera larvae due to toxic effects of the transgene.

The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia; Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) is a prominent species in population biology but had no previous genomic data. Sequencing runs using two normalized complementary DNA collections from a genetically diverse pool of larvae, pupae, and adults yielded 608 053 expressed sequence tags (mean length = 110 nucleotides), which assembled into 48 354 contigs (sets of overlapping DNA segments) and 59 943 singletons. BLAST comparisons confirmed the accuracy of the sequencing and assembly, and indicated the presence of c. 9000 unique genes, along with > 6000 additional microarray-confirmed unannotated contigs. Average depth of coverage was 6.5-fold for the longest 4800 contigs (348-2849 bp in length), sufficient for detecting large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Oligonucleotide microarray probes designed from the assembled sequences showed highly repeatable hybridization intensity and revealed biological differences among individuals. We conclude that 454 sequencing, when performed to provide sufficient coverage depth, allows de novo transcriptome assembly and a fast, cost-effective, and reliable method for development of functional genomic tools for nonmodel species. This development narrows the gap between approaches based on model organisms with rich genetic resources vs. species that are most tractable for ecological and evolutionary studies.	[Vera, J.

C. exigua exhibits a very similar morphological phenotype and feeding behaviour to C. medinalis, another species of rice leaffolder whose genome was recently reported. However, genomic information for C. exigua remains extremely limited. Here, we used a hybrid strategy combining different sequencing technologies, including Illumina, PacBio, 10x Genomics, and Hi-C scaffolding, to generate a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of C. exigua. We initially obtained a 798.8 Mb assembly with a contig N50 size of 2.9 Mb, and the N50 size was subsequently increased to 25.7 Mb using Hi-C technology to anchor 1413 scaffolds to 32 chromosomes. We detected a total of 97.7% Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues (BUSCO) in the genome assembly, which was comprised of similar to 52% repetitive sequence and annotated 14,922 protein-coding genes. Of note, the Z and W sex chromosomes were assembled and identified. A comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that despite the high synteny observed between the two rice leaffolders, the species have distinct genomic features associated with expansion and contraction of gene families and selection pressure. In summary, our chromosome-level genome assembly and comparative genomic analysis of C. exigua provide novel insights into the evolution and ecology of this rice insect pests and offer useful information for pest control.

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Bt maize expressing Vip3Aa20 protein and pyramided Bt maize expressing proteins Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 + Vip3Aa20 provided excellent protection against kernel feeding by H. zea compared to Bt technologies expressing only Cry1F or Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2. Bt maize expressing Cry1F, Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2, Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2, and Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 + Vip3Aa20 resulted in less than 5% of plants injured by E. lignosellus, significantly less than Bt maize expressing only Vip3Aa20 and a non-Bt maize iso-hybrid with and without a thiamethoxam seed treatment. The highest protection against plant cutting injury caused by A. ipsilon was observed in the pyramid Bt maize technology expressing Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 + Vip3Aa20. However, it did not differ statistically from the Bt maize expressing Vip3Aa20, Cry1F, or Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2. All Bt maize hybrids evaluated in our study were highly effective in reducing tunneling injury caused by D. saccharalis. These results show that a new maize technology expressing pyramided Bt proteins Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 + Vip3Aa20 offers a higher level of protection from feeding by the above lepidopteran pest complex compared to maize with a single Bt protein or double pyramided Bt proteins.

A genomic library was constructed from embryonic DNA and screened with a homologous N-terminal probe from the JHE cDNA. Five genomic clones were isolated and analyzed by dot blot hybridization using regions of the JHE cDNA as probes. Clone C hybridized to both 5' and 3' probes from the JHE cDNA, suggesting that clone C contains both ends of JHE gene. This was verified by sequencing the ends of the JHE gene from clone C using primers from both the 5' and 3' ends of the JHE cDNA. Additional sequencing and restriction mapping were used to characterize the gene. The gene is c. 8 kb long and contains four introns with consensus intron-exon junctions. One of the introns is relatively large (4 kb) and is situated near the extreme 5' end of the gene. Genetic analysis of RFLP variation in interspecific and intraspecific crosses shows that the JHE locus is single-copy with no closely related paralogs and is autosomally encoded in Heliothis. Therefore the developmental pattern of expression of this gene and the previously documented sequence variation in cDNA clones is not explainable by reference to a JHE gene family with distinct structural loci for the different forms.

Nearly all the strains contained covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA species ranging from 2 to 5 species per strain and from 1.5 to 10.5 kbp in size (values corresponding to CCC forms). A 2-kbp plasmid from B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-3a3b futura strain was used in Southern hybridization experiments to analyse relationships among the low molecular mass plasmids of different B. thuringiensis strains. This 2-kbp miniplasmid was present in most strains which show toxicity against lepidoptera. It was not present in those strains toxic against diptera (B. thuringiensis var. israelensis) or coleoptera (B. thuringiensis var. tenebrionis). The 2-kbp miniplasmid from B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-3a3b futura was cloned and fully sequenced. Sequence analysis of the 2058 bp of the miniplasmid revealed the presence of an ORF (630 bp, 210 amino acids in size) that is preceded by a consensus sequence of B. thuringiensis crystal protein gene transcription promoters. No significant homology was observed with known B. thuringiensis toxin nucleic acid sequences or with other known sequences.

Impact of Lepidoptera (Crambidae, Noctuidae, and Pyralidae) Pests on Corn Containing Pyramided Bt Traits and a Blended Refuge in the Southern United States	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Helicoverpa zea; Spodoptera frugiperda; Bacillus thuringiensis; maize; Optimum Leptra	RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY; FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; BORER LEPIDOPTERA; SEED MIXTURES; INSECTICIDAL PROTEIN; LARVAL MOVEMENT; FIELD CORN; MAIZE; INFESTATION	Blended refuge for transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins has been approved in the northern United States as a resistance management strategy alternative to a structured refuge. A three-year study (2012-2014) was conducted with 54 trials across nine states in the southern United States to evaluate plant injury from lepidopteran pests of corn and yield in a corn hybrid expressing Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Pioneer Brand Optimum Leptra) planted as a pure stand and in refuge blends of 5, 10, and 20% in both early and late plantings. Injury by corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was generally proportional to the percentage of non-Bt corn within each refuge blend. Across locations, ear injury in plots with 100% Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) corn ranged from no injury to a maximum of 0.42 cm(2) per ear in Mississippi in 2013. Leaf injury ratings in 100% non-Bt plots in early and late planted trials in 2014 were 86- and 70-fold greater than in 100% Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) plots. Plants in plots with blended refuges had significantly greater leaf injury in 2012 (5, 10, and 20% refuge blends), in the early-planted corn in 2013 (10 and 20% only), and in both early-and late-planted corn in 2014 (20% only) as compared with leaf injury in a pure stand of Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) seen during these years. Corn ears in plots with blended refuges also had significantly greater area of kernels injured in 2012 (5, 10, and 20%), in early-and late-planted corn in 2013 (5, 10, and 20%), and in early (10 and 20% only)and late-planted corn (5, 10, and 20%) in 2014 as compared with ear injury in a pure stand of Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra) seen during these years. Infestations of southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), were also significantly reduced by Cry1F x Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20 (Optimum Leptra). Despite these differences in injury, yield averaged across locations varied among refuge blends only in the late-planted trials in 2013, with greater yields in the 0% refuge blend than in the 20% blend; however, when examining yield separately by location, only two of nine locations had higher yields in the 100% Bt plots than in any of the blended refuge plots. As a complement to studying the contribution of blended refuge to delaying resistance, quantifying injury and yield in a range of refuge blends is a necessary step to provide management information on the range of lepidopteran pests that occur in the southern United States.

Larval detoxification abilities for plants of the Salicaceae and Magnoliaceae families are dramatically different and basically diagnostic as well. The distinguishing morphological traits of the adults and larvae have not been genetically characterized. Here we describe the segregation of diagnostic larval banding traits in offspring from the 2 species in their hybrid and reciprocal backcross combinations. Elucidation of genetic basis, and linkage relationships of a suite of distinguishing biochemical, physiological, morphological, and ecological traits with regard to their geographic concordance across the hybrid zone is fundamental to understanding the pattern and process of speciation.

Transgenic sweet corn expressing a synthetic cry gene for production of a Btk-insecticidal protein may provide a more environmentally acceptable means of sweet corn production. Eight transgenic sweet corn hybrids containing a synthetic gene for CryIA(b) protein production (BT11 event) were evaluated for resistance to the corn earworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith). Laboratory tests revealed that all Btk sweet corn hybrids were highly resistant to leaf and silk feeding by neonate 3 and 6 d old corn earworm larvae. Ear damage in the field to the Btk sweet corn hybrids caused by corn earworm was negligible. All Btk sweet corn hybrids, except Btk 95-0901, were moderately resistant to leaf and silk feeding by the fall armyworm. Survival and weight gain were reduced when neonates were fed excised whorl leaves of the Btk plants. Weight gain, but not survival, was reduced when 3- and 6-d-old fall armyworm larvae were fed excised whorl leaves of the Btk plants. Btk sweet corn hybrids appear to be ideal candidates for use in integrated pest management (IPM) programs for both the fresh and processing sweet corn markets, and their use should drastically reduce the quantity of insecticides currently used to control these pests in sweet corn. With appropriate cultural practices, it is highly unlikely that Btk sweet corn will contribute to the development of resistance to Btk proteins in these insects because of the high toxicity of the Cry proteins expressed in these sweet corn hybrids and the harvest of sweet corn ears from fields before larvae can complete development.

The hybrid males often flew to the pheromone of ECB Z-strain, but very rarely to the ACB pheromone. We mapped the tuning profiles of each ORN of the F(1) hybrids with respect to the relevant pheromone components and a common behavioral antagonist by employing differential cross-adaptation and varying doses of the ligands. In the trichoid sensilla of F(1) hybrid males, the three co-compartmentalized ORNs produced spikes that were very difficult to distinguish by size, unlike the parental populations. Comparing the responses to ACB and ECB components at different doses reveals overlapping profiles similar to males of both parental types, but more responsiveness to the ECB pheromone components. We were unable to detect any differences in the ORN tuning profiles when comparing males with different behavioral phenotypes. While the two ECB pheromone races have similar ORN tuning properties that are different from those in ACB, the spike-amplitude patterns of ECB E-strain and ACB have greater homology when compared to ECB Z-strain.

J	Emelianov, I; Marec, F; Mallet, J				Emelianov, I; Marec, F; Mallet, J			Genomic evidence for divergence with gene flow in host races of the larch budmoth	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						speciation; gene flow; selection; genomic analysis; larch budmoth	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; POLYMORPHISM; TORTRICIDAE; LEPIDOPTERA; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; INSECTS; ORIGIN; FEMALE	Ecological divergence in the face of gene flow has recently become implicated as a potentially important cause of speciation and adaptive radiation. Here, we develop a genomic approach to test for divergent selection in sympatric host races of the larch budmoth Zeiraphera diniana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). We analysed hundreds of amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in 92 individuals in sympatric and allopatric populations, and in two backcross broods used to map the markers to individual chromosomes. The results directly confirm the existence of natural hybridization and demonstrate strong heterogeneity between chromosomes in terms of molecular divergence between host races (the average level of divergence was F-ST = 0.216). However, genomic heterogeneity was not found when we analysed divergence between geographically separated populations of the same host race. We conclude that the variance of the level of sympatric divergence among chromosomes is the footprint of divergent selection acting on a few linkage groups, combined with appreciable gene flow that homogenizes between-race variation at the remaining linkage groups. These results, coupled with other recent multilocus analyses of sister species pairs, demonstrate that selection-driven sympatric phase of genetic divergence in the presence of gene flow is a likely feature of speciation.

In Hesperiidae the tribe Pyrrhopygini have a modal n = 28, Eudaminae and Pyrgini a modal n = 31, while Hesperiinae have n = around 29. Among Pieridae, Coliadinae have a strong modal n = 31 and among Pierinae Anthocharidini are almost fixed for n = 15 while Pierini vary with n = 26 as the most common chromosome number. Dismorphiinae show wide variation. We discuss these results in the context of chromosome numbers of over 1400 Neotropical butterfly species and subspecies derived from about 3000 populations published here and in earlier papers of a series. The overall results show that many Neotropical groups are characterized by karyotype instability with several derived modal numbers or none at all, while almost all taxa of Lepidoptera studied from the other parts of the world have one of n = 29-31 as modal numbers. Possibly chromosome number changes become fixed in the course of speciation driven by biotic interactions. Population subdivision and structuring facilitate karyotype change. Factors that stabilize chromosome numbers include hybridization among species sharing the same number, migration, sexual selection and possibly the distribution of chromosomes within the nucleus.

In addition to being species-poor, this family is predominantly nocturnal and has anti-bat ultrasound hearing organs. Evolutionary relationships among the 36 described species are largely unexplored. A new, target capture, anchored hybrid enrichment probe set ('BUTTERFLY2.0') was developed to infer relationships of hedylids and some of their butterfly relatives. The probe set includes 13 genes that have historically been used in butterfly phylogenetics. Our dataset comprised of up to 10,898 aligned base pairs from 22 hedylid species and 19 out-groups. Eleven of the thirteen loci were successfully captured from all samples, and the remaining loci were captured from >= 94% of samples. The inferred phylogeny was consistent with recent molecular studies by placing Hedylidae sister to Hesperiidae, and the tree had robust support for 80% of nodes. Our results are also consistent with morphological studies, with Macrosoma tipulata as the sister species to all remaining hedylids, followed by M. semiermis sister to the remaining species in the genus. We tested the hypothesis that nocturnally evolved once from diurnally in Hedylidae, and demonstrate that the ancestral condition was likely diurnal, with a shift to nocturnally early in the diversification of this family. The BUTTERFLY2.0 probe set includes standard butterfly phylogenetics markers, captures sequences from decades-old museum specimens, and is a cost-effective technique to infer phylogenetic relationships of the butterfly tree of life.

J	FROLOV, AN				FROLOV, AN			ANALYSIS OF THE TROPHIC RELATIONS OF EUROPEAN CORN-BORER AND BRUSHLEG STEM BORER (LEPIDOPTERA, PYRAUSTIDAE) ON A CORN FIELD, OVERGROWN WITH MUGWORT	SOVIET JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article								A study was conducted on the larval distribution of European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Hbn.) and brushleg borer O. scapulalis (Wlk.) on corn and mugwort in Charkassy Region. In the area of direct contact between host plants, at the edges of a corn field, overgrown with mugwort, our studies recorded an average 11.9% brushleg borer larvae on corn, and 8.1% corn borer larvae on mugwort over a four-year period. Outside these areas corn borer larvae were encountered exclusively on corn, and brushleg borer on mugwort. It transpires that feeding by brushleg borer larvae on corn at the field edge is not connected with the effects of hybridization with its close relative, the European corn borer, but may serve as a model of the prevailing conditions, when the corn borer initially altered its food preference to cereal crops.

For this reason, some specimens are not clearly identifiable. The yellow forms of males and the white forms of females are particularly problematic in terms of their identification. In this study, we investigated the reliability of external features for effective identification of this species pair using geometric morphometrics. The study specimens were tentatively identified to the species level based on genital characteristics and several genetic markers. Geometric morphometric analyses were focused on the variability of wings and male genital valvae of Slovak butterfly populations. The morphometric analysis of valvae enabled identification of most of the specimens, whereas based on the putatively diagnostic features of forewings and hindwings, several butterflies were incorrectly assigned to a species. Contrary to earlier observations, we observed that androconial scales are also present in some forms of C. erate.

Effects of Harvest Residue and Tillage on Lesser Cornstalk Borer (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) Damage to Sugarcane	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						sugarcane; lesser cornstalk borer; green cane; burnt cane; tillage	ELASMOPALPUS-LIGNOSELLUS ZELLER; MANAGEMENT STRATEGY; SOIL; TEMPERATURE; SYSTEM; MULCH; CANE	Lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an important pest of sugarcane (a complex hybrid of Saccharum spp.) in southern Florida. Cultural controls for E. lignosellus were evaluated in preparation for the potential loss of effective insecticides. Field studies conducted in 2006 compared the effects of harvest residues from green-harvested sugarcane (no preharvest burning to remove leaf matter) on E. lignosellus stalk damage and yield. Damage by E. lignosellus was significantly lower in plant cane plots that were covered with harvest residues collected from a green-harvested field before shoot emergence compared with plots without harvest residue. There were no yield differences between plots with and without harvest residues in plant or ratoon sugarcane fields in the 2006 study. The effects of three postharvest tillage levels (conventional, intermediate, and no tillage) were evaluated in preharvest burned and green-harvested fields in 2008 and 2009. Significantly less E. lignosellus damage was observed in the green- versus preharvest burned fields in both years. Intermediate and no-tillage plots had very little damage in green-harvested field. Conventional tillage plots had the greatest damage in the green-harvested field and the lowest damage in the preharvest burned field. In 2008, biomass yield was greater in the intermediate than conventional tillage in the green-harvested field, but it was greater in the conventional than in other tillage levels in the preharvest burned field. These studies demonstrated that cultural controls could greatly reduce E. lignosellus damage in sugarcane without the use of insecticides.

Susceptibility and yield response to sugarcane borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) infestation among sugarcanes and sorghums with potential for bioethanol production	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Diatraea saccharalis; Saccharum spp.; Biofuel; High biomass sorghum; Pest management	OVIPOSITION PREFERENCE; CONVENTIONAL SUGARCANE; SWEET SORGHUM; RICE; RESISTANCE; BIOENERGY; PYRALIDAE; EXPANSION; CULTIVARS; EFFICACY	The U.S. Gulf Coast has ideal conditions, including abundant rainfall and a long growing season, for production of dedicated bioenergy crops. Interest in producing bioethanol from high-biomass graminaceous crops including energycanes (Saccharum spp.) and energy sorghums (Sorghum spp. hybrids) in the region has increased. However, insect pests including the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), will likely adversely affect bioenergy crops. The impact of D. saccharalis infestations on yields of conventional and bioenergy sugarcanes and sorghums was investigated in three separate field studies conducted from 2012 to 2013. These studies compared D. saccharalis injury and crop yield parameters among insecticide-protected and unprotected plots of sugarcanes, energycanes, high biomass sorghums, and sweet sorghum. In unprotected plots, D. saccharalis injury ranged from 2.9 (resistant sugarcane) to 13.6% bored internodes (susceptible sugarcane). A resistant energycane cultivar was among the least injured (3.5% bored internodes) and demonstrated the greatest potential for bioethanol production with an average of > 17,000 L/ha. Linear regressions revealed negative relationships between percentage of bored internodes and ethanol yield in all cultivars. At one location, D. saccharalis injury resulted in a 13% reduction in bioethanol production across all years and cultivars. These studies indicate D. saccharalis has potential to substantially reduce yields in bioenergy crops and pest management programs will be needed to maximize ethanol production.	[Wilson, B.

Cross-hybridization was not observed between the M. sexta cDNAs and S. frugiperda DNA and mRNA. Vitellogenin cDNA from M. sexta did not hybridize to L. dispar DNA or mRNA. However, the 834 bp microvitellogenin cDNA from M. sexta hybridized to an approximately 850 bp transcript in L. dispar mRNA. A 2.5 kb cDNA clone, pz64, was isolated from late last instar larvae of female L. dispar by differential screening. This clone has 38% amino acid sequence (deduced) and 55% nucleic acid sequence similarities with the 3'-end of high molecular weight vitellogenin in Bombyx mori (silkworm). When used as a probe in northern analysis of L. dispar mRNA, this cDNA hybridized to a 5.3 kb transcript in female last instar larvae, pupae, and adults, but not to male last instar larvae and adults. This cDNA did not hybridize to mRNA from M. sexta or S. frugiperda. Expression of the 5.3 kb vitellogenin transcript hybridizing to the 2.5 kb cDNA clone was suppressed in 5-day-old last instar larvae of female L. dispar treated on day 2 with doses of the juvenile hormone analog, methoprene, greater than 10 nmol. Apparently, the high in vivo titer of juvenile hormone during the first 2 days of the last instar represses the transcription of vitellogenin mRNA. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

E. Smith) is one of the major pests of maize in Argentina. The main tool for its control is the use of genetically modified maize hybrids expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins. Maize growers in Argentina initially controlled this pest with Bt maize that expressed a single Bt protein (Cry1Ab or Cry1F). Currently it is necessary to plant maize cultivars that produce two Bt proteins to achieve the satisfactory control. Recently, Cry1F field-evolved resistant populations of this species were confirmed in Argentina. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of S. frugiperda field-collected strains on different Bt and non-Bt maize hybrids. Strains were collected from non-Bt maize (T1), Agrisure TDMax (T2), Agrisure Viptera (T3), Agrisure Viptera 3110 (T4), Genuity VT Triple Pro (T5), and Power Core (T6).Three experiments were performed to 1) determine the survivorship and reproduction of field-collected larvae (F-0) from Bt maize hybrids, 2) evaluate Cry1F resistance using an F-1 screen, and 3) assess the performance of F-1 strains on different maize hybrids. In the F-0, the survivorship from larva to adult ranged from 0 to 63%. We obtained adults from only the T1, T2, T5, and T6 strains with no significant differences in the reproductive parameters. Continuously rearing F-1 larvae on their collected hosts affected larval duration, which was significantly shorter for a known-laboratory Bt-susceptible strain than the field-collected strains. Our results support the existence of Cry1F-resistance alleles in S. frugiperda field populations in Argentina.

We test the hybrids-as sinks hypothesis in the Quercus grisea Liebm. X Quercus gambelii Nutt. hybrid complex. We measure densities of leaf-mining moths (Lepidoptera: Nepticulidae and Gracillariidae) and gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) on parental and hybrid host trees. We find no support for the hybrids-as-sinks hypothesis in the present hybrid complex. Hosts in this complex exhibited a unidirectional herbivore gradient, where hybrid hosts supported intermnediate levels of herbivores when compared to parental species.

J	Nealis, VG				Nealis, VG			Diapause and voltinism in western and 2-year-cycle spruce budworms (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae) and their hybrid progeny	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							CHORISTONEURA-FUMIFERANA LEPIDOPTERA; NORTH-AMERICA; GENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; SPECIES LEPIDOPTERA; LEDERER LEPIDOPTERA; OCCIDENTALIS; POPULATIONS; PSEUDOTSUGA; RETINIANA; BIENNIS	Breeding experiments and rearing under variable controlled conditions have revealed that western and 2-year-cycle spruce budworms (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman and C. biennis Freeman, respectively) from British Columbia, Canada, and their hybrid progeny have the inherent capacity for a variable number of diapause events and hence voltinism. While all crosses have at least one diapause, variability in the relative frequency of a second diapause is determined by genetic traits modified by the photoperiod and, to a lesser extent, temperature experienced during the larval stages. Second diapause appears fixed in C biennis but is facultative and most frequent at short photophases (121:12D) in C. occidentalis. Hybrids and backcrosses had responses intermediate to the parental responses under all environmental conditions. The occurrence of a facultative third diapause in all crosses underlines the inherent capacity for flexibility in voltinism in these species. These results are discussed in the context of past, present, and future distributions of alternative life cycles in closely related species.

Lessons from Heliconius butterflies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						speciation; reproductive barriers; hybrid sterility; mate choice; Lepidoptera; magic trait	SEXUAL SELECTION; MIMETIC BUTTERFLIES; MATE PREFERENCE; GENE FLOW; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; HYBRID STERILITY; WARNING-COLOR; CICHLID FISH; H.-MELPOMENE; MAGIC TRAITS	The process by which species evolve can be illuminated by investigating barriers that limit gene flow between taxa. Recent radiations, such as Heliconius butterflies, offer the opportunity to compare isolation between pairs of taxa at different stages of ecological, geographical, and phylogenetic divergence. Here, we report a comparative analysis of existing and novel data in order to quantify the strength and direction of isolating barriers within a well-studied clade of Heliconius. Our results highlight that increased divergence is associated with the accumulation of stronger and more numerous barriers to gene flow. Wing pattern is both under natural selection for Mullerian mimicry and involved in mate choice, and therefore underlies several isolating barriers. However, pairs which share a similar wing pattern also display strong reproductive isolation mediated by traits other than wing pattern. This suggests that, while wing pattern is a key factor for early stages of divergence, it may become facultative at later stages of divergence. Additional factors including habitat partitioning, hybrid sterility, and chemically mediated mate choice are associated with complete speciation. Therefore, although most previous work has emphasized the role of wing pattern, our comparative results highlight that speciation is a multi-dimensional process, whose completion is stabilized by many factors.

Life, history parameters of H. zea feeding on ears of conventional and Bt field corn varieties were measured in field plots in eastern North Carolina in 1997 and 1998. Transformation events investigated were Mon-810 and Bt-11. Bt corn was found to cause a steady mortality of larvae during development, but permitted approximate to 15-40% survival to the prepupal stage compared with non-Bt corn. Mortality of prepupae and pupae from Bt corn was also higher than from non-Bt com, reducing overall adult production by 65-95% The larvae that did survive grew more slowly on Bt than on non-Bt corn, and produced pupae that weighed 33% less. Pupation and adult eclosion were delayed by 6-10 d by feeding on Bt com ears. Com varieties, expressing Bt in ear tissue have the potential to reduce H. zea ear feeding by up to 80%, and the potential to reduce populations emerging from ear-stage corn fields to infest cotton, soybean and other crops by around 75%. To have a measurable effect on area-wide populations, Bt corn varieties would need to be planted in large proportions of corn fields, Extensive planting of varieties such as those tested here, having only moderate effects on H. zea, would raise concerns about rapid evolution of resistance.

This article documents survey results of its geographic distribution and host plant range in Guangxi and its morphological measurements, life cycle and behavior. In total, 83 Eucalyptus growing counties were surveyed. E. signifier was found in 59 counties. Host plants included 31 species in 16 families and 24 genera. Four Eucalyptus hybrid species were recorded as its host plant with E. grandis x E. urophylla and E. urophylla x E. grandis infested the heaviest. The infestation of Eucalyptus trees 1-2 yr old was heavier than that of older trees. Most individuals of E. signifier took 1 yr to complete a generation, overwintering as larvae in tunnels in wooden stems, and pupating in February of the following year. Adults emerge, mate, and lay eggs in April, and the eggs hatch in late April or early May. Adult emergence peaks between 17:00-18:59 hours. Mating flights last under 30 min at dusk and the copulation duration was 24 h. Moths were large, weighting and average of 3.4 g. Eggs and newly hatched larvae were very small, weighing only 0.127 +/- 0.001 mg and 0.093 +/- 0.017 mg, respectively. The larvae have two distinct development stages. One stage spends 1-2 mo living in the forest litter, the second stage then moves to woody stems where it feeds for approximate to 10 mo. Larvae start boring into hosts between June and November, mainly in July and August. This study indicated that E. signifier, a highly polyphagous native species, has shifted host to exotic Eucalyptus and can cause significant damage to plantations.

INHERITANCE OF ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO LEAF SAPS OF HOST- AND NONHOST PLANTS IN TWO Helicoverpa SPECIES AND THEIR HYBRIDS	ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						inheritance; Helicoverpa; sensilla styloconica; electrophysiological response; neurons	CONTACT CHEMORECEPTION; GUSTATORY SENSITIVITY; RECOGNITION CUE; LARVAE; LEPIDOPTERA; EVOLUTION; ARMIGERA; CATERPILLARS; HELIOTHINAE; SPECIALIST	The polyphagous cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) and the oligophagous oriental tobacco budworm Helicoverpa assulta (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) display contrasting heritable feeding preferences for cotton and pepper leaves. In this study, electrophysiological response patterns to cotton and pepper leaf saps in gustatory sensilla styloconica on the maxillae of these two species, their reciprocal F1 hybrids, and backcrossed lines were investigated using the tip recording technique. The identity of the neurons responding to the two leaf saps has been established using action potential waveform analysis. The two plant leaf saps elicited neural activity in at least six of the eight taste neurons innervating the lateral and medial sensilla styloconica of the parental species and crosses. Discriminant analysis of this multineural input predicted that correct classification occurred in 87 - 92% of the cases. Differences in taste neuron responses between insect lines to the two plant saps were consistent with differences in feeding preference behaviors. Comparisons of taste neuron response patterns of parental species, F1 hybrids and backcrosses indicate that autosomal loci contributed to the difference in gustatory response patterns between the two Helicoverpa species with the H. armigera derived alleles being partly dominant to those carried by H. assulta. These findings contribute to the understanding of gustatory codes for preference and provide insight into taste evolution of lepidopteran insects.

The western bean cutworm is an emerging or potential pest of transgenic Bt corn in South Dakota. The proportion of ears infested with western bean cutworm larvae in the Cry1Ab Bt corn hybrids were 18-20, 38-70, and 0-34% in 2000, 2003, and 2004, respectively. The Cry1Ab Bt corn hybrids were almost completely free of European corn borer infestations. Untreated conventional corn hybrids were less infested with western bean cutworm larvae but more infested with European corn borer larvae. The proportion of ears infested with European corn borer larvae alone were 33,58-80, and 8-25% in 2000,2003, and 2004, respectively. Infestations with western bean cutworm alone were 28, 8-28, and 13-19%, respectively. Proportion of ears simultaneously infested with both western bean cutworm and European corn borer larvae were much lower than single infestations by either species alone, indicating niche overlap and competition. Simultaneous infestations by the two species on untreated conventional corn hybrids were only 8,0-18, and 0-1% in 2000,2003, and 2004. The corn grains harvested from injured ears were also analyzed for fumonisin and aflatoxin through quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. More mycotoxins were found in 2003 when the levels of insect infestation in the corn ears were higher than in 2004. Results from this study underscore the need to investigate other emerging or potential arthropod pests of transgenic Bt corn hybrids in addition to the western bean cutworm.

The reduced efficacy against H. zea caterpillars of Bt plants expressing Cry toxins is increasing in the field. In a first step towards understanding Bt cotton-bollworm-microbiota interactions, we investigated the internal bacterial microbiota of second-third stadium H. zea collected in the field from non-Bt versus Bt (WideStrike) cotton in close proximity (in North Carolina, USA). The bacterial populations were analyzed using culture-dependent and -independent molecular approaches. We found that WideStrike samples had a higher bacterial density and diversity per larva than insects collected from non-Bt cotton over two field seasons: 8.42 +/- 0.23 and 5.36 +/- 0.75 (log(10) colony forming units per insect) for WideStrike compared to 6.82 +/- 0.20 and 4.30 +/- 0.56 for non-Bt cotton for seasons 1 and 2, respectively. Fifteen phyla, 103 families, and 229 genera were identified after performing Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA. At the family level, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae were the most abundant taxa. The Enterococcaceae family was comprised mostly of Enterococcus species (E. casseliflavus and another Enterococcus sp.). Members of the Enterococcus genus can acidify their environment and can potentially reduce the alkaline activation of some Bt toxins. These findings argue for more research to better understand the role of cotton-bollworm-bacteria interactions and the impact on Bt toxin caterpillar susceptibility.

CHARACTERIZATION OF F1 AND F2 HYBRID PROGENIES OF LYCOPERSICON-ESCULENTUM X LYCOPERSICON-PERUVIANUM AND SCREENING FOR VIRUS AND INSECT RESISTANCE	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GENETICA			English	Article								Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is one of the major limiting factors of tomato production in Brazil and other tropical areas during summer months. A good source of resistance to this virus and to insect pests has been identified among some Lycopersicon peruvianum individuals. Due to incompatibility and early embryo abortion, it has not been possible by conventional methods to obtain hybrids between these peruvianum sources and the commercial tomato (L esculentum). In a previous report, the recovery of several interspecific hybrid plants with embryo rescue techniques has been described (Segeren et al., 1993). In this paper, the characterization of the hybrid nature of such plants and their progenies, as well as the screening tests for TSWV and leaf miner, Scrobipalpuloides absoluta (Meyr.) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), resistance is reported. Seeds of F1 plants were variable in size and color; small green seeds had to be recultured again and were then able to develop directly into plants, without a callus phase. Large brown seeds were sown directly in soil. The large seeds gave rise to plants with more L esculentum characteristics, whereas plants from small seeds resembled the peruvianum phenotype. F2 and F3 plants varied in relation to leaf hairs, leaf shape and size, and fruit color and size. Hybrid fruits varied in color from green with stripes to yellow or orange at maturity, with a slightly larger size than those of L peruvianum. All F1 plants were self-incompatible. A few F2 and F3 plants obtained by sib crosses were self-compatible. Allelic segregation for the acid phosphatase (Aps 1) locus was detected among F2 and F3 individuals. Isozyme analysis of APS 1 demonstrated the presence of three phenotypes corresponding to genotypes 1/1, +/1 and +/+. Screening tests among F2 and F3 hybrid populations were performed under controlled conditions and showed segregation for resistance to TSWV and to tomato leaf miner. The recovery of interspecific hybrids through embryo culture was demonstrated to be an effective technique for overcoming crossing barriers within the genus Lycopersicon.

These strains can be distinguished by polymorphisms in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene. There is also a tandem-repeat genetic element called FR that is found in large sex-linked clusters primarily in the rice strain, as characterized by sampling of fall armyworm populations in the southeastern United States. It was recently shown that the FR element is also present in Brazil, where it exhibits a similar strain-biased distribution. In this article, the analysis of FR was extended to populations in southern Texas, one of the principle overwintering locations for fall armyworm that infests the continental United States. DNA sequence analysis and an optimized polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method demonstrated that FR sequences are present in Texas and show the same distribution pattern as observed in Florida. The distribution of FR in Florida has remained relatively unchanged over a 4-yr period, suggestive of polymorphic equilibrium and the existence of at least partial barriers to the generation of interstrain hybrids. The implications of these findings on our understanding of interstrain mating behavior and the utility of the modified detection method to study fall armyworm populations are discussed.

This nematode was obtained by the insect-baiting technique using last instar larvae of Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). This new species is described herein as S. tielingense n. sp. It belongs to the 'feltiae-kraussei-oregonense' group and is characterised by infective third-stage juvenile (IJ) with a body length of 915 (824-979) mu m, distance from head to excretory pore of 69 (64-73) mu m, tail length of 81 (74-85) mu m, ratio E = 88 (85-94)%, lateral field with eight ridges at mid-body, first generation male spicule 88 (79-98) mu m and gubernaculum 61 (49-70) mu m long, and first generation female with a vulval protrusion and ratio D = 41 (32-49)%. The new species distinctly differs from the related species S. kraussei, S. silvaticum, S. oregonense and S. cholashanense in the different number of ridges in the lateral fields and hyaline tail length as % of total tail length of 11 and male body length and distance from head to excretory pore. Cross hybridisation tests showed that these species were reproductively isolated. The sequences analyses of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and D2-D3 regions of the ribosomal DNA confirm this to be a new species.

More than 70 MacoNPV REN fragments were cloned into plasmids pUC18 and pBluescript SK(+), The physical map with 112 restriction sites for the above REN was constructed using double digests and Southern blot hybridization analysis of the MacoNPV DNA clones, The size of the DNA genome of the MacoNPV-90/2 isolate used for this study was estimated at 156 kbp based on REN fragment sizes, The position of the polyhedrin gene, which has by convention been used as the zero point of the REN maps of NPV, was determined by hybridizing the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus HindIII-V fragment clone, which contains most of the polyhedrin gene, with genomic blots of MacoNPV, The cloned MacoNPV fragments identified as containing the polyhedrin gene were sequenced and an ORF coding for a 246 amino acid polypeptide with 98.7% sequence identity with Panolis flammea nucleopolyhedrovirus (PaflNPV) polyhedrin protein was identified, The putative polyhedrin gene sequence had 97.2% and 91.2% identity with the PaflNPV and Mamestra brassicae multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus polyhedrin gene sequences, respectively, and also contained an upstream region identical to the highly conserved 12 bp consensus sequence TGTAAGT-AATTT typical of NPV very late genes.

It also can be applied to sexuals allowing the study of phylogenetic relationships in species complexes consisting of sexuals and asexuals of different ploidy levels. The measure groups genotypes into classes dependent on homozygosity vs heterozygosity and the number of ancestral allele types vs the number of presumed new mutations. Its value is related to evolutionary time since divergence. The application of the method is illustrated by using electrophoretic data on the species group Solenobia triquetrella (Lepidoptera: Psychidae). A high similarity of estimated relationships among the proposed as well as other genetic identity measures is shown in the case of diploid sexual and asexual races of this species group. The phylogenetic relationships within the group are reanalyzed and monophyletic vs polyphyletic origin of parthenogenesis in this species complex is discussed. The genetic identity values found by the proposed procedure are explained by a polyphyletic origin of parthenogenesis, though a monophyletic origin of parthenogenesis in a broader sense cannot be excluded. The explanation of the phylogenetic relationships is based on the assumption of hybridization between related species and the extinction of one ancestral species. Furthermore, the genetic diversity is compared among sexual and parthenogenetic races of the species.

J	Zhou, XJ; Nguyen, T; Kimbrell, DA				Zhou, XJ; Nguyen, T; Kimbrell, DA			Identification and characterization of the Cecropin antibacterial protein gene locus in Drosophila virilis	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION			English	Article						cecropin; antibacterial protein genes; Drosophila virilis; insect immunity; gene duplication	ACUTE-PHASE RESPONSE; INSECT IMMUNITY; INNATE IMMUNITY; MELANOGASTER; EXPRESSION; EVOLUTION; PEPTIDES; DNA; SEQUENCES; MICROPIA	Cecropin is a type of antibacterial peptide that is synthesized in response to infection and has been characterized in many insect species and one mammal. The Cecropin locus of Drosophila melanogaster also contains the gene Andropin, which has been identified only in this species and encodes a male-specific antibacterial peptide. As a first step in studying the molecular evolution of the cecropin and andropin genes among Drosophila species, we have isolated genomic clones that cover the Cecropin locus in Drosophila virilis. The cloned region totals approximately 25 kb, within which a 9-kb fragment contains four cecropin genes and one pseudogene. All four genes have a high level of sequence homology to D. melanogaster Cecropin, about 80% identity in the coding regions, and the intron positions are conserved. As in D. melanogaster and other insects, KB-related cis-regulatory elements are found upstream of these cecropin genes. An Andropin-related sequence was not identified in D. virilis; however, genome Southern hybridizations suggest that Andropin-related sequences are present in at least the melanogaster species subgroup. Analysis of 19 insect cecropin genes identifies a common ancestral Cecropin before the divergence of Diptera and Lepidoptera. In addition, D. melanogaster and D. virilis can be identified by monophyletic clades for Cecropin. In contrast, the Lepidopteran species show polyphyletic relationships for duplicated cecropin genes.

In this study, prezygotic and postzygotic isolation were evaluated in parental and F1 generations collected from Solanum lycopersicum (S. 1), S. quitoense (S. q) and S. betaceum (S. b), representing medium size (S. 1, S. q) and large size genitalia races (S. b). 617 adults were obtained in the laboratory and 106 copulated. One spermatophore per female was found in the bursa copulatrix, suggesting monoandry. Crosses between adults mostly occurred assortatively. A third of the female's eggs laid occurred, but females from female S. b x male S. 1, female S. 1 x male S. b and S. 1 x S. 1 did not. In the cross, female S. 1 x male S. q and its reciprocal F-1 progeny developed into larvae. Reproductive success only occurred in three crosses: S. q x S. q, female S. q x male S. b and its reciprocal progeny. All the progeny from these crosses reached adulthood. The parental population showed differences in pupae and adult measurements according to host. The results on reproductive isolation obtained here suggest speciation in N. elegantalis due to host race differentiation which is relevant for the improvement of the management of this species, especially when the species has evolved reproductive isolation among races. We suggest that the use of their host plants in sympatry might reduce N. elegantalis densities in the field since hybrids between its races have low survival rates and to evaluate the possibility of pheromone composition differentiation among races given the results on assortative mating obtained here.

Canola Nutrition and Variety Affect Oviposition and Offspring Performance in the Generalist Herbivore, Mamestra configurata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Noctuidae; insect-plant interaction; fertilizer	PLUTELLA-XYLOSTELLA LEPIDOPTERA; BERTHA ARMYWORM; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; WALKER LEPIDOPTERA; BRASSICA-NAPUS; HOST-PLANT; LARVAL PERFORMANCE; GRAPEVINE MOTH; RESISTANCE; GROWTH	Bertha armyworm Mamestra configurata Walker (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a generalist herbivore that feeds on several crops in different plant families. Canola Brassica napus L. (Capparales: Brassicaceae) is one of the most favored host plants making the bertha armyworm a significant insect pest in the Canadian Prairie Provinces. The performance of the bertha armyworm on canola may vary with the quality of the canola plant. We tested the impact of plant nutrition and canola variety on oviposition and subsequent larval development of the bertha armyworm. A range of fertilization levels (0.0,1.0,3.0, and 5.0 g/pot) were applied to three different canola varieties: Clearfield 5535 CL, Roundup Ready hybrid 6060RR, and Q2. The total number of eggs laid on plants in a no-choice experiment increased with fertilizer level but a similar number of eggs were laid on plants that received moderate and high fertilizer treatments. Larvae reared on plants that received the moderate fertilizer application yielded heavier pupae than those reared on plants with low and high fertilizer treatments. Most eggs were laid on the Q2 variety when compared to Clearfield 5535 CL and Roundup Ready 6060 RR. Bertha armyworm females preferred to lay eggs on plants that received moderate or high fertilization over plants with the low fertilizer treatment. Plant leaf tissue nutrient content and plant growth were highest in plants that received moderate and high fertilizer treatment. We conclude that bertha armyworm oviposition behavior and larval performance are influenced by fertilizer treatment and canola variety.

L., native to the western United States. Following the range expansion into the U.S. Corn Belt, pheromone trap monitoring began in the Great Lakes region in 2006.The first S. albicosta was captured in Michigan in 2006 and in Ontario, Canada in 2008. Pheromone traps were used to document spread and increasing captures of S. albicosta across Michigan and Ontario until 2012. Trapping confirmed the univoltine life cycle of S. albicosta in this region and identified peak flight, typically occurring in late July. Overwintering of S. albicosta in this region was confirmed by emergence from infested fields and overwintering experiments. Multiple soil textures were infested with prepupae, and recovery was assessed throughout the winter. Overwintering success was not affected by soil texture, however, prepupae were found at greater depths in coarse-textured soils Soil temperatures at overwintering depths did not reach the supercooling point Injury to corn by S. albicosta increased in incidence, severity and geographic range from 2010 to 2014 in field plots. Decreasing control of injury by Cry 1F corn hybrids was observed over time.These findings show that S. albicosta has established as a perennial corn pest in the Great Lakes region due to observations of overwintering success and unmanaged injury. We recommend S. albicosta obtain primary pest status in this region within regulatory framework and a resistance management plan be required for traits targeting this pest.	[Smith, J.

In one bioassay, larvae were fed fresh excised whorl leaf tissue and in the other, they were fed reconstituted diets containing ground lyophilized leaf tissue from three phenotypic leaf regions of both hybrids. Results of the two bioassays were similar. Differences in larval weights were found for those larvae fed tissue from leaf regions within and across hybrids. The largest differences among treatments were found within the resistant hybrid, thus showing that regions of the same whorl leaf differ in suitability of food source for larval growth.

Significant differences in larval performance were found between clones and within the same clone at different phenological states. No larvae were able to complete development on clone NM6. All gypsy moth larvae feeding on clone NC5271 survived when leaf flush was synchronized with gypsy moth eclosion in early May. However, neonates feeding on NC5271 foliage in July experienced increased mortality. Weights of surviving gypsy moth larvae feeding on NC5271 foliage in May versus July were not significantly different.

In the present study, the relation of leaf biochemical characters with the infestation of citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on six citrus cultivars; Meyer Lime (lemon x mandarin hybrid), Kinnow, and Feutrell's Early (Citrus mandarins), Fairchild (C. tangerines), Succari and Musambi (C. sinensis) was determined. It was also hypothesized that the CLM damage increases from lower to upper canopy of the plant. The highest level of infestation was observed on the upper canopy of citrus plants, followed by a middle and lower canopy in the case of all citrus cultivars. The CLM damage also varied between six citrus cultivars with the highest level of 24.24% for Meyer Lime and 21.42% for Kinnow cultivars and the least affected cultivar by CLM feeding was Musambi with 9.31% infestation. Among the leaf traits, nitrogen and moisture contents showed significant and positive relation with CLM infestation in all citrus cultivars. Total minerals in leaves didn't show the significant (P > 0.05) relation with CLM damage in all citrus cultivars. Crude proteins showed significant relation with CLM only in the case of the Meyer Lime cultivar. Our findings suggest that the moisture level and nitrogen contents in the leaves are important factors for enhancing the activity of CLM and this interaction can impact the growth and productivity of citrus plants.

Seasonal variation in food consumption, assimilation, and conversion efficiency of Indian bivoltine hybrid silkworm, Bombyx mori	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						ingesta; digesta; nutritional efficiency parameters; bivoltine silkworm	GROWTH	Food consumption and utilization is influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors. Under different environmental, feeding, and nutritional conditions, and with ingestion of the same amount of mulberry leaves, the silkworm shows significant difference in its ability to digest, absorb, and convert food to body matter. Here, influences of season, temperature, and humidity on food intake, assimilation, and conversion efficiency of the Indian bivoltine hybrid (CSR2 x CSR4) Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) were studied. The results indicated that food ingestion and assimilation were significantly higher among silkworm batches where optimum temperature and humidity were maintained compared with silkworm batches exposed to natural climatic conditions of the respective season. However, during summer the nutritional efficiency parameters were significantly higher among silkworms reared under natural temperature and humidity conditions when compared with the control. During the winter and rainy season, the nutritional efficiency parameters were significantly higher in control batches, where optimum temperature and humidity were maintained. Ingesta and digesta required to produce one gram of cocoon/shell were also lower in control batches for all seasons except summer. This may be due to the physiological adaptation of silkworms to overcome stress during the summer season.	[Rahmathulla, V. K.; Suresh, H.

E. Smith), and the southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella (Dyar), can cause economic damage to maize, Zea mays L., grown in the southeastern United States. Maize hybrids are commercially available that have been transformed to express insecticidal crystalline proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner. The field efficacy of seven Bt hybrids were tested for control of leaf-feeding fall armyworm and southwestern corn borer. All Bt hybrids performed better than their conventional near-isolines for control of both insects. In general, the Bt hybrids provided intermediate resistance to the fall armyworm and near immunity to the southwestern corn borer. Based on larval establishment and weights, the fall armyworm was more tolerant of the insecticidal proteins expressed by the Bt hybrids than the southwestern corn borer. There was no difference in expression of insecticidal proteins among the Bt hybrids. Bt hybrids should be advantageous for the production of maize in areas that are affected by southwestern corn borer. The moderate level of resistance in the Bt hybrids to fall armyworm should be further examined to determine if amplifying the expression of insecticidal proteins or integrating other control methods along with the use of current Bt hybrid maize is needed to protect the crop from yield reduction by this pest.

Host resistance and influence of tuber surface on larval performance of potato tuberworm (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)	JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE			English	Article						Phthorimaea operculella; Plant resistance; Tuber periderm; Potato tuberworm; Solanum berthaultii	PHTHORIMAEA-OPERCULELLA LEPIDOPTERA; SOLANUM-BERTHAULTII; ZELLER LEPIDOPTERA; MOTH; OVIPOSITION	Potato tuberworm (PTW), Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is one of the most important pests of potatoes in tropic and subtropic regions. Previous studies suggested that tuber periderm may limit larval penetration and establishment of PTW. Short term influence of parental host plant acclimatization, influence of tuber dormancy and influence of tuber periderm (the outer cork layer of tubers) on aspects of PTW biology were investigated on tubers of a susceptible commercial potato cultivar, cv. Allegany (Solanum tuberosum L.), and a resistant hybrid potato clone, Q174-2 (S. tuberosum x S. berthaultii Hawkes). Short-term parental host plant acclimatization did not affect numbers of PTW larvae on resistant and susceptible tubers. Numbers of larvae produced on tubers of Q174-2, and Allegany, were similar although larval weight was less on Q174-2 than on Allegany. Larval production increased with tuber age on both susceptible and resistant potato clones, suggesting that bud sprouts may enhance fitness by providing food and shelter for first instars prior to tuber entry. Removal of tuber periderm led to a significant increase in larval survival on Allegany and Q174-2, although proportional survival on Allegany and Q174-2 was similar to that on intact tubers, suggesting the involvement of internal rather than external periderm factors in tuber resistance of Q174-2. Weights of larvae reared on Q174-2 were consistently less than those of larvae reared on susceptible potato tubers in both intact and peeled tuber assays. Although the expression of periderm-mediated tuber resistance declines with tuber age, such resistance could significantly reduce preharvest field infestations by PTW and constitute an important component of sustainable PTW management, particularly for fresh market crops and for those potato crops stored for several months or less in the absence of refrigeration.

Yield Losses in Transgenic Cry1Ab and Non-Bt Corn as Assessed Using a Crop-Life-Table Approach	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						maize; Bt toxin; corn earworm; fall armyworm; silk fly; natural enemy	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA; BORER LEPIDOPTERA; DORU-LUTEIPES; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; ARANEAE THERIDIIDAE; TERM ASSESSMENT; MAIZE PLANTS; KEY FACTORS	In this study, we constructed crop life tables for Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) Cry1Ab and non-Bt corn hybrids, in which yield-loss factors and abundance of predaceous arthropods were recorded during 2 yr at two locations. Corn kernel/grain was the yield component that had the heaviest losses and that determined the overall yield loss in the corn hybrids across years and locations. Yield losses in both corn hybrids were primarily caused by kernel-destroying insects. Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were the key loss factors at one location, while at the other, the key loss factor was the silk fly larvae, Euxesta spp. (Diptera: Ulidiidae). Although the realized yield of corn grains was not different (P > 0.05) between Cry1Ab and non-Bt corn hybrids, the Bt corn hybrid reduced (P < 0.05) the damage by H. zea and S. frugiperda in three of the four field trials, particularly at the location where Lepidoptera were the key loss factors. As expected, no reduction in the abundance of predaceous arthropods was observed in Cry1Ab corn fields. Various species of natural enemies were recorded, particularly the earwig Doru luteipes (Scudder) (Dermaptera: Forficulidae), which was the most abundant and frequent predaceous insect. These results indicate that integration of pest management practices should be pursued to effectively minimize losses by kernel-destroying insects during corn reproductive stages when growing non-Bt or certain low-dose Bt corn cultivars for fall armyworm and corn earworm, such as those producing Cry1Ab or other Cry toxins.

The Spread of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Coexistence with Helicoverpa zea in Southeastern Brazil	INSECTS			English	Article							RECORD	Helicoverpa armigera, one of the world's most destructive crop pests, was first documented in Brazil in 2013. Within a few months, this polyphagous insect had spread over the Northeast and Central-West of Brazil, causing great agricultural losses. With several reports of populations resistant to pesticides and Bt crops around the world, there is great concern about the spread of this pest in Brazil. There is confusion about the actual distribution of this species due to the high morphological similarity with the native corn earworm Helicoverpa zea, which may also coexist with H. armigera in the field. Our aims here were (i) to confirm its presence in the State of Minas Gerais, one of the most important agricultural regions in the country; and (ii) to assess the co-occurrence of this pest with the congeneric corn earworm H. zea. Using molecular screening, we confirmed the presence of H. armigera in Bt-crops of soybean and cotton, and non-Bt-crops of soybean, cotton and maize. Mixed infestations of H. armigera with H. zea were found in non-Bt maize (Vicosa, Southeastern Minas Gerais). These results highlight the need for adequate control strategies for H. armigera in Brazil, to deal with its polyphagous feeding habits, high dispersal capacity and possible risks of hybridization with congeneric species.

Dispersal of newly eclosed European corn borer adults (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) from corn into small-grain aggregation plots	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						european corn borer; dispersal; Bt; transgenic corn	OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS LEPIDOPTERA; TRANSGENIC MAIZE; SEXUAL-ACTIVITY; PYRALIDAE; RESISTANCE; MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; FLIGHT; SITES	Genetically modified, insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn, Zea mays L., hybrids are used throughout the Corn Belt for European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), control. To slow development of Bt corn resistance, the Environmental Protection Agency requires growers to plant a refuge. Determining the appropriate distance between a refuge and Bt corn, and development of mitigation-remediation strategies such as mass releases of susceptible moths, requires an understanding of adult dispersal and mating behavior. However, much remains unknown about these behaviors. Because mating often occurs in grass near cornfields where adult O. nubilalis aggregate, we planted small-grain plots as aggregation sites in an attempt to retain mass-released adults. The objectives of this study were to examine influences of pheromone lure, plant density, and plant species on distributions of feral and newly emerged, laboratory-reared O. nubilalis among small-grain aggregation plots. Feral adults were collected in aggregation plots in relative abundance, indicating that small-grain plots were acceptable aggregation sites. In contrast, newly emerged adults that were released weekly as dye-marked pupae were rarely found in aggregation plots, with approximate to 150 -1,500-fold fewer adults captured than expected if all released adults had occupied the plots for >= 1 d. The majority of newly emerged adults did not colonize the aggregation plots, suggesting that recently eclosed adults leave their natal field and do not colonize the first aggregation sites encountered. Plant species significantly influenced adult distributions among aggregation plots. Mass releases of laboratory-reared pupae in the field may not be a viable remediation tactic because almost all of the newly emerged adults dispersed beyond 300 m of the release point.

M., J. Insect Physiol. 43(9) (1997) 855-874]. In this paper, the effects of dietary STI on a related family of midgut serine proteinases, the chymotrypsins, were investigated. STI-insensitive midgut chymotrypsins were detected in larvae of H. tea and A. ipsilon feeding on diets containing 1% STI while STI-sensitive chymotrypsins were present in larvae feeding on diets containing 0% STI. These chymotrypsins were unaffected by TPCK, a diagnostic inhibitor of mammalian chymotrypsins but were fully inhibited by chymostatin, Four midgut cDNA libraries were constructed from larvae of each species fed either 0% STI or 1% STI diets. Six full-length cDNAs(1) encoding diverse preprochymotrypsins were isolated (three from H. zea and three from A. ipsilon) with certain sequence motifs that set them apart from their mammalian counterparts. Northern blots showed that some chymotrypsin mRNA were detected at higher levels while others were down-regulated when comparing insects reared on 0% STI and Ilo STI diets. Southern hybridizations suggested that (like mammals) both species contained several chymotrypsin genes. A full-length chymotrypsin gene(1) from H. tea was sequenced for the first time and the presence of four introns was deduced. A first time comparison of 5' upstream regions(1) from three chymotrypsin genes and two trypsin genes of A. ipsilon indicated the presence of putative TATA boxes and regulatory elements. However a lack of consensus motifs in these upstream regions suggested the likelihood of multiple trans factors for regulation of genes encoding digestive proteinases and a complex response mechanism linked to ingestion of proteinase inhibitors.

We obtained cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences for 134 morphologically identified specimens, representing 12 species of Rhamma from Colombia. Ten of these species have not been previously barcoded. DNA barcodes suggested the potential for eight additional cryptic species in Colombia but we were readily able to morphologically diagnose just one of these linages as a new species which recently was described in a separate paper as Rhamma dawkinsi Prieto & Lorenc-Brudecka, 2017. The morphological species were separated into three categories: species showing a perfect match between morphological species and BINs (33%, four species); species sharing a BIN completely or partly (single specimens) with another morphological species (42%, five species placed in three BINs); and morphological species splitting up into more than one BIN (25%, three species placed in 10 BINs). The high percentages of incongruence between morphology-based identification and species delineation through BINs, could be explained as a consequence of high rates of introgressive hybridization. However, DNA barcodes can be considered diagnostic even in cases where specimens of a species were assigned to two or more distinct BINs and in species showing a low but constant divergence causing their assignment to a single BIN, which is often the case in young, allopatric species. We retain 10 of the 12 species (83%) to be diagnostic in molecular identification.

Effect of age and mating status on adult European corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) dispersal from small-grain aggregation plots	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						european corn borer; Ostrinia nubilalis; dispersal; Bt; transgenic corn	OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS LEPIDOPTERA; RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT; INSECT RESISTANCE; SEXUAL-ACTIVITY; EGG MASSES; PYRALIDAE; EVOLUTION; FLIGHT; SITES; CROPS	The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is often controlled with genetically modified corn, Zea mays L., hybrids (Bacillus thuringiensis [Bt] corn) in the United States. If Bt-resistant insects are detected in the field, mitigation-remediation tactics must be implemented to sustain the efficacy of insecticidal, transgenic corn. Mass releasing laboratory-reared, susceptible adults near aggregation sites to mate with locally emerging resistant adults is a possible remediation tactic, but it is imperative that the former remain in or near the release site long enough to mate. Understanding adult dispersal behavior relative to the timing of mating is important, because it directly affects patterns of gene flow and the rate at which Bt resistance moves through a population. Previous work shows that newly eclosed adults do not remain in proximity to their natal field. However, moth age, reproductive development, or mating status may influence the propensity to disperse. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of adult age (0-3, 4-6, and 7-10 d old) and mating status on dispersal of adults released in small-grain aggregation plots. Less than 1% of the marked adults released in the aggregation plots remained after one night. More males than females were recovered. Age influenced dispersal, with mostly 4-6-d old adults being recovered. Conversely, mating status did not affect the number of adults recovered. Given the paucity of marked adult moths recovered near their release sites, mass releases of adults may not be a viable tactic to combat the spread of resistance to Bt corn.

E. Smith), has been released. Resistant genotypes sustain less leaf-feeding damage than susceptible genotypes. Larvae that feed on plants of resistant genotypes or on tissue collected from these plants grow more slowly than those that feed on susceptible genotypes. Both resistant and susceptible genotypes sustain less damage as the plants mature. This investigation was undertaken to determine the associations between various chemical and physical characteristics of resistant and susceptible corn hybrids and leaf-feeding damage and larval growth on hybrids infested at different vegetative stages of growth. Leaf feeding was heavier on plants infested 28-35 d after planting than older plants. Larvae from the held weighed more when plants were infested between 28 and 35 d. Larvae fed on lyophilized leaf tissue in laboratory bioassays were heaviest when whorl tissue was collected from plants 28-35 d after planting. Larvae fed on tissue of resistant hybrids weighed less than those fed on tissue of susceptible hybrids. Resistant hybrids completed the transition from juvenile to adult earlier than susceptible hybrids. The 7th leaf was the Ist adult leaf of the resistant hybrids, but the 10th or 11th was the Ist adult leaf of susceptible hybrids. Leaves of susceptible hybrids were less tough than leaves of resistant hybrids, and toughness increased with plant age. Relative amounts of hemicellulose were higher in resistant genotypes and in order plants of all genotypes. Hemicellulose and protein levels appear to be associated with fall armyworm resistance, but not southwestern corn borer resistance. Relative amounts of cellulose were negatively correlated with leaf feeding by both insects. Relative amounts of ash, fat, and lignin did not appear to be associated with resistance. Further investigations of resistant and susceptible genotypes at different vegetative stages of growth should be useful in identifying factors associated with resistance to fall armyworm and southwestern corn borer.

Susceptibility of the crop to foliage feeders like Achaea janata (semilooper) and Spodoptera litura accounts for 30-50% of yield losses. Owing to a lack of reliable sources of resistance to these lepidopteran pests, attempts were made to develop transgenic events expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cry1Aa gene. Transformation of decotyledonated embryo axes through Agrobacterium tumefaciens, particle gun bombardment and in planta methods resulted in transformation frequencies of 2.4%, 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively. The presence and integration of the cry1Aa gene in the TO plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern hybridization analysis. Based on segregation for a Mendelian ratio of 3:1, eight events (AMT-894, AMT-899, AK1304-PB-1, AK1304-PB-4, AK1304-PB-785, AK1304-PB-830, AK1304-PB-837 and DTS-43) were advanced. ELISA analysis detected protein from 0.16 to 2.76 ng/mg fresh leaf tissue across events and in different generations. In laboratory insect bioassays, the mortality of S. litura and A. janata ranged from 20 to 80% in different transgenic events and the weight reduction of surviving larvae over the control larvae after 8 days of feeding was 28.4-87.2% in the case of S. litura and 27.9-78.1% for A. janata. In field bioassays, the event AMT-894 was most promising with 43% of plants showing less than 25% leaf damage. As part of the regulatory requirement to check the toxicity of the transgenic events to beneficial insects, larval bioassays against Samia cynthia ricini (eri silkworm) using three transgenic events (AK1304-PB-1, AK1304-PB-4 and AMT-894) showed a 20.2-78.5% reduction in weight.

The Reliability of Genitalia Morphology to Monitor the Spread of the Invasive Winter Moth (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in Eastern North America	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						forest pest; biological control; microsatellite; morphology	OPEROPHTERA-BRUMATA LEPIDOPTERA; NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; BRUCEATA HULST LEPIDOPTERA; PHEROMONE-BAITED TRAPS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; SPANWORM; HYBRIDIZATION; INFERENCE; EUROPE; TOOL	Winter moth, Operophtera brumata L. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), causes widespread defoliation in both its native and introduced distributions. Invasive populations of winter moth are currently established in the United States and Canada, and pheromone-baited traps have been widely used to track its spread. Unfortunately, a native species, the Bruce spanworm, O. bruceata (Hulst), and O. bruceata x brumata hybrids respond to the same pheromone, complicating efforts to detect novel winter moth populations. Previously, differences in measurements of a part of the male genitalia called the uncus have been utilized to differentiate the species; however, the accuracy of these measurements has not been quantified using independent data.To establish morphological cutoffs and estimate the accuracy of uncus-based identifications, we compared morphological measurements and molecular identifications based on microsatellite genotyping. We find that there are significant differences in some uncus measurements, and that in general, uncus measurements have low type I error rates (i.e., the probability of having false positives for the presence of winter moth). However, uncus measurements had high type II error rates (i.e., the probability of having false negatives for the presence of winter moth). Our results show that uncus measurements can be useful for performing preliminary identifications to monitor the spread of winter moth, though for accurate monitoring, molecular methods are still required. As such, efforts to study the spread of winter moth into interior portions of North America should utilize a combination of pheromone trapping and uncus measurements, while maintaining vouchers for molecular identification.

Pupal diapause is induced by rearing the larvae under short day lengths. We previously demonstrated that feeding Dopa during last larval instar induces pupal diapause even under long day lengths. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which pupal diapause is induced after experiencing short day lengths or fed Dopa under long day lengths, we analyzed gene expression in the brain of M brassicae larvae under both of these conditions using a subtractive hybridization technique. After the secondary screen, 49 clones and 28 clones were identified as short day length or Dopa-feeding specific clones, respectively. All of these genes were sequenced and, using the base sequences of these clones, primers were synthesized. To confirm the genes enhanced specifically by these conditions, quantitative real-time PCR was carried out. This quantitative PCR analysis identified 15 and I clone whose expression was enhanced by the short day length conditions or Dopa-feeding, respectively. Among these clones, the gene with a high level of identity to receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK) from Heliothis virescens is the most dramatically up-regulated under both conditions.

Knowledge of species diversification, population structure, and host preference can aid efforts to manage pest populations. Here, we investigated the patterns of hybridization, genetic structure, and gene flow in S. frugiperda populations, discussing how we can apply this knowledge to insect resistance management programs in South America. Results The corn-strain CS-h2 of S. frugiperda was the most frequent haplotype in all sampled populations. Spodoptera frugiperda populations are experiencing demographic expansion, and the ecoregions partially explain the genetic structure and not strains. We did not find a correlation between gene flow and susceptibility levels to flubendiamide and lufenuron insecticides, but populations with high LC50 sent a great number of migrants to all other locations, maintaining resistance alleles in the geographic range. Conclusion High levels of population admixture, including between corn- and rice-strains, were found in sampled populations. We showed that S. frugiperda immigrants will not necessarily cause an increase in LC50 upon arrival in a new location but will assure the constant presence of resistance alleles in the area. Increases in LC50 largely depend on the local pesticide management adopted in the areas. Our results indicate that pesticide resistance management must be adopted on a local or small regional scale.

A bimodal pattern of attraction was evident at all 3 sites. One peak of attraction was in early to midafternoon, with a 2nd, usually smaller peak, following sunset. Temperature modulated attraction: warm daytime temperatures increased catch, whereas low nighttime temperatures generally suppressed or eliminated attraction. However, the surge of male attraction to pheromone in the hour after sunset seemed unaffected by falling temperatures. As average temperatures at the 3 sites decreased, the daytime peak of male activity progressively shifted to later in the afternoon. Female eclosion in Germany also followed a bimodal pattern, with a major midmorning to midday peak of emergence and a 2nd, smaller peak, in the afternoon. The timing of male attraction allowed coordination of the ranging flight of the male with the availability of emerging and pheromone-emitting females. The congruence in daily activity patterns suggest that the timing of mating would not be a barrier to the hybridization of the Asian, European, and North American strains of this lymantriid in new areas of sympatry.

To clarify whether there is any risk from pollen of Cry1Ab-containing corn varieties on this insect, the frequency of pollen dispersal and deposition of corn pollen near cornfields and impact on the development of tussah silkworm larvae were studied separately in the field and laboratory. The field survey showed that the pollen density was the highest inside the cornfield with a value of approximate to 1,000 grains/cm(2). The pollen deposition rapidly declined with distance from the edge of the cornfield as expected in most cases. No significant differences were observed in the amounts of pollen deposited on glass slides positioned at different heights from the ground at each distance. In the laboratory bioassays, there were no significant differences in the larval mortality and weight of Chinese tussah silkworm between treatment with pollen grains from a transgenic corn line and a nontransgenic corn control at a density of 1,000 pollen grains/cm(2). Also no significant negative impact was found for efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), and efficiency of approximate digestion of food (AD) at the level of 1,000 pollen grains/cm(2). The results of this study suggest that the impact on the Chinese tussah silkworm of Bt corn pollen from the hybrid to be commercialized in China is negligible in the natural environment.

It exhibits two biotypes (corn and rice) that are almost identical morphologically, but differ in their genetic composition and resistance to insecticides and Bacillus thuringiensis, with the corn biotype more resistant than the rice biotype. This work is the first molecular identification in Colombia of these biotypes for larvae collected from corn, rice and cotton crops in the department of Tolima by using a PCR-RFLP of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) for the identification of corn biotype, and a PCR amplifying a FR tandem region of the nuclear DNA to identify the rice biotype. The results diffferentiated three populations of S. frugiperda: a) corn biotype, composed of individuals that generated digestion products with the enzyme Mspl of the COI gene, b) rice biotype, composed of individuals that generated amplification products higher than 500 bp with the FR marker, and finally c) a group of individuals classified as "hybrids" between these markers, product of the cross between a corn biotype female and rice biotype male and vice versa. Individuals genotyped as the corn biotypre were collected exclusively from corn and cotton crops and the individuals genotyped as the rice biotypre were mainly collected from rice crops and in low proportions from corn and cotton groups.

The Pt hybrids represented four events (Mon810 [Cry1A(b)], Bt11 [Cry1A(b)], 176 [Cry1A(b)], and CBH354 [Cry9c]) from seven seed companies. Maize hybrids were grown in four locations ranging from the northern to the southern Texas Panhandle, a semi-arid environment with hot days, cool nights and < 220 mm of rain during the growing season. Maize was infested with each species of corn borer using the Davis applicator at the mid-whorl (first-generation borer) and tassel (second-generation borer) growth stages. All Bt hybrids controlled first generation infestations of both species of corn borers. In contrast, second-generation corn borers were controlled well only by maize with the Mon810, Bt11, or CBH354 events. Second-generation corn borer control by event 176 hybrids was not adequate when compared with the other events. Percentage infestation, larval survival, and damage to most of the event 176 hybrids by second-generation corn borers was similar to non-Pt hybrids. Second-generation SWCB larvae surviving on event 176 were weighed and their survival through the winter (January - March) was monitored. Larvae collected from root crowns of event 176 hybrids weighed the same as those surviving on a non-Bt hybrid from Novartis. SWCB larvae survived the winter equally well in maize stalks of transgenic and non-Pt plants. Yields were not significantly enhanced by control of corn borers by the Bt hybrids.

Phylogenetic and distance relationships of mtDNA generally confirmed traditional species limits in the two species groups and compared favourably with a prior survey of their allozymes. The most notable exceptions were P. rutulus and P. eurymedon, which share their mtDNA, yet maintain numerous morphological and ecological distinctions in sympatry. In organisms with heterogametic females, like the Lepidoptera, the deficiencies of hybrid females that are expected on the basis of Haldane's rule should lead to congruence of mtDNA variants with species boundaries. In the P. glaucus group, the extent of mtDNA differences between species pairs generally coincided with the extent of the Haldane effect, as well as with the presence of major species differences on sex chromosomes (X effect).

A highly contiguous genome assembly of the bat hawkmoth Hyles vespertilio (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae)	GIGASCIENCE			English	Article; Data Paper						genome assembly; PacBio long reads; hawkmoth-silk moth comparison; gene annotation	GENE PREDICTION; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION	Background: Adapted to different ecological niches, moth species belonging to the Hyles genus exhibit a spectacular diversity of larval color patterns. These species diverged similar to 7.5 million years ago, making this rather young genus an interesting system to study a wide range of questions including the process of speciation, ecological adaptation, and adaptive radiation. Results: Here we present a high-quality genome assembly of the bat hawkmoth Hyles vespertilio, the first reference genome of a member of the Hyles genus. We generated 51x Pacific Biosciences long reads with an average read length of 8.9 kb. Pacific Biosciences reads longer than 4 kb were assembled into contigs, resulting in a 651.4-Mb assembly consisting of 530 contigs with an N50 value of 7.5 Mb. The circular mitochondrial contig has a length of 15,303 bp. The H. vespertilio genome is very repeat-rich and exhibits a higher repeat content (50.3%) than other Bombycoidea species such as Bombyx mori (45.7%) and Manduca sexta (27.5%). We developed a comprehensive gene annotation workflow to obtain consensus gene models from different evidence including gene projections, protein homology, transcriptome data, and ab initio predictions. The resulting gene annotation is highly complete with 94.5% of BUSCO genes being completely present, which is higher than the BUSCO completeness of the B. mori (92.2%) and M. sexta (90%) annotations. Conclusions: Our gene annotation strategy has general applicability to other genomes, and the H. vespertilio genome provides a valuable molecular resource to study a range of questions in this genus, including phylogeny, incomplete lineage sorting, speciation, and hybridization.

Smith) is composed of two genetically distinct strains, the so-called corn strain and the rice strain. Whether the two strains differ in their host use is unclear, because laboratory experiments have not been able to show consistent host performance or preference differences between them, and field studies showed high rates of hybridization, as well as some degree asymmetric host use. To determine the distribution of the two strains and their association with host plants, we collected fall armyworm larvae from different crops (corn, rice, alfalfa, and sorghum) and grasses in 15 different localities over 4 yr in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. The strain identity was analyzed using two polymorphisms in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene. We identified the corn and rice haplotypes and three types of populations were characterized based on the frequencies of the individuals that belonged to any of these haplotypes: in 44% of populations the corn haplotype predominated, in 44% of populations the rice haplotype was the most frequent, and 11% of populations showed both haplotypes at similar proportions. In total, eight populations (47%) showed the expected pattern, two populations (12%) were polymorphic within the same field, and seven populations (41%) showed the inverse pattern. Taken together, there was no consistent pattern of host association between the two sympatric genotypes and their respective host plants. This investigation supports the need for additional studies to determine which other forces keep the genotypes separate, and what is the degree of genetic differentiation between these populations.

Population structure and species boundary delimitation of cryptic Dioryctria moths: an integrative approach	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						cytochrome oxidase; elongation factor l alpha; internal transcribed spacer; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; nested clade analysis	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; GENE FLOW; DROSOPHILA-YAKUBA; GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; LEPIDOPTERA-PYRALIDAE; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; SPECIATION; DIVERGENCE; SEQUENCE; NUCLEAR	Accurate delimitation of species boundaries is especially important in cryptic taxa where one or more character sources are uninformative or are in conflict. Rather than relying on a single marker to delimit species, integrative taxonomy uses multiple lines of evidence such as molecular, morphological, behavioural and geographic characters to test species limits. We examine the effectiveness of this approach by testing the delimitation of two cryptic Nearctic species of Dioryctria (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) using three independent molecular markers [cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), second internal transcribed spacer unit (ITS2), and elongation factor la (EF1 alpha)], forewing variation and larval host plant association. Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes do not form reciprocally monophyletic clades, restricted gene flow between COI haplotype groups, and concordance with ITS2 genotypes, forewing variation and host plant associations support delimitation of two Nearctic species: eastern Dioryctria reniculelloides and western Dioryctria pseudotsugella. Conversely, EF1 alpha genotype variation was incongruent with the two previous markers. A case of discordance between COI and ITS2 was detected, suggesting either introgression due to hybridization or retained ancestral polymorphism due to incomplete coalescence. This study is consistent with other similar literature where molecular loci in closely related species progress from shared to fixed haplotypes/alleles, and from polyphyletic to reciprocally monophyletic relationships, although loci may vary in these characteristics despite maintenance of genomic integrity between distinct species. In particular, mtDNA in other studies generally showed a lower rate of fixation of differences than did X-linked or autosomal loci, reinforcing the need to use an integrative approach for delimiting species.

(Salicaceae). Symptoms of herbivory, caused by various insects and game, and, in addition, leaf rust, were assessed in three field locations with varying soils and climates. Eleven damage traits (lost leaf area, leaf discoloration, leaf blisters, leaf-mite symptoms, leaf-margin cuts, and various estimates of shoot-tip damage by a gall midge, game, and lepidopterans) were submitted to QTL analysis. A composite interval mapping approach was used to estimate the number of QTLs, the magnitude of the QTLs, and their position on genetic linkage maps. Most of the identified QTLs were specific for each trait and location, but a few QTLs common across the locations were also detected. Each QTL explained between 8 and 24% of the phenotypic variation, depending on damage trait and field location. Clusters of QTLs for different traits were found at several linkage groups, indicating either a common genetic base or tightly linked QTL. Our results emphasize the need for verification of QTL studies over different environments.

To evaluate the impact of such exposure on larval establishment and survival, Event 176 plants with and without tassels and a non-Bt isoline were infested with O. nubilalis egg masses during anthesis. On the non-Bt plants, larval establishment occurred primarily on pollen collecting in the leaf axils, silks and ears. In contrast, almost no larvae were recovered from leaf axils of the Bt treatments and at least 50% fewer larvae were recovered from the silks and ears during the first 2 weeks after infestation relative to the non-Bt plants. The larvae recovered from Bt treatments weighed significantly less than those observed in the non-Bt isoline at 4 weeks after infestation. By the eighth week, the larval weights of all three treatments were similar in three of four different field tests, suggesting that second generation larvae have the ability to compensate for initial exposure to sublethal doses of Bt toxin. In laboratory assays involving exposure of neonate larvae to silks of Event 176 and non-Bt corn, survival of neonate O. nubilalis was not different although larval weights were significantly reduced (2- to 6-fold). These results suggest that second generation larvae completing development on Event 176 corn do not completely avoid exposure to the Bt toxin, although those that do survive are able to compensate for these sublethal effects. The implication of these results is that Event 176 hybrids do not appear to satisfy requirements for high dose that are recommended for resistance management purposes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The wild type virus was plaque purified by infecting a Heliothis subflexa (BCIRL-HsAM1) cell line and isolating several clones. The mean estimated genomic size of this virus based on PstI, BstEII, StyI, HindIII restriction profiles was estimated to be 106 +/- 2.5 kbp (mean +/- SE). A clone designated as TnMNPV/CmBCL9 was used in bioassays against several lepidopteran pests and in comparative studies with the baculoviruses AcMNPV, AgMNPV, AfMNPV, PxMNPV and HzSNPV of Autographa californica, Anticarsia gemmatalis, Anagrapha falcifera, Plutella xylostella, and Helicoverpa zea, respectively. Infectivity studies showed that TnMNPV/CmBCL9 was highly infectious for Heliothis subflexa and T. ni, with an LC50 value 0.07 occlusion bodies/mm(2) in both species and also infectious for H. zea and Heliothis virescens with LC50 values of 0.22 and 0.27 occlusion bodies/mm(2), respectively. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the isolate and selected baculoviruses revealed profiles that were very similar to AfMNPV but different from the restriction endonuclease profiles of the other baculoviruses. Hybridization studies suggest that the TnMNPV/CmBCL9 was closely related to AfMNPV and AcMNPV-HPP. Further support for this comes from a phylogenetic analysis employing a split-graphs network, comparing the polh, egt, and p10 genes from TnMNPV/CmBCL9 with those from other baculoviruses and suggests that this virus is closely related to the AcMNPV variants, AfMNPV and RoMNPV of Rachiplusia ou.

The phylogenetic history of the old world butterfly subtribe Mycalesina extended: the Mycalesis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) of Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						COI barcode region; Genetic variation; Mycalesis; Phylogeny; Sri Lanka; Taxonomy	GENETIC DIVERSITY; DNA BARCODES; MISSING DATA; INTROGRESSION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; MORPHOLOGY; INFERENCE; MITOCHONDRIAL; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTIONARY	Sri Lanka, together with the Western Ghats, is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, yet little is known about the genetic diversity of the butterflies here. Within the framework of the recently reconstructed molecular phylogeny for the subtribe Mycalesina, we determined the phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic history of the five species of Mycalesis butterflies that are found in Sri Lanka. Sequences of Elongation Factor 1-alpha (EFI-alpha), Wingless (Wg1) and the barcode region of the Cytochrome c Oxidase sub unit 1 (COI) were used to confirm the identity of species, to resolve taxonomic queries and to infer the phylogenetic history of the group. Time-calibrated analysis of genetic data suggests that the Mycalesis species that occur in Sri Lanka diverged in the Miocene (5-23 million years ago). The results of phylogenetic analyses confirmed the following; the endemicity of Mycalesis rama to Sri Lanka; the subspecies classification of M. perseus typhlus and, the close sister relationship of the Sri Lankan M. pamia pamia to M. p. junonia of India. However, whether or not M. subdita of Sri Lanka and India are genetically similar remains unknown. Lastly, genetic evidence emerged suggesting that M. mineus forms a cryptic species complex in the Oriental region, and that in Sri Lanka, there may be occasional hybridization between M. mineus and M. perseus. As a case study of island colonization and diversification by the Mycalesis species, this study further extends our understanding of the Old World butterfly subtribe of Mycalesina.

H. assulta and H. armigera males performed upwind flight in response to the H. assulta sex pheromone blend (93:7). H. armigera responded strongly to the H. armigera blend (3:97), whereas H. assulta males remained inactive upon exposure to this blend. Both species gave clear dose-dependent electrophysiological responses to (Z)-11-hexadecenal. However, (Z)-9-hexadecenal evoked strong dose-dependent electrophysiological responses in H. assulta males but not in H. armigera. The two male F-1 hybrids exhibited similar behavioral responses to two sex pheromone blends and electrophysiological responses to two pheromone components as H. armigera males. This indicated that H. armigera genes appear dominant in determining the behavioral response and electrophysiological responses. Behavioral and electrophysiological responses of backcrosses of male F-1 hybrids (H. armigera female x H. assulta male) with female H. assulta and H. armigera were close to that of H. assulta and H. armigera, respectively. However, backcrosses of female F-1 hybrids (H. assulta female x H. armigera male) with male H. assulta and H. armigera showed reduced behavioral responses but normal electrophysiological responses compared to males of the respective parental line.

Morphometry as a tool in species identification: a study with special reference to species of the genus Mycalesis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA			English	Article						Discriminant analysis; morphology; Mycalesis; traditional morphometrics	BARCODE REFERENCE LIBRARY; BUTTERFLIES LEPIDOPTERA; REVISED CLASSIFICATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SYSTEMATICS; PHYLOGENY; SATYRINAE; HESPERIIDAE; POLYPHENISM; AFFINITIES	Morphological variability among four species of Mycalesis in Sri Lanka that are difficult to discriminate due to their morphological similarity was investigated to identify characters that distinguish species more accurately. Using traditional morphometrics, 90 variables from the wing, forelegs and genitalia of M. perseus typhlus, M. milieus polydecta, M. subdita and M. rama were measured and analysed. A set of 19 characters of the wing, male genitalia and forelegs were identified to discriminate species. Results of the analysis showed that male specimens were discriminated with nine wing characters and five characters of genitalia. Females could be discriminated with three wing characters and two foreleg characters. Male specimens of M. p. typhlus and M. m. polydecta showed the greatest morphological differentiation, while females of M. subdita and M. rama were the most similar species. These results were used to improve the currently available identification key. Two instances of possible hybridisation were discovered: one between M.p. typhlus and M. m. polydecta and the other between M. p. typhlus and M. subdita. Hence, the species of Mycalesis, particularly M. p. typhlus, M. m. polydecta and M. subdita may not be strictly reproductively isolated in Sri Lanka. Preliminary comparisons of M. p. typhlus in Sri Lanka with M. p. tabitha of India indicated that the Sri Lankan subspecies is unlikely to be a synonym.

A previous study using several geographic isolates indicated that two types of NPV, Spodoptera littoralis NPV (SpIiNPV) and S. litura NPV (SpItNPV) types, were isolated from the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura (Fabricius), a polyphagous insect that causes serious damage to many forage crops and vegetables. That study also indicated that the SpIiNPV type was widely distributed in japan. Here, we investigated the genotypic and phenotypic variation of cloned NPVs that infect S. litura; such variation is an important resource for biological control agents, and may represent the genetic diversity of an NPV species. Eighteen genotypically distinct NPVs were cloned from four field-collected NPV isolates using an in vivo cloning technique. They were divided into two virus types according to the similarity of banding patterns of DNA fragments generated by restriction endonucleases, and Southern hybridization analysis. Partial polyhedrin gene sequences revealed that the two types corresponded to SpIiNPV and SpItNPV. Bioassays seem to suggest that the SpIiNPV virus type was, overall, more infectious and killed S. litura larvae faster, but yielded fewer viral occlusion bodies, than the SpItNPV type. These data provide a basis for explaining the distribution pattern of SpIiNPV and SpItNPV types in S. Iitura populations in Japan. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

E. Smith). Whorl leaves, silks, and kernels, either fresh or oven-dried and ground with a mill, were incorporated into a dilute pinto bean diet and bioassayed against neonate, 3-, or 6-day-old larvae. Regardless of age of the larvae, results with the diet bioassay using fresh silks, oven-dried silks or fresh kernels were highly correlated with those! for the fresh silk bioassay. Differences in susceptibility between insect species to the CrylA(b) toxin produced in the transgenic plants were also readily discernable using the diet bioassay. Based on results of the bioassays, Novartis sweet corn hybrids containing a crylA(b) gene gene for delta-endotoxin production were very highly resistant to leaf, silk and kernel feeding by the corn earworm and highly resistant to leaf and silk feeding by the fall armyworm.

E. Smith). The experiments were conducted using a randomized complete block design with treatments in a factorial arrangement with 6 replications. Treatments consisted of 2 insect colonies, an early and a late planting period, 2 plant growth stages, and 4 single cross maize hybrids (2 susceptible and 2 resistant to leaf-feeding by FAW) at each location. Each plant in an experiment was infested with 30 neonate FAW larvae when the plants of the second planting within each planting period reached the V-4 (Tifton) or V-8 (Mississippi State) stage. Each plant was visually scored for leaf damage 7 and 14 days after infestation. Statistical analyses revealed interactions among factors resulting in inferences having to be made using nonmarginal means. Significant differences in rating scores within each factor (insect colony, planting date, and plant growth stage) were found for some comparisons. However, none of these factors appreciably altered our ability to distinguish between resistant and susceptible genotypes which is the objective of screening.

Recent studies suggest that individuals feeding on maize in Europe should be referred to O. nubilalis (sensu nov.), while those infesting dicots as Ostrinia scapulalis (sensu nov.). We test if the clear genetic distinctiveness among individuals of O. nubilalis living on maize vs. dicots is tracked by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We used fragments of COI and COII genes of 32 individuals traditionally recognized as O. nubilalis collected on three host plants, maize, mugwort and hop, growing in different parts of Poland. In addition, we reconstructed the mtDNA phylogeny of Ostrinia species based on our data and sequences retrieved from GenBank to assess host and/or biogeographic patterns. We also compared haplotype variation found in Poland (east-central Europe) with other regions (Anatolia, Eastern Europe, Balkans, Far East, North America). Our study showed high mtDNA diversity of O. nubilalis in Poland in comparison with other regions and revealed rare haplotypes likely of Asian origin. We did not find distinct mtDNA haplotypes in larvae feeding on maize vs. dicotyledonous plants. Phylogenetic analyses showed an apparent lack of mtDNA divergence among putatively distinct lineages belonging to the O. nubilalis group as identical haplotypes are shared by Asian and European individuals. We argue that human-mediated dispersal, hybridization and sporadic host jumps are likely responsible for the lack of a geographic pattern in mtDNA variation.

Influence of transgenic corn expressing insecticidal protein of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner on natural populations of corn earworm (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) and southwestern corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae)	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						transgenic corn; Diatraea grandiosella; Helicoverpa zea; Zea mays	ZEA LEPIDOPTERA; FALL ARMYWORM; RESISTANCE; HELIOTHIS	A 2-yr study was conducted to measure the influence of transgenic corn, Zea mays L., expressing the Cry1Ab endotoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) (Bt) by means of Event MON810 on natural populations of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Diatraea grandiosella (Dyar). The studies were conducted at Leland and Morgan City, MS, in 1999 and at Morgan City in 2000. Although total numbers of H. zea larvae were not significantly different on transgenic corn hybrids compared with their near-isogenic parent lines, fewer large larvae were found on the transgenic hybrids. Differences in H. zea larval growth were noticeable when larvae fed on Bt corn vs non-Bt corn. The delay in larval growth for insects within a single generation, which could possibly result in asynchronous mating between insecticide resistant and susceptible insects, was observed for larvae feeding on plants expressing the Bt toxin. Diatraea grandiosella caused limited damage to the transgenic corn hybrids compared with their near-isogenic parent lines. Yields were not significantly greater for the Bt corn hybrids compared with their near-isogenic parent lines. Yields were not significantly greater for the Bt corn hybrids compared with the near-isogenic, non-Bt corn parents; however, there was a trend toward higher yields for Bt hybrids compared with their near-isogenic non-Bt parents.

CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; PINK STEM BORER; LEPIDOPTERA; POPULATION	The pink stem borer (PSB) (Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre, 1827; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is the main insect pest of maize (Zea mays L., Poaceae) in the Mediterranean area. Maize varieties partially resistant to PSB have been identified, but few studies have documented the mechanisms of resistance involved. The objectives of this research were to study the levels of leaf and sheath antibiosis of a maize population, EPS12, and determine whether antibiosis improved over the selection process for less stalk tunneling. A hybrid check and two Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) hybrids were also examined. Several bioassays were carried out in a control chamber to evaluate antibiosis of maize leaves and sheaths against PSB larvae. Leaf antibiosis was significantly higher for EPS12 than for the hybrid check and sheath antibiosis was low for all non-Bt hybrids studied. We conclude that leaf and sheath antibiosis was not significantly improved during the selection process. Future efforts should look for other possible mechanisms of resistance, such as stem rind antibiosis.

The green-veined white (Pieris napi L.), its Pierine relatives, and the systematics dilemmas of divergent character sets (Lepidoptera, Pieridae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						character conflict; cytochrome oxidase subunit I; evolution; mitochondrial DNA; molecular systematics; phylogeography; polymorphism; polyphenism; ribosomal genes; speciation	PHYLOGENETIC ESTIMATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SEED SET; BUTTERFLIES; SELECTION; COLIAS; ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION; GENETICS; DIFFERENTIATION	The butterfly Pieris napi (L.) and relatives exemplify recently evolving taxa, exhibiting variation that makes their evolutionary dynamics interesting, but their systematics difficult. Wing-pattern characters commonly used to distinguish these Holarctic insects display both genetic polymorphism and environmentally-cued polyphenism. Often, these causes of variation are confounded, impairing the characters' phylogenetic usefulness. DNA sequences of four mitochondrial genes offer an independent view of pierine phylogeny. Sampling diverse relatives within family Pieridae assists resolution of the P. napi complex, suggests previous underestimation of clade diversity in subfamily Pierinae, and shows that other genera near Pieris also display confusions of wing-pattern-based phylogenetic inference. The European P. napi is sister to all North American taxa, and is well diverged from them all in sequences. The North American taxa comprise a northern subclade including Pieris oleracea, and questionably distinct Pieri'angelika', and a southern subclade including distinct Pieris virginiensis, Pieris marginalis, and Pieris macdunnoughii, and other regional entities yet to be clarified. Weak bootstrap support for some nodes in this group arises from a closeness of sequence identity rather than character conflict; more sequence data and denser geographical sampling may resolve these nodes more clearly. Evidence of reproductive isolation, from other experimental hybridization studies, agrees with the DNA results where these conflict with other divergent character sets. The system offers much promise for a deeper understanding of character evolution in relation to phyletic differentiation. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London.

The newly hatched larvae of all strains were reared for experiment under same standard conditions. Studied strains are ranked based on the average of evaluation index method and sub-ordinate function method. From the obtained results, it was clear that different strains of silkworm B. mori showed different performances based on productive traits. The analysis of variance regarding the studied traits showed that different strains have significant difference for traits (P < 0.01). Totally, W2-11-19-2[110] (2030.234), W2-11-19-3 (2025.089), BH-4 (1981.516), 104x110 (1963.656) and 17 (1935.046) showed higher evaluation index values. W2-11-19-3 (19.868), W2-11-19-2 [ 110] (2030.234), BH-4 (18.857), 104x110 (18.560) and 17 (17.917) showed higher sub-ordinate function values. All strains with the same origin did not group together because they had different biological and development performance. The main groups were also divided into separate sub-groups. Three sub-groups included various strains. Several strains were grouped together and far from other silkworm strains, indicating that they might be suitable for future crossings, maintenance of parental strains and hybridizations with peanut cocoon strains so as to maximize heterosis and to avoid depression inbreeding. After evaluation by two statistical methods (evaluation index method and sub-ordinate function method), some oval type strains that stood within high ranks were identified as potential parents for further breeding programme.

Because of relatively shallow genome coverage, the silkworm genome remains fragmented, hampering annotation and comparative genome studies. For a more complete genome analysis, we developed extended scaffolds combining physical maps with improved genetic maps. Results: We mapped 1,755 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences onto 28 linkage groups using a recombining male backcross population, yielding an average inter-SNP distance of 0.81 cM (about 270 kilobases). We constructed 6,221 contigs by fingerprinting clones from three BAC libraries digested with different restriction enzymes, and assigned a total of 724 single copy genes to them by BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) search of the BAC end sequences and high-density BAC filter hybridization using expressed sequence tags as probes. We assigned 964 additional expressed sequence tags to linkage groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a nonrecombining female backcross population. Altogether, 361.1 megabases of BAC contigs and singletons were integrated with a map containing 1,688 independent genes. A test of synteny using Oxford grid analysis with more than 500 silkworm genes revealed six versus 20 silkworm linkage groups containing eight or more orthologs of Apis versus Tribolium, respectively. Conclusion: The integrated map contains approximately 10% of predicted silkworm genes and has an estimated 76% genome coverage by BACs. This provides a new resource for improved assembly of whole-genome shotgun data, gene annotation and positional cloning, and will serve as a platform for comparative genomics and gene discovery in Lepidoptera and other insects.

J	Gibbs, MJ; Armstrong, JS; Gibbs, AJ				Gibbs, MJ; Armstrong, JS; Gibbs, AJ			Individual sequences in large sets of gene sequences may be distinguished efficiently by combinations of shared sub-sequences	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROBE SELECTION; DNA; DIAGNOSTICS; STABILITY; PCR	Background: Most current DNA diagnostic tests for identifying organisms use specific oligonucleotide probes that are complementary in sequence to, and hence only hybridise with the DNA of one target species. By contrast, in traditional taxonomy, specimens are usually identified by 'dichotomous keys' that use combinations of characters shared by different members of the target set. Using one specific character for each target is the least efficient strategy for identification. Using combinations of shared bisectionally-distributed characters is much more efficient, and this strategy is most efficient when they separate the targets in a progressively binary way. Results: We have developed a practical method for finding minimal sets of sub-sequences that identify individual sequences, and could be targeted by combinations of probes, so that the efficient strategy of traditional taxonomic identification could be used in DNA diagnosis. The sizes of minimal sub-sequence sets depended mostly on sequence diversity and sub-sequence length and interactions between these parameters. We found that 201 distinct cytochrome oxidase subunit-1 (CO1) genes from moths ( Lepidoptera) were distinguished using only 15 sub-sequences 20 nucleotides long, whereas only 8-10 sub-sequences 6-10 nucleotides long were required to distinguish the CO1 genes of 92 species from the 9 largest orders of insects. Conclusion: The presence/absence of sub-sequences in a set of gene sequences can be used like the questions in a traditional dichotomous taxonomic key; hybridisation probes complementary to such sub-sequences should provide a very efficient means for identifying individual species, subtypes or genotypes. Sequence diversity and sub-sequence length are the major factors that determine the numbers of distinguishing sub-sequences in any set of sequences.

To investigate the function of 14-3-3 in Spodoptera litura, the full length of 14-3-4 zeta was cloned from S. litura on the basis of an expressed sequence tag of 14-3-3 from the S. litura fat body suppression subtractive hybridization library, and named SpL14-3-3 zeta SpL14-3-3 cDNA was 1196 bp with an open reading frame of 744 bp, encoding 247 amino acids. Multiple alignment analysis revealed the putative amino acids shared >80% homology with14-3-3 zeta from other organisms and shared typical conservative structures. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed SpL14-3-3 was closely related to other available Lepidoptera 14-3-3 Real-time PCR analysis indicated SpL14-3-3 zeta was expressed throughout the developmental stages of S. litura, with a relatively high expression level in pre-pupa, and was expressed constitutively in all examined tissues with relatively high levels in hemocytes and midgut Moreover, the transcription level of SpL14-3-3 zeta could be induced by Nomuraea rileyi infection, up-regulated in hemocytes, followed by head, fat body and midgut Knocking down SpL14-3-3 transcripts by RNAi significantly increased S. litura sensitivity to fungal infection, and resulted in higher mortality of S. litura during the larval development. These results provide novel insights into the 14-3-zeta signal regulation which may be related to host defense as well as larval development in S. litura. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Building-Up of a DNA Barcode Library for True Bugs (Insecta: Hemiptera: Heteroptera) of Germany Reveals Taxonomic Uncertainties and Surprises	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BIOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATIONS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; COLEOPTERA; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EPHEMEROPTERA; SYSTEMATICS; POPULATION	During the last few years, DNA barcoding has become an efficient method for the identification of species. In the case of insects, most published DNA barcoding studies focus on species of the Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Hymenoptera and especially Lepidoptera. In this study we test the efficiency of DNA barcoding for true bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera), an ecological and economical highly important as well as morphologically diverse insect taxon. As part of our study we analyzed DNA barcodes for 1742 specimens of 457 species, comprising 39 families of the Heteroptera. We found low nucleotide distances with a minimum pairwise K2P distance <2.2% within 21 species pairs (39 species). For ten of these species pairs (18 species), minimum pairwise distances were zero. In contrast to this, deep intraspecific sequence divergences with maximum pairwise distances >2.2% were detected for 16 traditionally recognized and valid species. With a successful identification rate of 91.5% (418 species) our study emphasizes the use of DNA barcodes for the identification of true bugs and represents an important step in building-up a comprehensive barcode library for true bugs in Germany and Central Europe as well. Our study also highlights the urgent necessity of taxonomic revisions for various taxa of the Heteroptera, with a special focus on various species of the Miridae. In this context we found evidence for on-going hybridization events within various taxonomically challenging genera (e.g. Nabis Latreille, 1802 (Nabidae), Lygus Hahn, 1833 (Miridae), Phytocoris Fallen, 1814 (Miridae)) as well as the putative existence of cryptic species (e.g. Aneurus avenius (Duffour, 1833) (Aradidae) or Orius niger (Wolff, 1811) (Anthocoridae)).

To evaluate the impact of such exposure, diapausing larvae were collected from Event 176 and conventional hybrids and compared for rates of pupation, parasitism, fitness (pupal weight, longevity, and fecundity) and susceptibility to the Cry1Ab toxin. Larvae completing development on Event 176 corn exhibited approximately 10% higher survival rates and correspondingly lower parasitism rates than larvae completing development on conventional hybrids. No significant differences were detected in pupal weight, fecundity, longevity or susceptibility to the Cry1Ab Bt toxin. These results indicate that survival on Event 176 corn are not adversely affect fitness and does not cause increased tolerance to the Cry1Ab toxin in subsequent generations.

Genome and transcriptome analysis of the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua reveals targets for pest control	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS			English	Article						Beet armyworm; Spodoptera exigua; whole genome; transcriptomics; gene expression; pest control	MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; PROTEIN EVOLUTION; MODEL SELECTION; RNA-SEQ; LEPIDOPTERA; EXPRESSION; NOCTUIDAE; GENES; REPAT; IDENTIFICATION	The genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) includes some of the most infamous insect pests of cultivated plants including Spodoptera frugiperda, Spodoptera litura, and Spodoptera exigua. To effectively develop targeted pest control strategies for diverse Spodoptera species, genomic resources are highly desired. To this aim, we provide the genome assembly and developmental transcriptome comprising all major life stages of S. exigua, the beet armyworm. Spodoptera exigua is a polyphagous herbivore that can feed on > 130 host plants, including several economically important crops. The 419 Mb beet armyworm genome was sequenced from a female S. exigua pupa. Using a hybrid genome sequencing approach (Nanopore long-read data and Illumina short read), a high-quality genome assembly was achieved (N50 =1.1 Mb). An official gene set (18,477 transcripts) was generated by automatic annotation and by using transcriptomic RNA-seq datasets of 18 S. exigua samples as supporting evidence. In-depth analyses of developmental stage-specific expression combined with gene tree analyses of identified homologous genes across Lepidoptera genomes revealed four potential genes of interest (three of them Spodoptera-specific) upregulated during first- and third-instar larval stages for targeted pest-outbreak management. The beet armyworm genome sequence and developmental transcriptome covering all major developmental stages provide critical insights into the biology of this devastating polyphagous insect pest species worldwide. In addition, comparative genomic analyses across Lepidoptera significantly advance our knowledge to further control other invasive Spodoptera species and reveals potential lineage-specific target genes for pest control strategies.

The Bt hybrids represented four events (Mon810, Bt11, 176, and CBH354) from seven seed companies. The maize hybrids were grown in four locations that ranged from the northern to southern length of the Texas Panhandle. A semi-arid environment with hot days-cool nights and <220 mm of rain characterize this region. Maize in this region is irrigated with furrow or moving truss application systems. Maize was infested with each species of corn borer at the tasseling growth stage using the Davis applicator. Natural infestations of corn earworm were allowed to develop. Hybrids of events Mon810, Bt11, and CBH354 provided good control of corn borers in shanks and ears. Event 176 hybrids did not provide good control in the shanks and ears because Bt is not expressed in reproductive tissue in this event. No Bt transgenic maize hybrid provided consistent control of CEW larvae on kernels. Feeding gallery length on ears from CEW feeding was sometimes shorter in Mon810 and Bt11 hybrids than in the non-Bt hybrids. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

(Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), was studied on maize varieties, viz. Neelum (Yellow), Sadaf (white), Agaiti-85 (Yellow) and Pak Afgyous (White), four hybrid varieties, 32B33 Hyb (Yellow), 8711 Hyb (Yellow), 8288 Hyb (Yellow) and 33W86 Hyb (Yellow) and two basic lines, EV-5098 (Yellow) and EV-6098 (White) in choice and no choice bioassays. The biological parameters such as development time, moth emergence and grain damage were correlated with phenolics, flavonoids and tannic acid in these varieties. Results showed that moth took longer time to develop and less moth emergence and grain damage on 8711 Hyb and 32W86 Hyb and closely followed by Agaiti-85 and Pak Afgyous. There was non-significant difference in fecudity and adult moth weight with respect to varieities in two assays. Egg hatching was non-significant in two assays but varieties were significantly different in this respect. Maximum egg hatching was observed on 8288 Hyb that was significantly different from other varieties. The significantly different minimum hatching in variety 8711 Hyb had non-significant difference with Agaiti-85, EV-5098 and Sadaf. The maximum total phenolics (2.16 gallic acid equivalents g(-1) dry matter) in 32B33 Hyb had significant difference with all other varieties. 8288 Hyb, EV-5098 and 8711 Hyb having minimum total phenolics (0.86, 0.91 and 0.95, respectively) had non-significant difference among themselves. The maximum total flavonoids (0.32) were present in variety 32W86 Hyb. Minimum total flavonoids (0.04) were found in EV-5098 (0.04) being non-significantly different from Agaiti-85 (0.08). The minimum amount of tannic acid (0.6) was noted in varieties 32B33 Hyb and Pak Afgyous. In Neelum, the tannic acid was maximum (0.68) and had non-significant difference with Pak Afgyous, 32W86 Hyb and 32B33 Hyb. The correlation between phenolics and biological parameters revealed the association between them and is discussed with respect to future studies.

Currently available information on host prothoracic gland inactivation in this host-parasitoid system is reported here. Prothoracic glands of H. virescens mature larvae show a depressed biosynthetic activity, without undergoing gross morphological disruption. The ultrastructure of gland cells is characterized by minor parasitoid-induced changes, with the rough endoplasmic reticulum appearing more developed and electron-dense than in nonparasitized controls. Eventually, the cells of prothoracic glands of parasitized host last instar larvae die but maintain their structural integrity. The inactivation of pupally committed host prothoracic glands is achieved through the disruption of the PTTH signal transduction pathway. The second messenger cAMP appears to be normally produced in response to PTTH stimulation of glands explanted from parasitized host larvae, however the downstream activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase does not appear to occur. In fact, a marked underphosphorylation of regulatory target proteins is observed. This underphosphorylation is associated with a significant reduction in general protein synthesis, which appears to be blocked at the translational level, to a redirection of specific protein synthesis and to a drastic suppression of ecdysteroidogenesis. These parameters appeared to be correlated in a kinetic time-course study, confirming their functional link. C. nigriceps polydnavirus (CnPDV) plays a major role in the inactivation of pupally committed host prothoracic glands, while putative factors occurring in the host haemolymph do not seem to be of particular importance at that developmental stage. Southern blot hybridization indicates the occurrence of PKI(protein kinase inhibitor)-like genes in the C. nigriceps genome, which, in contrast, are undetectable in H. virescens.

The objective of this research was to identify genotypes with natural resistance to damage by fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), and corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and their relationship with ear rot caused by Fusarium spp. Link (Nectriaceae). Samples were collected from September to November 2019 from hybrids and native maize in nine plots in Puebla and Morelos states. Ear rot pathogens and Lepidoptera found in plots were morphologically identified; ear rot incidence, severity, and damage caused by the pests were evaluated. Data of ear rot, leaf damage, and ear damage were adjusted by arcsine square root and analysis of variance (ANOVA), and means were compared by a Tukey multiple range test (p = 0.05). Fusarium spp. was found with 15.04 to 32.01% severity; damage by fall armyworm and corn earworm ranged from 23.63 to 46.96%, with galleries as long as 4.77 cm. The amount of ear rot was proportional to damage by Lepidoptera, demonstrating relationship between injury by these insects and ear rot severity caused by Fusarium spp. in hybrids and native cultivars in different areas, cultural practices, and production systems. Genotypes more resistant to damage by pests were Black Native from San Miguel, Teotlalco, Puebla; Pioneer 30F35 from Contla, Puebla; Pioneer P4028W from Tetelilla, Morelos; and Pioneer P4028W from Tepalcingo, Morelos.

Current pest management techniques rely heavily on pesticides but trichome-based host-plant resistance may reduce pesticide use. 2 A review of the literature is provided on trichomes of wild Lycopersicon species and the effects of trichome-based host-plant resistance on arthropods. Solvents have been used to remove glandular trichome exudates and the resulting dimminution of their effects quantified. Correlational approaches to assess the relationship between the different trichome types and effects on pests have also been used. 3 Most studies have focused on Lepidoptera and Hemiptera, although some work has included Coleoptera, Diptera and Acarina, and both antibiotic and antixenotic effects have been demonstrated. 4 Natural enemies are a cornerstone of international pest management and this review discusses how the compatibility of this approach with trichome-based host-plant resistance is uncertain because of the reported negative effects of trichomes on one dipteran, one hemipteran and several Hymenoptera. 5 For trichome-based host-plant resistance to be utilized as a pest management tool, trichomes of wild species need to be introgressed into the cultivated tomato. Hybrids between the cultivated tomato and the wild species Lycopersicon hirsutum f. glabratum, Lycopersicon pennellii and Lycopersicon cheesmanii f. minor have been produced and useful levels of resistance to Acarina, Diptera and Hemiptera pests have been exhibited, although these effects may be tempered by effects on natural enemies. 6 This review proposes that studies on genetic links between fruit quality and resistance, field studies to determine the compatibility of natural enemies and trichome-based host-plant resistance, and a strong focus on L. cheesmanii f. minor, are all priorities for further research that will help realize the potential of this natural defence mechanism in pest management.

However, the increased scientific reports of resistance development in insect pest against insecticidal delta-endotoxins, produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, provide impetus for the development of alternative insect management strategies. The present study was conducted to investigate the importance of targeted expression of a hybrid insecticidal gene (SN19) in potatoes. For this purpose, two plant expression vectors were constructed by cloning hybrid SN19 gene (cry1Ba-domain I-III and cry1Ia-domain II) under the control of a wound-inducible promoter isolated from Asparagus officinalis (AoPR1) and CaMV 35S promoter, and were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA 105. Four potato genotypes (Marabel, Innovator, Tokat 10/1 and Tokat 6/24) were transformed with EHA 105 strain harboring pTF101.1 35S-SN19 and pTF101.1 AoPR1-SN19 constructs. Phosphinothricin (PPT) was used at concentration of 1 mg/l for selection of primary transformants. PCR results showed the presence of both introduced SN19 and bar genes in 43 plants out of total 154 putative transgenics. Expression of SN19 protein in primary transformants was confirmed by Western blot assays. The mechanical wounding of transgenic plants exhibited more accumulated levels of SN19 proteins during post wounding period. Leaf biotoxicity assays with Colorado potato beetle (Coleoptera) and tomato leafminer (Lepidoptera) exhibited 100% mortality of the pests in primary transformants. Based on our mortality results with both constructs, we concluded that the potato transgenic lines exhibited targeted expression of insecticidal gene under the control of AoPR1 promoter upon insect wounding with eliminated toxicity of Cry protein and hence can be further used effectively in potato breeding programme.

J	Williams, WP; Buckley, PM; Windham, GL				Williams, WP; Buckley, PM; Windham, GL			Southwestern corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) damage and aflatoxin accumulation in maize	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						southwestern corn borer; aflatoxin; corn; plant resistance	ASPERGILLUS-FLAVUS; KERNEL INFECTION; GERMPLASM LINE; CONTAMINATION; REGISTRATION; RESISTANCE; FOODS; FEEDS	Aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen, is produced by the fungus Aspergillus flavus Link: Fr. Drought, high temperatures, and insect damage contribute to increased levels of aflatoxin contamination in corn, Zea mays L. Plant resistance is widely considered a desirable method of reducing aflatoxin contamination. Germplasm lines with aflatoxin resistance have been developed. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether crosses among these lines exhibited resistance to southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar, and to assess the effects of southwestern corn borer feeding on aflatoxin accumulation. Differences in ear damage among southwestern corn borer infested hybrids were significant. Estimates of general combining ability effects indicated that the lines Mp80:04, Mp420, and Mp488 contributed to reduced ear damage, and SC213 and T165 contributed to greater damage when used in hybrids. Mean aflatoxin levels were 254 ng/g for hybrids infested with southwestern corn borer larvae and 164 ng/g for noninfested hybrids in 2000 when environmental conditions were conducive to aflatoxin production. In contrast, the overall mean aflatoxin level for southwestern corn borer infested hybrids was only 5 ng/g in 1999 when environmental conditions did not favor aflatoxin accumulation. Crosses that included lines selected for aflatoxin resistance as parents (Mp,80:04 and Mp313E) exhibited lower levels of aflatoxin contamination both with and without southwestern corn borer infestation in 2000. Only the experimental line Mp80:04 contributed significantly to both reduced southwestern corn borer damage and reduced aflatoxin contamination.

The role of leaf cellulose content in determining host plant preferences of three defoliating insects present in the Andean-Patagonian forest	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; biomechanical properties; feeding preferences; native forest; phytophagous; Thurstone scale	BIOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES; NOTHOFAGUS; HERBIVORY; QUALITY; TREE; ARCHITECTURE; TOUGHNESS; SELECTION; GROWTH; CATERPILLARS	Phytophagous insects choose their feeding resources according to their own requirements in addition to properties of the host plants, such as biomechanical defences. The feeding preferences of the native folivorous insects of the Andean-Patagonian forest (Argentina) have rarely been studied. These environments present a wide diversity and abundance of insects associated with trees of the Nothofagus and Lophozonia (Nothofagaceae) genera, which represent the main tree species of the forests of the southern hemisphere. In particular, Lophozonia alpina and Lophozonia obliqua are of great interest because they have a wide distribution, a high capacity for hybridization and exhibit great phenotypic plasticity. This versatility causes substantial variation in the biomechanical properties of leaves, affecting the feeding preferences of insects. The purpose of this work was to study the food selection behaviour of three leaf-chewing insects (Polydrusus nothofagii, Polydrususroseaus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and Perzelia arda (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae)) associated with L.alpina and L.obliqua as host plants. Based on their choices, our aim was to determine a preference scale for each insect species and the variables on which these preferences were based. Therefore, we selected trees of L.alpina and L.obliqua, measured several properties such as cellulose content and recorded which leaves were eaten. As a result, we determined that the three species of insects feed on both host plants but prefer the leaves of L.obliqua, with cellulose content being the main determining factor for their decisions. However, in the case of P.arda, there was a positive relationship between cellulose and host plant preference, whereas there was an opposite relationship for the weevils. We conclude that during feeding selection, there are some properties of the leaves that have a more important role than others and that the same property does not exert the same behavioural response in all folivorous insects.

However, little is known about the mechanism of insecticidal activity of these proteins. We report here a 65 kDa Protein present in the extract of the larval midgut membrane of Helicoverpa armigera as putative receptor for Bt CryIA delta-endotoxin, on the basis of binding affinity to Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac but not to Cry2A. The protein has been highly purified by a combination of chromatography, electrophoresis and isoelectrifocussing techniques. The isolated protein exists as an oligodimer in its native form. The purified protein exhibits amino-peptidase activity. N-terminal sequence of the purified protein shows no homology to protein sequences in the Gen bank (NCBI) protein database. Degenerate primers were designed, based on N-terminal sequence of the purified protein and hybridization of Probe with mRNAs of Helicoverpa armigera indicated sequence complementarity. The structural gene of this purified protein was cloned in pGEX-4T-3 expression vector. The cloned Protein exhibited binding properties, aminopeptidase activity and other characteristics of native protein of Helicoverpa armigera. Larval mortality of Helicoverpa armigera to CryIA toxin was considerably reduced when the larvae were pre-fed a diet containing antibodies to the 65 kDa protein, presumably due to blocking of the receptor sites in BBMVs.

The sibling species Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis meet in a narrow hybrid zone believed to be maintained by temperature thresholds acting independently on both species. The present study tests if this assertion is true for the cold-adapted species, P. canadensis, which is presumed to be limited by the effect of high temperatures in late summer and/or autumn on pupal survival. 2. Three experiments were conducted examining the effects of: (i) short periods of high temperature stress in autumn, (ii) prolonged warm temperatures in autumn, and (iii) temperatures simulating warmer winters/longer springs upon the survival of P. canadensis and P. glaucus. 3. Results indicated that short periods of high temperatures did not induce the high C mortality rates required to be the key factor limiting the range of P canadensis. However, P canadensis did exhibit a considerably lower tolerance to high temperature extremes, prolonged warm temperatures in autumn, and conditions simulating shorter/warmer winters than P glaucus. 4. Differences in temperature tolerance throughout the pupal stage are likely to be a significant factor in maintaining the southern range limit of P. canadensis. Further warming as may occur during climate change, particularly in winter and spring, will likely affect the dynamics of southerly populations of P. canadensis.	[Mercader, R. J.; Scriber, J.

(Hubner), damage and grain yield in commercial strip plots across Ontario in 1996 and 1997. Bt corn hybrids reduced stalk tunneling damage by 88-100%. In 1996, minimal damage was found in locations where only one generation of European corn borer occurred per year. Bt corn proved its greatest potential for reducing the number and length of, cavities below the primary ear in locations where two generations of European corn borer were present. A yield response to using Bt hybrids only occurred when levels of tunneling damage exceeded 6 cm in length. European corn borer infestations resulted in a 6 and 2.4% reduction in yield for 1996 and 1997, respectively, when Bt hybrids were compared with their non-Bt isolines. A linear relationship was found between tunnel length per plant in centimeters (x) and yield protection (%) obtained from using Bt corn (y) (y = 1.02 + 0.005x, r(2) = 0.7217). At a premium of $34.58 Canadian (CDN) per hectare for Bt corn seed, an infestation of at least 6 ern of corn borer tunneling per plant was required to break even at a market price for corn of $2.50 per bushel CDN. During the period of study, low infestations (0-2 cm) of European corn borer occurred at 25% of the locations assessed, moderate infestations (4-6 cm) occurred at 42% of the locations, and high infestations (>6 cm) occurred at 33% of the locations. At a corn price of $3.00 per bushel CDN and seed premiums of $34.58 per hectare CDN, 5 ern of tunneling was required for a return on investment in Bt seed, comprising only 55% of the growers in the study. With infestations of more than 6 cm of tunneling occurring only 33% of the time, a return on seed investment would be realized in only one of three growing seasons. At a seed premium of $24.70 per hectare CDN per year, at least $74 per hectare CDN in the year of infestation would be required to make up for the two years of no. return. In this study, a $74 per hectare CDN return at a corn price of $9.26 per hectare CDN with >16 cm of tunneling damage would have occurred only 7.3% of the time.

Because the hatch rate of eggs varies with maternal age, age-specific fecundity was calculated based on the numbers of hatched eggs to reveal the biological characteristics of H. armigera accurately. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate (lambda) and mean generation time (T) of H. armigera were 0.0853 d(-1), 1.0890 d(-1) and 46.6 d, respectively, on Z. mays and 0.1015 d(-1), 1.1068d(-1), and 46.3 d, respectively, on the artificial diet. There were significant differences in the intrinsic rate of increase and finite rate between two treatments. The age-stage life expectancy and reproductive value also were calculated. The relationships among the net reproductive rate, the mean female fecundity, the number of emerged females, and the total number of individuals used in the life table study are consistent with theoretical expectations. We recommend the age-stage, two-sex life table for use in insect demographic studies to incorporate both sexes and the variation in developmental rate among individuals and to obtain accurate population parameters. The artificial diet is more suitable for the mass rearing of H. armigera.

This is especially true for skippers (Hesperiidae), one of the most species-rich and poorly studied butterfly families. Methods: To infer a robust phylogenomic hypothesis for Hesperiidae, we sequenced nearly 400 loci using Anchored Hybrid Enrichment and sampled all tribes and more than 120 genera of skippers. Molecular datasets were analyzed using maximum-likelihood, parsimony and coalescent multi-species phylogenetic methods. Results: All analyses converged on a novel, robust phylogenetic hypothesis for skippers. Different optimality criteria and methodologies recovered almost identical phylogenetic trees with strong nodal support at nearly all nodes and all taxonomic levels. Our results support Coeliadinae as the sister group to the remaining skippers, the monotypic Euschemoninae as the sister group to all other subfamilies but Coeliadinae, and the monophyly of Eudaminae plus Pyrginae. Within Pyrginae, Celaenorrhinini and Tagiadini are sister groups, the Neotropical firetips, Pyrrhopygini, are sister to all other tribes but Celaenorrhinini and Tagiadini. Achlyodini is recovered as the sister group to Carcharodini, and Erynnini as sister group to Pyrgini. Within the grass skippers (Hesperiinae), there is strong support for the monophyly of Aeromachini plus remaining Hesperiinae. The giant skippers (Agathymus and Megathymus) once classified as a subfamily, are recovered as monophyletic with strong support, but are deeply nested within Hesperiinae. Conclusions: Anchored Hybrid Enrichment sequencing resulted in a large amount of data that built the foundation for a new, robust evolutionary tree of skippers. The newly inferred phylogenetic tree resolves long-standing systematic issues and changes our understanding of the skipper tree of life. These resultsenhance understanding of the evolution of one of the most species-rich butterfly families.	[Toussaint, Emmanuel F.

Compared with isolines, development was delayed and survivorship reduced for P. interpunctella reared on grain from transgenic hybrids with the CaMV/35s promoter that express Cry1Ab protein. Similarly, compared with non-Bt hybrids, a transgenic hybrid with the CaMV/35s promoter that expresses Cry9C protein delayed development, decreased survivorship, and caused reductions in adult body length of P. interpunctella. In contrast, no significant differences in P. interpunctella developmental times or survivorship were observed between transgenic hybrids with the PEPC promoter expressing Cry1Ab and their isolines. Additionally, developmental rime, survivorship, and adult body length were similar between P. interpunctella reared on a transgenic hybrid with the CaMV/35s promoter expressing Cry1Ac and non-Bt hybrids. Our data demonstrate that transgenic Bt maize grain, especially grain from hybrids with the CaMV/35s promoter expressing Cry1Ab or Cry9C, can significantly affect B. thuringiensis-susceptible P. interpunctella populations up to 4 or 5 mo after harvest.

Assessment of Napier millet (Pennisetum purpureum x P. glaucum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) trap crops for the management of Chilo partellus on maize	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Chilo partellus; Napier millet; sorghum; maize; trap crop; oviposition; survival; push-pull system	STEM BORER; DAMAGE LEVELS; LEPIDOPTERA; OVIPOSITION; PYRALIDAE; SWINHOE; GRASS; ESTABLISHMENT; COLONIZATION; DISPERSAL	Two Napier millet (Pennisetum purpureum x P. glaucum) hybrids, namely PBN 83 and PBN 233 and one sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) variety, SL 44, were assessed for their potential role as a trap crop in the management of the stem borer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) on maize. Oviposition preference and larval survival and development were determined for different test plants under laboratory and screen house conditions. Further, field dispersal of C. partellus larvae was assessed between Napier millet and maize crops. Results from no-choice and dual-choice tests indicated that Napier millet hybrids were preferred for oviposition over maize by C. partellus moths. Sorghum was, however, not preferred over maize in this respect. Napier millet hybrids were poor larval hosts, and a rapid decline in larval numbers was noticed within the first five days after hatching and virtually no larvae survived to pupation. Leaf area eaten by the borer larvae was significantly less on these hybrids than on maize or sorghum. Plant damage was more severe in maize and sorghum than Napier millet hybrids. No appreciable larval shift was noticed from Napier millet hybrids to the adjoining maize crop. The evaluated Napier millet hybrids, therefore, had potential for use as trap crop in C. partellus management. Sorghum, however, did not hold promise in this respect,	[Hari, N.

To explain this situation, five hypotheses have been proposed. They were tested one by one in field trials. The authors have demonstrated that the main reason for stabilized yields was the Lepidoptera root pest Sufetula spp. and conclude by considering lines of research for controlling this pest in the context of rehabilitation and replanting.

Trade-Off Between Sensitivity and Specificity in the Cabbage Looper Moth Response to Sex Pheromone	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Evolutionary trade-off; Lepidoptera; Pheromone sensitivity; Speciation; Trichoplusia ni; Wind tunnel	PECTINOPHORA-GOSSYPIELLA LEPIDOPTERA; PINK-BOLLWORM MOTH; COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM; HERITABLE VARIATION; OLFACTORY RESPONSE; BLEND RATIOS; ALMOND MOTH; SELECTION; EVOLUTION; COMPONENTS	The evolution of male moth responses to pheromone blends may be constrained by a trade-off between two response traits: sensitivity and breadth of response. Population genetic simulations predict that if sensitivity and breadth of response are negatively correlated (i.e., a trade-off exists), then selection will favor males with narrow response phenotypes and high sensitivity. Although sensitivity-breadth of response trade-offs are generally assumed to exist and are implicit to the shape of male preference function, this study is the first to provide empirical support measuring behavior at the level of the individual. Previous studies with the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, have documented the existence of a mutant pheromone strain. While mutant females produce a pheromone blend significantly different from wild-type females, mutant males respond equally to the wild-type and mutant pheromone blends. This study used wind tunnel bioassays to document that relative to wild-type males, mutant males had broader response profiles but lower pheromone sensitivity. While wild-type male responses were highest to the wild-type pheromone blend, mutant males did not discriminate among pheromone blends. These results are consistent with a trade-off between breadth of response and sensitivity. Pure wild-type and mutant lines were crossed and hybrid males assayed. Both hybrid types (maternal wild-type and maternal mutant hybrids) responded similarly. Hybrid males had response profiles similar to wild-type males and the reduced sensitivity observed in mutant males. These results suggest a possible hybrid disadvantage and a putative mechanism for reinforcement of male pheromone response traits.

No field resistance to CEW was detected among the 27 commercial sweet com hybrids, yet 'Ashworth' possessed antibiotic silks. Larvae fed on silk diets of 'Ashworth' were smaller at 9 d, developmental time was longer, and the weight of resulting pupae was less than larvae fed on diets of silks of the other commercial hybrid. However, 'Ashworth' has a loose husk which renders it susceptible in the field. If the husk character could be changed from loose to tightly husked in one or both of the inbreds, a commercial sweet corn would be available to growers that has antibiotic resistance to the CEW in the field. Damage ratings were significantly correlated with husk tightness (r = -0.83) and developmental time of larvae (r = -0.47). Also, husk tightness was significantly correlated with developmental time of larvae (r = 0.62) and weight of pupa (r = -0.50).

The abundance, survival, and causes of mortality of Cameraria hamadryadella (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) were examined on four host plant species in Virginia, U.S.A. Quercus alba L. and Q.rubra L. are native within the geographic range of C.hamadryadella, and Q.robur L. and Q.benderi Baenitz are exotic. Q.robur is native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia and was probably introduced prior to 1850, and Q.benderi is of hybrid origin and introduced to cultivation before 1900. Q.alba and Q.robur are in the subgenus Lepidobalanus (white oaks), and Q.rubra and Q.benderi are in the subgenus Erythrobalanus (red oaks). 2. Larval mines of C.hamadryadella were abundant on both white oak species, including the exotic Q.robur, but were rare on host plants in the red oak subgenus. Un-hatched eggs of C.hamadryadella were not observed on red oaks. Other observations on host distribution indicate that C.hamadryadella is rarely found on red oaks. These observations are interpreted as circumstantial evidence that C.hamadryadella generally avoids ovipositing on red oaks. 3. Survival of C.hamadryadella to the adult stage was similar among all host species, but larvae tended to survive longer on hosts in the red oak subgenus. The observation of higher survival rates of early instar larvae on red oaks suggests that no nutritional or secondary chemical barrier reinforces the observed pattern of oviposition. 4. Significant differences in the distribution of the causes of mortality were detected between native and exotic host plant species. Larvae and pupae on native hosts were more likely to die because of predation, while those on exotic host plants were more likely to die because of parasitism and host feeding by adult female parasitoids. This pattern could arise because parasitoids prefer to forage on exotic host plants or because predators avoid foraging on exotic plants. 5. This study shows for C.hamadryadella that the only barriers to colonization and use of exotic hosts, in the white and red oak subgenera, are the presence of cues sufficient to stimulate oviposition and/or the absence of cues to deter oviposition. It also suggests that the presence of closely related native host plants in the region of introduction will increase the probability that exotic plants will be colonized by phytophagous insects.

Smith) resistance prebreeding and breeding programs in Zambia and related agro-ecologies. A line x tester mating design was used to generate 60 experimental hybrids. The hybrids and their parents were evaluated in the field in three FAW hotspot locations in Zambia. Both the general and specific combining ability effects were significant (p < 0.05) for the assessed traits. Non-additive genetic effects were more important for the inheritance of grain yield and FAW-inflicted leaf and cob damage, suggesting that heterosis breeding would be the best strategy for improving these traits in this population. The narrow sense heritability (h2) estimates for agronomic and FAW-related traits ranged from 0.14 to 0.47 and 0.37 to 0.49, respectively. The experimental hybrids CML346/EBL16469, ZM4236/ CML545-B, CML346/CZL1310c, CML334/EBL173782, CML545-B/EBL169550 were among those selected with favourable specific combining ability estimates for grain yield, days-to-50 % anthesis, days-to-50 % silking, FAW leaf and cob damage resistance, respectively. The selected experimental hybrids are recommended for further evaluation and breeding in Zambia or similar agro-ecologies.

The primary means of controlling CEW on corn is to use host plant resistance because chemical control is costly and inconsistent. The objective of this study was to identify new sources of CEW resistance genes from the Germplasm, Enhancement of Maize (GEM) germplasm with either 25% or 50% tropical background. Seventy-three GEM breeding crosses plus three check hybrids (Pioneer hybrids 3223 and 34K77 and B73 x Mo17) were evaluated in Lubbock, Texas in 1999 and 2000. Significant differences in ear penetration by larvae, ear length, ratio of ear penetration to ear length, and grain mold were found among the genotypes. Over the 2 years BVIR103:S04, DKXL380:S08a, DKB830:S19, GUAT209:N19, and CUBA117:S15 had the lowest CEW damage and may be new sources of CEW resistance. Grain mold was positively related to CEW damage. The breeding crosses with 50% tropical background had significantly lower CEW damage, less grain mold, and longer ears than those with 25% tropical background or the check hybrids.

We determined the cumulative, lethal and sublethal effects of Bt corn hybrids during the larval stages of Bt-resistant populations of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The susceptibility to Bt corn traits depended on the fall armyworm population and the developmental stage of the larvae. On Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab corn, neonate-to-adult survival rates of Cry1F-resistant larvae was 4% when the exposure started in the neonate and 87% when in late instars. Cry1F-resistant larvae feeding on Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab corn throughout larval development produced viable adults that successfully reproduced without any noticeable disadvantage. In contrast, Bt susceptible larvae had high mortality on Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab corn, and no adults emerged from the larvae exposed to the toxins, independently of the larval stage. Cry1Ab + Vip3Aa corn killed all larvae in any instar, regardless of the Bt-toxin resistance of the fall armyworm population. These results consistently indicate that Cry1F resistance reduces the susceptibility to Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab toxins and that Vip3Aa has a high potential to control field populations of Cry-toxin-resistant fall armyworm, even if there was plant-to-plant larval movement to Vip Bt plants in late instars in a scenario seed-mixture refuge. We discuss the implications of our findings for sustainable resistance management.

Bombyx mori pylorus infection by Alphabaculovirus	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Insect; Baculovirus; Lepidoptera; Hindgut	ANTICARSIA-GEMMATALIS HUBNER; NUCLEOPOLYHEDROVIRUS; LEPIDOPTERA; POLYHEDRIN; HINDGUT; GENES; CELLS; L.	Alphabaculovirus is an entomopathogenic virus genus that infects Bombyx mori, which is known as the Bombyx mori multiple nucleopolyedrovirus (BmMNPV). This virus is polyorganotrophic, and a series of tissues are known as targets; however, there is currently no information regarding infection in the pylorus, the segment of the hindgut that is present in the midgut transition and is responsible for food passage control. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to analyze infection of the B. mori pylorus by BmMNPV. To do so, hybrid B. mori larvae were inoculated with a viral suspension of BmMNPV, and segments of the intestine containing the pylorus and its subdivisions, the posterior interstitial ring (PIR), pyloric cone, and pyloric valve, were dissected and processed for light microscopy on different days post inoculation. The results showed that B. mori pylorus subdivisions respond differently to infection, and the anterior area of the PIR is susceptible with these cells being the secondary infection targets. Cytological analysis revealed the presence of viroplasm in the hypertrophic nucleus, followed by the formation and development of viral polyhedra. Cytolysis occurred at the end of the infectious cycle, thereby releasing polyhedra and enabling the spread of the disease. There was no evidence of BmMNPV infection in the posterior area of the PIR, cone, or pyloric valve.

Field work in Uganda and Sierra Leone in 1964-72 demonstrated a statistical association between the occurrence and relative frequencies of polymorphic forms in Danaus chrysippus (Danainae) and Acraea encedon (Acraeinae) which was deemed as confirmation of a Mullerian relationship between them. There were, however, certain anomalies which at the time remained unresolved. Later, in 1976, it was discovered that what had been called A. encedon is in reality two sibling species A. encedon and a new one, named as A. encedana The two differ in the structure of both male and female genitalia and in the coloration and the food-plants of the larvae. The recognition of the additional species has enabled a re-assessment of the polymorphic Mullerian association with D. chrysippus. It emerges that, although there is a close qualitative and quantitative reciprocal mimetic relationship between A. encedana and D. chrysippus, the relationship between A. encedon and D. chrysippus is much weaker, and in places non-existent. The possible origin of the mimetic polymorphism is discussed in terms of hybridization of previously allopatric and monomorphic populations which have met as a consequence of recent expansions of geographical range in all three species resulting from forest clearance and the spread of savanna-like conditions in previously forested areas.

Resistance of Citrus Genotypes to Phyllocnitis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae)	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Citrus leafminer; host plant; biology		The development and reproduction of the citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, were evaluated in six citrus genotypes in order to identify genotypes with resistance traits that could be applied in a program for the development of citrus varieties resistant to the citrus leafminer. Tests were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 70 +/- 10% RH, and 14h photophase). Seedlings of each genotype tested were infested with eggs obtained from a stock colony of CLM maintained on 'Cravo' lemon (Citrus limonia L. Osbeck), and the duration and survival of the eggs, larval and pupal stages, pupal size and weight, fecundity and longevity of adults, and sex ratio were evaluated. No influence was observed on the duration and survival of eggs, larvae and pupae of P. citrella. However, pupae obtained in the hybrid C x R-4 were significantly smaller and lighter than pupae from the remaining treatments. Adult females from the hybrids C x R-4 and C x R-315 were the least fecund. However, the lowest value for the corrected reproductive potential (CRP) was recorded in the hybrid C x R-315, suggesting that this genotype is the least favorable for the development and reproduction of CLM. On the other hand, the highest CRP value obtained in the 'Rugoso' lemon confirms the susceptibility of this genotype, indicating it as the most suitable for CLM.	[Santos, M. S.; Vendramim, J.

J	HAGEN, RH				HAGEN, RH			POPULATION-STRUCTURE AND HOST USE IN HYBRIDIZING SUBSPECIES OF PAPILIO-GLAUCUS (LEPIDOPTERA, PAPILIONIDAE)	EVOLUTION			English	Article								Two parapatric subspecies of the eastern tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio glaucus glaucus and P. g. canadensis, differ greatly in larval survival and growth on host plants in the Magnoliaceae, Salicaceae, and Betulaceae. In the first part of this study, butterflies were collected from 17 sites along a transect from Georgia to Quebec and used for allozyme electrophoresis. Two X- (or Z-)linked enzyme loci (Ldh and Pgd) showed allele frequency differences that delineated a hybrid zone between the subspecies in northern Pennsylvania and south-central New York. No significant linkage disequilibrium could be detected among allozyme loci within the hybrid zone samples. Genetic differentiation at Ldh and Pgd coincides with subspecies differences in diapause control and female mimicry, which are also sex-linked. Larval offspring of butterflies from 13 of the sites were then tested in the laboratory for survival and growth on Liriodendron tulipifera (Magnoliaceae), Populus deltoides (Salicaceae) and Betula lutea (Betulaceae). Steep clines in survival rates matched the position of the hybrid zone. Hybrid zone larvae showed intermediate survival rates and significant heterogeneity among families on all three plants, indicating presence of substantial genetic variation. The results suggest that differential host use by P. g. glaucus and P. g. canadensis is maintained primarily by independent clines in selection intensity for ability to use allopatric sets of host plants, coupled with restricted gene flow across the hybrid zone.

E. Smith), and corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie, perennially cause leaf and ear damage to corn for silage production in the southeastern United States. Transgenic hybrids expressing the Cry1Ab (MON810 event) insecticidal endotoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) were evaluated for management of fall armyworm and corn earworm in central Georgia during 2006 and 2007. Hybrids with a temperate or semitropical background were planted at the recommended time in mid-April and in late June to simulate a double-crop corn planting. Whorl infestation and damage by fall armyworm was significantly reduced in hybrids with the Bt trait when infestations were large. Fall armyworm infestation levels and damage were similar in both temperate and semitropical types. Hybrids with the Bt trait also had a small reduction in ear infestation and less kernel damage in ears infested by corn earworm than susceptible hybrids in most trials. Corn earworm infestation level were less in the semitropical than the temperate hybrids in 2006 but were not different in 2007. Silage yield was not significantly different among hybrids with and without the Bt trait in the first planting in both years. The Bt trait prevented significant yield loss of 17.1% during the second planting in 2006 when fall armyworm whorl infestations exceeded 39% in susceptible hybrids, but did not significantly affect silage yield in the late planting in 2007 when fall armyworm infestations were low. Temperate hybrids yielded more than semitropical hybrids in the early planting, but the semitropical type tended to perform better in the late planting. Corn silage quality as measured by neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and crude protein content did not differ among hybrids with or without the Bt trait indicating silage dry matter yield was the main silage component affected by the Bt trait and insect damage.

Heliconius butterflies display colorful patterns affecting mate choice and survival through warning signaling and mimicry. These patterns are called "magic traits" for speciation because divergent natural selection may promote mimicry shifts in pattern whose role as mating cue facilitates reproductive isolation. By contrast, between comimetic species, natural selection promotes pattern convergence. We addressed whether visual convergence interferes with reproductive isolation by testing for sexual isolation between two closely related species with similar patterns, H. timareta thelxinoe and H. melpomene amaryllis. Experiments with models confirmed visual attraction based on wing phenotype, leading to indiscriminate approach. Nevertheless, mate choice experiments showed assortative mating. Monitoring male behavior toward live females revealed asymmetry in male preference, H. melpomene males courting both species equally while H. timareta males strongly preferred conspecifics. Experiments with hybrid males suggested an important genetic component for such asymmetry. Behavioral observations support a key role for short-distance cues in determining male choice in H. timareta. Scents extracts from wings and genitalia revealed interspecific divergence in chemical signatures, and hybrid female scent composition was significantly associated with courtship intensity by H. timareta males, providing candidate chemical mating cues involved in sexual isolation.

In order to better understand the diversification of this endemic insular radiation, to unravel relationships among species and populations, and to get insight into the early stages of speciation, we developed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on the combined mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (555 bp) and II (453 bp), and the nuclear elongation factor-1 alpha (711 bp) and wingless (351 bp) genes. Monophyly of the genus is strongly supported in the Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses suggesting a single colonization event by a common ancestor. Two cases of paraphyly observed between species are hypothesized to represent imperfect species limits for G. espanolaensis nested within the G. turritella clade, and introgressive hybridization or lineage sorting in the case of the population of G. protozona from Santa Fe nested within the G. gnathodoxa clade. A geologically calibrated, relaxed molecular clock model was used for the first time to unravel the chronological sequence of an insular radiation. The first split occurring within the Galagete lineage on the archipelago is estimated at 3.3 +/- 0.4 million years ago. The genus radiated relatively quickly in about 1.8 million years, and gives an estimated speciation rate of 0.8 species per million years. Although the colonization scenario shows a stochastic dispersal pattern, the arrival of the ancestor and the diversification of the radiation coincide with the chronological emergence of the major islands.

E. Smith), were evaluated for resistance from seedling (V3) to pretassel (V14) vegetative stages. Expression of resistance was determined by comparing the growth and survivorship of fall armyworm larvae reared for 7 d on the resistant hybrids and on a susceptible hybrid (Ab24E x SC229). Larvae recovered from infested seedlings of the resistant hybrids weighed 43% less than those recovered from the susceptible hybrid. When plants were infested in the early-, mid-, and late-whorl stages (V6, V8, and V12, respectively) significantly fewer larvae or smaller larvae (or both) were obtained from the resistant hybrids than from the susceptible hybrid. However, when the plants were infested at pretassel stage of growth (V14), differences in larval growth and survivorship were smaller and more inconsistent. Differences in larval weight between resistant and susceptible hybrids were greater when plants were infested at earlier whorl stages. No consistent differences were found among plant growth stages within either resistant or susceptible hybrids for weight or survivorship.

UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Review						leaf mining insects; biological peculiarities; harmfulness; deciduous trees; horse chestnut; lime tree; black locust; green plantations		The authors present a general description of leaf mining insects of deciduous trees of green plantations. Biological peculiarities of adventitious leaf mining moth are highlighted. Their economic significance, biotic factors of decrease in population, tree species resistance to settlement by leaf mining insects, entomophagous of leaf mining moth are indicated. In particular, we have noted protection measures of trees from leaf mining insects. It is established that adventitious leaf mining moths from the order Lepidoptera (Lepidoptera) of the Gracillariidae family have recently spread in the green plantations of Ukraine: on horse chestnut - horse-chestnut leaf-miner Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic; on black locust - locust leaf-miner Parectopa robiniella Clemens and Phyllonorycter robiniella Clemens; on the lime tree - lime leaf-miner Phyllonorycter issikii Kumata. These noted leaf mining moths cause significant damage to plantations, manifested in the loss of decorative effect, decreased photosynthetic surface, and the weakening of trees. In the Kharkiv region, these species have spread over the past decade. Today, detailed studies of the peculiarities of their distribution and development have not been conducted. Among the measures to limit the number of leaf mining insects in urban environments, attention should be paid to resistant forms and hybrids, raking and composting fallen leaves, using pheromone traps, spraying crowns, and injecting insecticides into tree trunks.

Smith). These hybrids were prepared through a copper catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, known as a click reaction) and displayed larvicidal properties with LD50 values below 3 mg/g insect, and triazolyl-quinoline hybrid 6 showed an LD50 of 0.65 mg/g insect, making it 2 -fold less potent than methomyl, which was used as a reference insecticide (LD (50)= 0.34 mg/g insect). Compound 4 was the most active antifeedant derivative (CE50 = 162.1 mu g/mL) with a good antifeedant index (56-79%) at concentrations of 250-1000 mu g/mL. Additionally, triazolyl-quinoline hybrids 4-8 exhibited weak inhibitory activity against commercial acetylcholinesterase from Electrophorus electricus (electric -eel ACNE) (IC50 = 27.7 mu g/mL) as well as low anti-ChE activity on S. frugiperda larvae homogenate (IC50 = 68.4 mu g/mL). Finally, molecular docking simulations suggested that hybrid 7 binds to the catalytic active site (CAS) of this enzyme and around the rim of the enzyme cavity, acting as a mixed (competitive and noncompetitive) inhibitor like methomyl. Triazolyl-quinolines 4-6 and 8 inhibit AChE by binding over the perimeter of the enzyme cavity, functioning as noncompetitive inhibitors. The results described in this work can help to identify lead triazole structures from click chemistry for the development of insecticide and deterrent products against S. frugiperda and related insect pests.

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae); however, there is no information about performance of commercial cultivars for this pest attack. The aim of the present research was to identify maize cultivars less damaged by the fall armyworm under field conditions, which could be used as an additional tool for managing the pest in areas with history of high infestations, as well as for genetic breeding programs. The experiments were accomplished during the summer season 2006/2007 and 2007/2008; and off-season 2007, in Capao Bonito (SP), Coroados (SP) e Tatui (SP). Two experiments were set up in each area, one with simple and triple hybrids (HST) and other with double hybrids and varieties (HDV). The experimental design was in randomized blocks, with three and four replications for HST and HDV, respectively. The leaf injury caused by fall armyworm under natural infestation was evaluated using a rating scale ranging from 1 to 10. There were significant differences among cultivars for leaf injury, with the cultivars DKB 390 (simple hybrid) and DKB 979 (triple hybrid) being less damaged. These cultivars may serve as potential sources of resistance against the fall armyworm.

Three EAD-active components were found in crude pheromone gland extracts of calling females. GC/MS and GC analyses using synthetic chemicals and derivatization of the extracts identified three components as (10E,12Z)-hexadeca-10,12-dienal (E10,Z12-16:Ald,), (10E,12E)-hexadeca-10,12-dienyl acetate (E10,Z12-16:OAc), and (3Z,6Z,9Z)-tricosa-3,6,9-triene (Z3,Z6,Z9-23:HC). In field tests, male moths were strongly attracted to a ternary blend of E10,Z12-16:Ald, E10,Z12-16:OAc, and Z3,Z6,Z9-23:HC at a ratio of 1:5:14, but single and binary blends showed only weak or no attraction.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of transgenic (Bt) and conventional (non-Bt) hybrids in the control of fall armyworm, treated or not with insecticides throughout three late growing seasons. To this end, trials were conducted at three locations in the state of Sao Paulo, in a randomized complete block design, in factorial arrangements with 5x4, 5x4 and 8x4 factors, respectively. The first factor consisted of the number of commercial hybrids of different companies. The second factor was represented by the different control managements of insect (non-Bt hybrid with and without insecticide; Bt hybrid with and without insecticide). The damage caused by fall armyworm was evaluated on a visual 1-9 scale, from score 0 (no damage) to 9 (totally destroyed whorl), and grain yield (kg ha(-1)). The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and the means compared by the Tukey test at 5% probability for each parameter evaluated at each location. For the Bt hybrids, the damage scores attributed to fall armyworm were lower and the proteins Cry 1F, Cry 1A105 and VIP3Aa20 were the most efficient in reducing leaf damage. Insecticide applications proved efficient in reducing leaf damage caused by the pest. Application of insecticides to Bt hybrids generally reduced leaf damage, especially for Cry1Ab-producing hybrids, which were the least effective in reducing pest damage without insecticides.

Plants were damaged at the V3 and V5 stages of corn development. The experiment was conducted on 2 corn hybrids. Pioneer 3921 and Pioneer 3733, planted at 6.0 and 8.0 plants per square meter, in 1993 and 1994. A significant year effect on both grain and silage yield was detected. In both years of study, hybrid had a significant effect on grain yield but not on silage yield, whereas plant density had no significant effect on grain and silage whole-crop yields. Significant linear and quadratic relationships between both grain and silage yields and damage level were detected. Grain yield losses, averaged across plant density, varied from 0 to 24% and 0 to 81% when plants were damaged at the V3 and V5 stages of corn development respectively, depending on hybrid, damage level, and year. For P3733, maximum grain loss exceeded silage loss by as much as 9 and 14% in 1993 and 1994, respectively. P3921 grain losses paralleled silage losses in both years. A phenological delay associated with the simulated damage was observed.

Maize plants were planted in late April or early May, mid-May and early June during each year. The moth flight pattern showed bivoltine generations during the three years. The first moth flight peaked in June, with the populations declining during July. The second moth flight peaked in August and declined towards the end of September or early October. Egg mass density did not differ significantly between transgenic and non-transgenic maize of different maturities. Significant differences were observed, however, among planting dates, sampling dates, and sampling date x planting date interactions. Generally higher numbers of egg masses from second generation moths were deposited on late planted maize than middle and early plantings.

Farooq			Effect of Rearing Temperature and Humidity on Fecundity and Fertility of Silkworm, Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae)	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Silkworm; fecundity; fertility; silk seed		The effect of temperature and humidity fluctuations on fecundity and fertility of the silkworm lines was investigated during autumn and spring by exposing 4(th) and 5(th) instar larvae of eleven inbred silkworm lines (M-101, M-103, M-104, M-107, Pak-1, Pak-2, Pak-3, Pak-4, PFI-1, PFI-2 and S-1) to 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 30 +/- 1 degrees C and 35 +/- 1 degrees C in combination with 55, 65 and 75% relative humidity (RH) for 3hr daily. Temperature and relative humidity during larval rearing affected the fecundity and fertility of inbred silkworm lines adversely. The maximum average number of eggs were laid at 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 75 +/- 5% RH (413.1) followed by 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 75% RH (400.4) and 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 65% RH (390.9). Significant difference in egg fertility was observed between all the treatments. Maximum average fertilized eggs were recorded at 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 75 +/- 5% RH (88.77) followed by 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 75% RH (86.88) and 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 65% RH (85.09) while lowest fertility was shown by 35 +/- 1 degrees C with 55% RH (67.52). The deleterious effect of temperature and humidity was observed on fecundity and fertility of inbred silkworm lines. Pak-4 was the best performer with maximum eggs (471.5) at 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 75 +/- 5% RH followed by PFI-1 (465.2) and M-101(464.1) in the same environment. The best temperature and humidity for rearing silkworm lines for seed cocoon production (to obtain higher number of eggs per moth with increased fertility) is 25 +/- 1 degrees C with 75 +/- 5% RH. Pak-2, Pak-4, Pak-3 and PFI-I were the better lines which may be utilized in seed cocoon production and hybridization. Investigations elucidated that temperature and humidity variations during larval rearing resulted in low fecundity and high incidence of unfertilized eggs.

Ovipositional antixenosis to Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton in Citrus genotypes and related genera	PHYTOPARASITICA			English	Article						Citrus leaf miner; Insect-plant interaction; Host selection; Citrusspp; Poncirus trifoliata	LEPIDOPTERA; PERFORMANCE; RESISTANCE; PREFERENCE	This study evaluated oviposition of citrus leaf miner (CLM),Phyllocnistis citrellaStainton (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), in differentCitrusgenotypes and related genera to search for resistance sources of type antixenosis or no preference for oviposition. Initially, we screened 23 genotypes and we used lime 'Rugoso' (Citrus jambhiriLush.) as the susceptibility standard. Based on the number of eggs and pupae found on the plants, five genotypes were most promising to significantly reduce pest population: trifoliata 'Limeira' (Poncirus trifoliata), hybrids M x P-222[Citrus sinensisx Tangor Murcott (Citrus sinensisxC. reticulata)], C x R-4(Citrus sunkixP. trifoliata) and C x R-315(C. sunkixP. trifoliata) and tangerine 'Sunki' (C. sunki). In the preference test for oviposition with choice, trifoliata 'Limeira' and hybrid C x R(315)were the least preferred genotypes by CLM, while in the no choice test, the effect of the genotypes was less evident, with a difference only between trifoliata 'Limeira' (less oviposited) and lime 'Rugoso' (more oviposited). Thus, trifoliata 'Limeira' and hybrid C x R(315)are potential sources of antixenosis resistance and could be used in breeding programs to incorporate CLM resistance factors in improved genotypes.

They were used to detect their efficacy against 3 species of poplar defoliators: forest tent capterpillar, Malacosoma disstria Hubner, gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar Linnaeus and willow moth, Stilpnotia candida Staudinger by using detached leaves and for the purpose of identifying the CpTI gene at the molecular level. Foliage of transgenic poplars elicited an increase in larval mortality rate and a decrease in foliage consumption, wet weight gains, faeces excretion, deposited pupae number and pupae weight, thus indicating its effectiveness in affecting the growth, development and fecundity of larvae rather than only directly killing them. PCR and Southern blotting analyses confirmed the stable incorporation of CpTI gene while proteinase inhibitory assays disclosed its high level expression in the two-field-season of transgenic trees. Efficacious insect resistance and higher content of CpTI in foliage were found in transgenic clone TG04, TG07, TG08 and TG71, demonstrating a correspondence between the insect resistance level and the CpTI content in the foliage of transgenic poplar.

During the 2017 spring-summer crop season, insects were collected on 10 genetically modified (GM) hybrids of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), planted at "Rincan del Buitre" ranch, belonging to "Universidad Autonoma Agraria Antonio Narro" (UAAAN) at San Pedro, Coahuila, Mexico. The 13,422 phytophagous insects collected from GM cotton were in five orders: Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and Thysanoptera; approximate to 12,766 of the individual insects were in Hemiptera, mainly whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), for a total of 657 other insects collected. Coleoptera were 18.5% of the families, 19.4% of species, and 6.6% of individuals; Diptera had 29.6, 27.8, and 17.2%, respectively; Hemiptera (without Aleyrodidae) had 25.9, 27.8, and 18.9%, respectively; Lepidoptera had 18.5, 19.4, and 44.6%, respectively, and Thysanoptera had 3.7, 2.8, and 2.5%, respectively. Species with more individuals than 5% of the total were Anagasta kuehniella Zeller (32.7%), Spodoptera exigua HObner (11.0%), Epichlorops sp. Becker (10.7%), Lygus oblineatus Say (9.0%), Diabrotica balteata Leconte (6.9%), Anthonomus grandis Boheman (5.9%), and Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (approximate to 12,766 individuals). Species with greatest incidence among cotton hybrids were Epichlorops sp. (70%), L. oblineatus and D. balteata (each 60%), and A. grandis and Aphis gossypii Glover (each 30%). Monitoring increasing abundance of secondary pests on Bt crops can indicate if the pests threaten sustainable production of the crop.

Two fields, one of them adjacent to an apiary with 40 hives, were sampled weekly for two months. A total of fifteen species of insect pollinators were recorded. Species of the order Hymenoptera were the most abundant (91%), followed by those of Lepidoptera (6%) and Diptera (3%). The relative abundance of four Apis species, i.e. Apis mellifera, A. dorsata, A. cerana and A. florea, varied on hourly and weekly basis. The peak densities of all honeybee species were recorded at 12.00 pm and 02:00 pm while minimum densities were recorded at 08:00 am and 04:00 pm. Apis mellifera was the most recorded honeybee species compared to other Apis spp. during the study. In both fields the differences were significant.

Specific detection of cryI- and cryIV-type genes was performed in a polymerase chain reaction using cryI and cryIV-specific oligonucleotide primers. The cry-type genes under study consisted of cryIA(a), cryI(A)b, cryI(A)c, cryIB, and cryIV. Presence or absence of the cryI- and cryIV-type genes was further confirmed by Southern blotting followed by hybridization with specific cryI and cryIV gene fragments. A genetically modified strain of B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-I, called OZK-13 and obtained following mutagenesis with ozone, was shown to contain cryIA(a), cryIA(b), and cryIA(c) genes. Another kurstaki HD-1 mutant, called NGK-13 and obtained following treatment with N-methyl-N-1 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), was shown to have lost the cryIA(b) gene while retaining the cryIA(a) and cryIA(c) genes. NGI-23-1, an oligosporogenous-multicrystalliferous mutant of B. thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) HD-500, obtained following treatment with MNNG contained cryIV-type genes. NGI-22, an oligosporogenous -acrystalliferous mutant of Bti HD-500, contained no cryI- nor cryIV-type genes. The rice grain dust isolate BT-285 contained the cryIA(a) and cryIA((c) genes. Isolate BT-14 contained only the cryIA(c) gene, whereas isolate BT-209 contained cryIA(a), cryIA(b), and cryIB genes. Isolate BT-205 contained no cryI- nor cryIV-type genes. Bacillus thuringiensis mutants and natural isolates shown to contain cryI-type genes were tested for their insecticidal activities in a series of bioassays against Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). All cryI-carrying strains were toxic against the insect larvae. BT-205 was also tested and exhibited no toxicity against the insect larvae.

Cheimas opalinus (Staudinger), endemic to the Venezuelan Cordillera de Merida, and considered prior to this study to be monotypic and restricted to the central part of the range, is demonstrated to be polytypic and more widely distributed. Five subspecies are recognised, differing mostly in their dorsal patterns, in particular the shape and colour of hindwing greenish-blue patch. Mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI) were obtained for three of them. The nominate subspecies is found in the central part of the range, in the Sierra Nevada and La Culata. The other subspecies are found as follows: C. opalinus dominici n. ssp.; in the Santo Do-mingo valley in the centre-north; C. opalinus cristalinus n. ssp. in the north; C. opalinus iosephi n. ssp. on the eastern slopes, and C. opalinus rosalinus n. ssp. in the southern Paramo El Batallon massif. A hybrid zone between the latter two subspecies was detected in the northern part of the Batallon massif based on unusual individual variation and intermediate phenotypes. All the populations of Cheimas opalinus occur in the forest-paramo ecotone at 2800-3400 m a.s.l., with the notable exception of C. opalinus cristalinus n. ssp. found also in mid-elevation forests down to 2300 m a.s.l.

Does Singular and Stacked Corn Affect Choice Behavior for Oviposition and Feed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)?	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Transgenic crops; reproductive performance; fall armyworm; insect-plant interaction	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; GENERALIST HERBIVORE; PLANT VOLATILES; BT MAIZE; PERFORMANCE; RESISTANCE; PREFERENCE; CONSEQUENCES; CANNIBALISM; ATTRACTION	Little is known about the effects of genetically modified corn plants on the foraging of Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith). Therefore, this study examines whether singular herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant plants and their stacked events interfere with food preference and oviposition of S. frugiperda. Two non-Bt corn hybrids and three Bt-hybrids, some of them with glyphosate tolerance (GT), were evaluated. Food preference of larvae and biological parameters were assessed. Oviposition preference bioassays involved choice and no choice condition in plants uninfested and previously infested by larvae in a greenhouse and in the field. The results indicate that there is no relationship between preference of larvae and adult moths. Adult females selected preferentially transgenic hybrids, while larvae selected non-Bt hybrid. Fall armyworm larvae avoid Bt-toxin-expressing leaf tissues, survived only on the non-Bt leaf tissues, and showed minor differences in other life-history traits reared on GT and non-transgenic corn leaf tissues. Female moths showed preference for transgenic plants to lay eggs, but with variable output between previously infested and uninfested plants with larvae. The fact that moths preferred Ag 3700RR2 and non-Bt hybrids for oviposition supports the refuge's strategy aiming at producing susceptible individuals. The use of this hybrid must be integrated with a program of control. The results showed also the importance of correct hybrid selection as part of insect resistance management to Bt-plants. The implications of these findings for understanding the impacts of plant-mediated cues on pest behavior in transgenic crop systems are discussed.	[Nascimento, P. T.; Von Pinho, R. G.; Souza, C. S.

DNA barcoding of the leaf-mining moth subgenus Ectoedemia s. str. (Lepidoptera: Nepticulidae) with COI and EF1-alpha: two are better than one in recognising cryptic species	CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY			English	Article						pairwise difference; Palearctic	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; PLANT MEALS; IDENTIFICATION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMATICS; GEOMETRIDAE; MORPHOLOGY; DISPERSAL; INVENTORY; EVOLUTION	We sequenced 665bp of the Cytochrome C Oxidase I (COI) barcoding marker for 257 specimens and 482bp of Elongation Factor 1-alpha. (EF1-alpha) for 237 specimens belonging to the leaf-mining subgenus Ectoedemia (Ectoedemia) in the basal Lepidopteran family Nepticulidae. The dataset includes 45 out of 48 West Palearctic Ectoedemia s. str. species and several species from Africa, North America and Asia. Both COI and EF1-alpha proved reliable as an alternative to conventional species identification for the majority of species and the combination of both markers can aid in species validation. A clear barcode gap is not present, and in some species large K2P intraspecific pairwise differences are found, up to 6.85% in COI and 2.9% in EF1-alpha. In the Ectoedemia rubivora species complex, the species E. rubivora. E. arcuatella and E. atricollis share COI barcodes and could only be distinguished by EF1-alpha. Diagnostic base positions, usually third codon positions, are in this and other cases a useful addition to species delimitation, in addition to distance methods. Ectoedemia albifasciella COI barcodes fall into two distinct clusters not related to other characters, whereas these clusters are absent in EF1-alpha, possibly caused by mtDNA anomalies or hybridisation. In the Ectoedemia subbimaculella complex, both sequences fail to unequivocally distinguish the species E. heringi. E. liechtensteini. E. phyllotomella and one population of E. subbimaculella. DNA barcodes confirm that North American Ectoedemia argyropeza are derived from a European introduction. We strongly advocate the use of a nuclear marker in addition to the universal COI barcode marker for better identifying species, including cryptic ones.

Morphology of the Pylorus of Bombyx mori (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae)	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Hindgut; posterior interstitial ring; pyloric cone; pyloric valve; spicules	HISTOLOGY; HINDGUT	The pylorus is a segment of the hindgut of great morphological diversity, which is subdivided into the posterior interstitial ring, pyloric cone, and pyloric valve. There is no morphological information on Bombyx mori (L.) hybrids, which is an insect of economic interest to Brazil. Consequently, this study aimed to analyze the morphology of the pylorus of hybrid larvae of fifth instars of B. mori from crossbreeding of Chinese and Japanese races. These were anesthetized, and the pylorus was fixed and processed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The pylorus presented as a separate compartment, consisting of a simple epithelium, with large variation in cell morphology, covered on the luminal side by an intima with specializations in some areas, the spicules. The musculature was formed by bundles of striated muscle fibers in longitudinal and circular arrangement. These fibers were multinucleated with central and peripheral nuclei, operating in peristalsis. The morphology of the pylorus is a reflection of functional dynamism, and this study provided a better understanding of its physiology, which promotes the regulated movement of the bolus, preventing reflux and directing it towards the ileum in the formation of fecal pellets.

Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the impact that corn (Zea mays L.) kernels (i.e., grain) of some Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) corn hybrids containing CrylAb Bt delta -endotoxin have oil life history) attributes of Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth. Stored grain is at risk to damage from Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth; therefore, Bt corn may provide a means of protecting this commodity from damage. Thus, the objective of this research was to quantify the effects of transgenic corn seed containing CrylAb delta -endotoxin on Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth survival, fecundity, and duration of development. Experiments with Bt grain, non-Bt isolines, and non-Bt grain were conducted in environmental chambers at 27 +/- 1 degreesC and greater than or equal to 60% RH in continuous dark. Fifty eggs were placed in ventilated pint jars containing 170 g of cracked or whole corn for the Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth, respectively. Emergence and fecundity were observed for 5 wk. Emergence and fecundity of Indian meal moth and emergence of Angoumois grain moth were significantly lower for individuals reared on P33V08 anti N6800Bt, MON 810 and Bt-11 transformed hybrids, respectively, than on their non-Bt transformed isolines. Longer developmental times were observed for Indian meal moth reared on P33V08 and N600Bt than their non-Bt-transformed isolines. These results indicate that MON 810 and Bt-11 CrylAb delta -endotoxin-containing kernels reduce laboratory populations of Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth. Thus, storing Bt-transformed grain is a management tactic that warrants bill scale testing and may effectively reduce Indian meal moth and Angoumois grain moth populations in grain without application of synthetic chemicals or pesticides.

Heliconius butterflies, well known for their diversity of wing color patterns, mate assortatively as a result of divergence in male preference for wing patterns. Here we show that the specific cue used by Heliconius cydno and Heliconius pachinus males to recognize conspecific females is the color of patches on the wings. in addition, male mate preference segregates with forewing color in hybrids, indicating a genetic association between the loci responsible for preference and preference cue. Quantitative trait locus mapping places a preference locus coincident with the locus that determines forewing color, which itself is perfectly linked to the wing patterning candidate gene, wingless. Furthermore, yellow-colored males of the polymorphic race H. cydno alithea prefer to court yellow females, indicating that wing color and color preference are controlled by loci that are located in an inversion or are pleiotropic effects of a single locus. Tight genetic associations between preference and preference cue, although rare, make divergence and speciation particularly likely because the effects of natural and sexual selection on one trait are transferred to the other, leading to the coordinated evolution of mate recognition. This effect of linkage on divergence is especially important in Heliconius because differentiation of wing color patterns in the genus has been driven and maintained by natural selection for Mullerian mimicry.

COMPARATIVE GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION; BOMBYX-MORI; SYNAPTONEMAL COMPLEXES; W-CHROMOSOME; MALE MEIOSIS; DROSOPHILA; DIFFERENTIATION; CHROMATIN; FEMALE; MOTHS	The physical basis of non-Mendelian segregation of a sex-linked marker was studied in sex-chromosome mutant females of eight ASF ('abnormal segregating females') lines in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. Electron microscopical analysis of microspread synaptonemal complexes revealed that in one line, the Z chromosome segment that contained the dz(+) allele was translocated onto an autosome. The resulting quadrivalent visible in early female meiosis was 'corrected' into two bivalents in later stages. This explains autosomal inheritance of the sex chromosome marker in this strain. In the other seven ASF lines, the type of meiotic pairing of an additional fragment (Z(dz+)) of the Z chromosome was responsible for abnormal segregation of the marker gene. In several of these lines, Z(dz+) contained a piece of the W chromosome in addition to the Z segment, as was confirmed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Z(dz+) formed three alternative pairing configurations with the original sex chromosomes: (i) a WZZ(dz+) trivalent, (ii) a WZ bivalent and a Z(dz+) univalent or (iii) a ZZ(dz+) bivalent and a W univalent. In the most frequent WZZ(dz+) configuration, Z(dz+) synapsed with Z and, consequently, segregated with W, simulating W linkage. This explains the predominant occurrence of the parental phenotypes in the progeny. Z(dz+) univalents or W univalents, on the other hand, segregated randomly, resulting in both parental and nonparental phenotypes. In two of these lines, the Z(dz+) was transmitted only to females. The results suggest that the W chromosome segment in Z(dz+) of these lines contains a male-killing factor which makes it incompatible with male development. Our data provide direct evidence for the regular transmission of radiation-induced fragments from lepidopteran chromosomes through more than 50 generations. This is facilitated by the holokinetic nature of lepidopteran chromosomes. We conclude that Z(dz+) fragments may persist as long as they possess active kinetochore elements.

As the model insect of Lepidoptera, Bombyx mori is an ideal material to carry out heterosis research. In current study, we employed proteomic and genetic cross approaches to globally identify differentially expressed proteins in parental silkworms JingSong and HaoYue and their F-1 hybrids. The results showed that there were significant differences between hybrids and their parents. In all, 28 differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified through MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry and database searches. Interestingly, three silk-related proteins were also obtained and identified, including fibroin L-chain, Nd-sD mutant fibroin light chain and fibrohexamerin, which were further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Consistent trends were also found in other genes. Taken together, our work not only provides the theoretical basis for the study of molecular mechanism of heterosis, but also provides candidate proteins and genes for the improvement of yield of silkworm.

E. Smith). GH-0937 (Bt+), Bonus (Bt-), and Silver Queen (Bt-) sweet corn hybrids were planted 15 April, 1 May, 15 May, 1 June, and 15 June 1997 to provide different intensities of insect pressure as populations increased during the season. During ear development, methomyl was applied in 0, 1, 3, or 5 applications beginning when 50% of the plants were silking. GH-0937 exhibited a high level of resistance to leaf feeding in the whorl stage by fall armyworm and to ear injury by the corn earworm and fall armyworm. With extreme insect pressure on plants for the 15 June planting, as evidenced by the extensive damage to Bonus and Silver Queen in the whorl stage, injury to ears of GH-0937 averaged only 7.9 cm(2) of kernel damage when no insecticide was applied, and was reduced to an average of only 1.7 cm(2) of kernel damage with 5 applications of methomyl. In this same test, Silver Queen and Bonus averaged 323 and 168 cm(2) of kernel damage, respectively, with no insecticide applications, and 172 and 50 cm(2), respectively, with 5 applications of methomyl. Injury to ears on GH-0937 was not eliminated, but was minimal and confined to a few kernels at the ear tip. Most of the observed injury was From feeding by nitidulid beetles, or to an occasional large fall armyworm larva that migrated from a susceptible plant to an untreated ear of GH-0937 where it fed before trying. Bt sweet corn offers an excellent opportunity to develop more environmentally compatible approaches for sweet corn production.

Four hundred shades of brown: Higher level phylogeny of the problematic Euptychiina (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Satyrinae) based on hybrid enrichment data	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Butterflies; Neotropics; Phylogenomics; Papilionoidea; Target enrichment	SPECIES TREE ESTIMATION; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; AMAZON BASIN; BUTTERFLIES; HUBNER; GENUS; SYSTEMATICS; FORSTER; REVISION; TAXA	Relationships within satyrine butterflies have been notoriously difficult to resolve using both morphology and Sanger sequencing methods, and this is particularly true for the mainly Neotropical subtribe Euptychiina, which contains about 400 described species. Known larvae of Euptychiina feed on grasses and sedges, with the exception of the genus Euptychia, which feed on mosses and lycopsids, and the butterflies occur widely in rainforest, cloudforest and grassland habitats, where they are often abundant. Several previous molecular and morphological studies have made significant progress in tackling the systematics of the group, but many relationships remain unresolved, with long-branch-attraction artifacts being a major problem. Additionally, the monophyly of the clade remains uncertain, with Euptychia possibly not being closely related to the remainder of the clade. Here we present a backbone phylogeny of the subtribe based on 106 taxa, 368 nuclear loci, and over 180,000 bps obtained through hybrid enrichment. Using both concatenation and species tree approaches (IQ-TREE, EXABAYES, ASTRAL), we can for the first time strongly confirm the monophyly of Euptychiina with Euptychia being the sister group to the remainder of the clade. The Euptychiina is divided into nine well supported clades, but the placement of a few genera such as Hermeuptychia, Pindis and the Chloreuptychia catharina group still remain uncertain. As partially indicated in previous studies, the genera Cissia, Chloreuptychia, Magneuptychia, Megisto, Splendeuptychia and Euptychoides, among others, were found to be highly polyphyletic and revisions are in preparation. The phylogeny will provide a strong backbone for the analysis of datasets in development that are much more taxonomically comprehensive but have orders of magnitude fewer loci. This study therefore represents a critical step towards resolving the higher classification and studying the evolution of this highly diverse lineage.

Microarray analysis and further characterization of large-scale changes in herbivore-induced mRNAs	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							DNA-BINDING PROTEINS; GENE-EXPRESSION; JASMONIC ACID; SERINE-CARBOXYPEPTIDASE; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; SESQUITERPENE CYCLASE; INDUCED RESPONSES; METHYL JASMONATE; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; CDNA CLONING	We extend our analysis of the transcriptional reorganization that occurs when the native tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, is attacked by Manduca sexta larvae by cloning 115 transcripts by mRNA differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and subtractive hybridization using magnetic beads (SHMB) from the M. sexta-responsive transcriptome. These transcripts were spotted as cDNA with eight others, previously confirmed to be differentially regulated by northern analysis on glass slide microarrays, and hybridized with Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes derived from plants after 2, 6, 12, and 24 h of continuous attack. Microarray analysis proved to be a powerful means of verifying differential expression; 73 of the cloned genes (63%) were differentially regulated (in equal proportions from differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SHMB procedures), and of these, 24 (32%) had similarity to known genes or putative proteins (more from SHMB). The analysis provided insights into the signaling and transcriptional basis of direct and indirect defenses used against herbivores, suggesting simultaneous activation of salicylic acid-, ethylene-, cytokinin-, WRKY-, MYB-, and oxylipin-signaling pathways and implicating terpenoid-, pathogen-, and cell wall-related transcripts in defense responses. These defense responses require resources that could be made available by decreases in four photosynthetic-related transcripts, increases in transcripts associated with protein and nucleotide turnover, and increases in transcripts associated with carbohydrate metabolism. This putative up-regulation of defense-associated and down-regulation of growth-associated transcripts occur against a backdrop of altered transcripts for RNA-binding proteins, putative ATP/ADP translocators, chaperonins, histones, and water channel proteins, responses consistent with a major metabolic reconfiguration that underscores the complexity of response to herbivore attack.

A new target capture phylogeny elucidates the systematics and evolution of wing coupling in sack-bearer moths	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							FEMALE FRENULUM; LEPIDOPTERA; MIMALLONIDAE; MIMALLONOIDEA; REVISION; GENUS; BOMBYCOIDEA; SEQUENCE; SCHAUS; GENERA	The frenulum is a wing coupling structure that is found on the wings of most families of Lepidoptera. It is a single bristle or set of bristles that originate from the base of the hindwing that often interlocks with the forewing during flight. This wing coupling mechanism is thought to have been a major evolutionary innovation that allowed for enhanced flight in Lepidoptera. The sack-bearer moths (Mimallonidae) are unusual among Lepidoptera in that not all species within the family have a frenulum. We test the hypothesis that the frenulum is not necessary and is therefore lost in mimallonids that have longer male forewings, because such wings are perhaps better suited to be coupled by other means. To understand the evolution of the frenulum, we inferred the most taxonomically and genetically sampled anchored hybrid enrichment-based phylogeny of Mimallonidae, including 604 loci from all 41 genera and from 120 species, covering about 40% of the described species in the family. The maximum likelihood tree robustly supports major relationships within the family, and ancestral state reconstruction clearly recovers the frenulum as the plesiomorphic condition in Mimallonidae. Our results show that the frenulum is more often observed in species that have shorter, rather than longer, male forewings. The frenulum has historically been used as an important character for intrafamilial classification in Mimallonidae, but our results conclusively show that this character system is more variable than previously thought. Based on our results, we erect two new subfamilies, Roelofinae St Laurent & Kawahara, subfam.n. and Meneviinae St Laurent, Herbin, & Kawahara, subfam.n., for four genera previously considered incertae sedis. In the predominantly frenulum-lacking clade Cicinninae, we describe a new genus, Cerradocinnus St Laurent, Mielke, & Kawahara, gen.n., and the genus Gonogramma stat. rev. is revalidated to include many species previously placed in Cicinnus sensu lato. With these changes, Cicinnus can now be considered monophyletic. Thirty-three species are transferred to Gonogramma from Cicinnus sensu lato. This published work has been registered on Zoobank, .

J	Sheck, AL; Gould, F				Sheck, AL; Gould, F			The genetic basis of differences in growth and behavior of specialist and generalist herbivore species: Selection on hybrids of Heliothis virescens and Heliothis subflexa (Lepidoptera)	EVOLUTION			English	Article						diet breadth; host range; monophagous; performance; polyphagous; preference	HOST; EVOLUTION; STERILITY; CHRYSOMELIDAE; RESISTANCE; COLEOPTERA; PREFERENCE; ADAPTATION	Two species of moths and their hybrids were studied to determine the genetic basis of host range. One species, Heliothis virescens (HV), has a broad host range and is an agricultural pest on cotton (Malvaceae), soybean (Fabaceae), and tobacco (Solanaceae). The other species, Heliothis subflexa (HS), has a narrow host range, feeding on plants in the genus Physalis (Solanaceae). Experiments were done to determine whether the abilities to feed on cotton, soybean, and tobacco were each under separate genetic control in HV (generically uncorrelated) or whether feeding on all three hosts was genetically correlated. By repeatedly backcrossing hybrids to HS while selecting for high larval survival and weight on soybean, loci conferring the ability to feed on soybean were moved from HV into the genetic background of the specialist, HS. After six generations of selection on soybean we tested the selected line on soybean, cotton, Physalis, and tobacco to determine if ability to feed on soybean was correlated with feeding ability on these other hosts. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that feeding on all three hosts was correlated and controlled by a single locus. Compared to HS, the survival and weight of the selected line were significantly higher on soybean, similar on tobacco and Physalis, and slightly, but not significantly, higher on cotton. We also conducted a behavioral choice test to determine if larval preference for soybean was correlated with preference for other hosts. The selected line larvae had higher preference for soybean and cotton than HS. Preference for tobacco was equal in the selected line and in HS. These results support the trends seen in survival and growth tests where performances on soybean and cotton appeared partially correlated and performances on soybean and tobacco were uncorrelated. In conclusion, the generalist, HV, did not have a single set of loci that governed feeding on soybean, cotton and tobacco. It is likely that some of the loci governing performance and preference for soybean also contributed to performance and preference for cotton and that the soybean loci examined did not interact negatively to lower performance and preference for Physalis, the specialist's host. This approach can be applied more widely to address evolutionary questions about host range and other ecological traits.

First results on synchrony between seasonal pattern of pheromone trap captures of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera and appearance of freshly emerged larvae on developing cobs of corn hybrids	JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE			English	Article						Zea mays; Helicoverpa armigera; captures; Noctuidae; hatch of larvae; timing of pesticide application	FEMALE SEX-PHEROMONE; HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; HELIOTHIS-ARMIGERA; NOCTUIDAE; RESISTANCE	Synchrony between development of five corn hybrid varieties of various seasonal growing rates (FAO numbers), seasonal flight pattern of male cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hb. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), as monitored by pheromone traps, and the subsequent appearance of newly hatched larvae on developing cobs were studied at Mezohegyes, South-Hungary, in 2003 and 2004. The phenological stages of corn hybrids were evaluated using the Iowa State University Scale (R-1-R-5), the flight of male moths was monitored by large capacity, funnel type of pheromone traps and the appearance of freshly hatched larvae on developing cobs were counted by visual inspection. The synchrony between the flight peak of male moths and the peak apperance of L-1 larvae on cobs was investigated by cross-correlation. In 2003 (average daily temperatures 20.7 degrees C, average daily relative humidity 59.9% for the period of 4-18 July) "DK 391", "DK 443" and "Maraton" hybrid varieties already reached silking stage (R-1) by the time when pheromone traps indicated a peak, at 7 July (peak capture at 3-day intervals 755.5 males/traps). The number of L-1 larvae peaked on developing cobs of these varieties also at 7 July (7.0, 4.0 and 3.8 larvae/50 cobs, respectively). The synchrony between the flight peak of male moths and the peak appearance of L-1 larvae on cobs was proven (LAG = 0). A rather similar trend was observed in "Vilma" hybrid variety: it reached R-1 stage at 7 July, and L-1 larvae appeared only a few days later (11 July, 3.8 larvae/50 cobs) (LAG = -1). However, "Maxima" hybrid variety reached R-1 stage 1 week later (14 July) than the time of peak captures. Here L-1 larvae peaked as late as at 18 July (0.8 larvae/50 cobs), i.e., only after the cob had reached R-1 stage (LAG = -3). A reverse order of dates of R-1 stage and peak capture was observed in "Maxima" in 2004 (average daily temperatures; 22.5 degrees C, average daily relative humidities 72.6% for the period of 15 July-6 August): it reached R-1 stage at 19 July, while peak trap captures were recorded at 6 August (peak capture at 3-day intervals 20.5 males/traps). L-1 larvae were found in the highest numbers on 2 August (1.5 larvae/50 cobs), practically in synchrony with peak caputres (LAG = 0). "Kama" reached R-1 stage in 16 July, and L-1 larvae peaked at 2 August (1.3 larvae/50 cobs) (LAG = 0). On the rest of the corn varieties larvae were found only in too numbers for performing statistical analysis. We conclude that in order to predict the appearance of L-1 larvae, the phenological stage of the corn variety and the seasonal flight pattern of moths, as measured by large capacity pheromone traps, should be considered in combination. If the corn variety already reached R-1 stage, L-1 larvae appear on cobs as early as the time of peak flight of moths. However, no young larvae appear on cobs despite of high trap captures, until the corn reaches the R-1 stage. These findings are discussed in the view of specifying optimal timing of a pesticide application.

E. Smith) and southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar. The use of such bioassays has, however, been limited by bacterial and fungal contamination of callus cultures following their infestation with insect larvae. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether transferring callus from petri plates containing a Murashige and Skoog medium amended with sucrose, agar, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-(2,4-D), and zeatin to 30-ml plastic cups containing water agar amended with gentamicin and sorbic acid prior to infestation with fall armyworm or southwestern corn borer larvae would reduce contamination without diminishing our ability to differentiate among leaf feeding resistant and susceptible corn hybrids. We found that 62% of the callus cultures on Murashige and Skoog medium were contaminated after infestation with fall armyworm larvae while only 2% of the callus transferred to the plastic cups with water agar amended with gentamicin and sorbic acid were contaminated. Both fall armyworm and southwestern corn borer larvae fed on callus of leaf feeding resistant corn hybrids were significantly smaller than those fed on susceptible hybrids when the callus was placed in cups with water, agar, gentamicin, and sorbic acid. Transferring callus from Murashige and Skoog medium to cups with gentamicin and sorbic acid prior to infestation with insect larvae appears to satisfactorily reduce contamination without affecting the growth of larvae fed on callus.

Pollen from Pt-corn hybrids represents a novel toxin and very little is known regarding its detection and possible avoidance by ovipositing females. The effect of corn plant proximity and corn pollen presence on the oviposition behavior of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (L.), was assessed in cage and flight chamber studies. The proportions of monarch eggs oviposited on milkweed plants dusted pollen from with a Bt-corn hybrid, an untransformed hybrid, gravel dust, and undusted control plants were recorded from a cage study. None of the treatments differed significantly in the relative proportion of eggs found. The effect of Bt and untransformed corn plant proximity and corn pollen presence was also assessed in a flight chamber. A significantly higher proportion of eggs (96%) were recovered from patches of milkweed plants not surrounded by corn plants, and a significantly higher proportion of eggs (nearly 70%) were recovered from patches of milkweed plants not dusted with corn pollen. There were no significant differences in the effects of Bt corn plants or corn pollen compared with untransformed plants or pollen. These results may have important implications for the level of exposure of monarch larvae to Pt-corn pollen.

Samples were collected along a transect crossing a 70-ha planting of Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grand is hybrid extending from adjacent native vegetation to a hilltop. Sampling was completed along an elevation and distance gradient from the native forest in three environments, near the native forest (base), intermediate (mid way between the native forest and the hilltop) and distant from the native forest (hilltop) ones. Fungi, parasites and predators caused mortality of E. eucerus pupae. Damage to E. urophylla x E. grandis hybrid by E. eucerus was greater at the more distant location possibly because of plant water deficits and/or increased E. eucerus survival. Mortality of E. eucerus in all ontogenetic stages was greater in areas near the native forest. Proximity to native vegetation appeared to be a key factor that influenced survival of local E. eucerus populations in E.urophylla x E.grandis hybrid plantations. The results presented here reinforce the concept that native vegetation near eucalyptus plantations exerts a local effect supporting the maintenance of natural enemies of E. eucerus, and favoring infections by entomopathogenic fungi during the pupal stage of this insect.

In the choice experiment, P. xylostella adults showed an oviposition preference for collard cultivars Santo Antnio (control) and Hybrid Kope F1 100MX with wax removal. In the no-choice experiment, oviposition was 6.4 times higher in the Hybrid Kope F1 100MX with wax removal than without wax removal. There were significant differences among larvae feeding on leaf disks of Hybrid Kope F1 100MX in the treatments with (65.3 mg) and without wax removal (23.5 mg). The net reproduction rate (R (0) ), and intrinsic (rm) and finite rates of increase (lambda) of P. xylostella in the cv. Santo Antnio were bigger in the treatment without wax removal (R (0) = 50.4, rm = 0.23 and lambda = 1.26) than treatment with wax removal (R (0) = 28.5, rm = 0.20 and lambda = 1.22). However, only the R (0) value was affected by mechanical wax removal in the Hybrid Kope F1 100MX (with wax removal R (0) = 43.3 and without wax removal R (0) = 30.8). In conclusion, the results indicate that collard's wax is important to accessibility and development of P. xylostella, and its removal changes the resistance of collard's varieties to P. xylostella.

In Heliconius butterflies, mimetic patterns play a role in mate detection between sister species, as well as signalling to predators. Here we show that male butterflies from four recently diverged parapatric populations of Heliconius melpomene are more likely to approach and court their own colour patterns as compared with those of other races. A few exceptions, where males were more attracted to patterns other than their own, suggest that some mimetic patterns are sub-optimal in mate choice. Genotype frequencies in hybrid zones between races of H. melpomene suggest that mating is random, so reinforcement is unlikely to have played a role in intra-specific divergence. In summary, co-evolved divergence of colour pattern and mate preference occurs rapidly and is likely the first step in Heliconius speciation.

J	Castro, BA; Leonard, BR; Riley, TJ				Castro, BA; Leonard, BR; Riley, TJ			Management of feeding damage and survival of southwestern corn borer and sugarcane borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) with Bacillus thuringiensis transgenic field corn	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; MAIZE; RESISTANCE; PYRALIDAE; NOCTUIDAE; GROWTH; LARVAE; EAR	The efficacy of transgenic corn hybrids expressing an insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) delta-endotoxin from different transformation events was evaluated in field corn, Zea mays L., against the southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar, and sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.). Susceptibilities of neonates and third instars were determined on Bt and non-Bt corn plants (V6 and RI stages) in field plots and corn leaf tissue feeding exposure in laboratory bioassays. Bt corn hybrids associated with MON810 and CBH351 transformation events sustained significantly less injury by south western corn borer and sugarcane borer during mid-whorl stage infestations compared with their respective non-Bt hybrid equivalents. Southwestern corn borer and sugarcane borer feeding injury to ear leaf-sheath and husk tissues during the silking stage of corn was significantly reduced in MON810 and CBH351 Bt corn compared with their respective non-Bt hybrids. However, resistance levels to feeding injury in Bt hybrids associated with the MON810 event, were significantly higher than that in the hybrid associated with the CBH351 event. Southwestern corn borer and sugarcane borer caused more feeding in jury to husk tissue than to ear leaf-sheath tissue in both Bt and non-Bt hybrids infested during the silking stage. Laboratory performance of the MON810 event against southwestern corn borer and sugarcane borer varied among hybrids associated with the same event. Third instars of southwestern corn borer were highly susceptible to MON810 Bt corn hybrids in leaf tissue experiments. However, sugarcane borer larvae were susceptible to the MON810 event only in one of the Bt hybrids evaluated. Sugarcane borer mortality was significantly lower after 96 h of feeding exposure on CBH351 Bt corn leaf tissue than on MON810 Bt corn leaf tissue. Plant resistance to southwestern corn borer and sugarcane borer increased as plants matured, independent of the presence of a Bt construct. These results are essential to estimate the importance of Bt transgenic corn in areas of southern United States and other areas where mixed Populations of southwestern corn borer and Sugarcane borer are predominant and cause severe damage to corn production.

The Cry1F, CrylA(b), CrylA.105 + Cry2Ab2, and Vip3A proteins and their isogenic conventional counterparts were evaluated. Larvae were fed on spikelets of Bt and conventional maize, which were changed every two days. The variables evaluated were: survival 48 hours after hatching, larval survival, larval and pupal weight, larval development period, and pre-imaginal period. There was a significant interaction between Bt maize event and Helicoverpa species for all evaluated biological variables. Helicoverpa armigera larvae showed higher survival 48 hours after hatching on maize expressing the Cry1F and Vip3 proteins when compared to H. zea. Lethal period was greater for H. armigera than for H. zea, but, in maize expressing CrylA(b) protein, it was four times lower. There were no survivals for both Helicoverpa species in the evaluated Bt hybrids. In isogenic conventional counterparts, the adaptation index of H. armigera was higher than that of H. zea, which indicates greater ease of adaptation to the environment of that species.

First, the basic biology of host-parasitoid interactions is of fundamental interest. Second, parasitoids are widely used as biological control agents in sustainable agricultural programs. Females of the gregarious endoparasitoid Pteromalus puparum (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) inject venom along with eggs into their hosts. P. puparum does not inject polydnaviruses during oviposition. For this reason, P. puparum and its pupal host, the small white butterfly Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), comprise an excellent model system for studying the influence of an endoparasitoid venom on the biology of the pupal host. P. puparum venom suppresses the immunity of its host, although the suppressive mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that P. puparum venom influences host gene expression in the two main immunity-conferring tissues, hemocytes and fat body. Results: At 1 h post-venom injection, we recorded significant decreases in transcript levels of 217 EST clones (revealing 113 genes identified in silico, including 62 unknown contigs) derived from forward subtractive libraries of host hemocytes and in transcript levels of 288 EST clones (221 genes identified in silico, including 123 unknown contigs) from libraries of host fat body. These genes are related to insect immune response, cytoskeleton, cell cycle and apoptosis, metabolism, transport, stress response and transcriptional and translational regulation. We verified the reliability of the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) data with semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of a set of randomly selected genes. This analysis showed that most of the selected genes were down-regulated after venom injection. Conclusions: Our findings support our hypothesis that P. puparum venom influences gene expression in host hemocytes and fat body. Specifically, the venom treatments led to reductions in expression of a large number of genes. Many of the down-regulated genes act in immunity, although others act in non-immune areas of host biology. We conclude that the actions of venom on host gene expression influence immunity as well as other aspects of host biology in ways that benefit the development and emergence of the next generation of parasitoids.

The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is an economically important pest during the mid-to-late season on non-Bt and some commercial Bt corn hybrids. The objective of this study was to quantify foliar injury and survivorship of fall armyworm on transgenic corn lines expressing Cry1Ab or Cry1F Bt proteins. Corn lines/hybrids expressing Cry1Ab, Cry1F, and a conventional non-Bt cultivar were evaluated against artificial infestations of fall armyworm in field trials. Larvae (second instars) of fall armyworm were placed on corn plants (V8-V10 stages). Leaf injury ratings were recorded 14 d after infestation. Hybrids expressing Cry1F had significantly lower feeding injury ratings than non-Bt corn plants. Development and survivorship of fall armyworm on Bt corn lines/hybrids were also evaluated in no-choice laboratory assays by offering freshly harvested corn leaf tissue to third instars. Transgenic corn hybrids expressing Cry1Ab or Cry1F significantly reduced growth, development, and survivorship of fall armyworm compared to those offered non-Bt corn tissue. However, 25-76% of third instars offered Bt corn leaf tissues successfully pupated and emerged as adults. These results suggest Cry1Ab has limited effects on fall armyworm: whereas Cry1F demonstrated significant reductions in foliar injury and lower survivorship compared to that on non-Bt corn tissues. Although fall armyworm is not considered a primary target for insect resistance management by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, these levels of survivorship could impact selection pressures across the farmscape, especially when considering that transgenic Bt cotton cultivars express similar Cry (Cry1Ac or Cry1F) proteins.

Therefore, large intraspecific variation in timing of budburst of the host may have a negative effect on the herbivore. We studied how asynchrony between emergence of larvae and budburst affects the fitness of Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), a major defoliator of Quercus robur, which can adapt to the phenology of a single tree. It is known that, in maturing leaves of Q. robur, accumulation of condensed tannins has a negative effect on growth of O. brumata. However, there is no information about the effect of hydrolysable tannins and other phenolics that are potential antifeedants. In this study, we also analysed changes in secondary chemistry of the foliage of Q. robur and how different compounds are correlated with growth and survival of O. brumata. The effect of asynchrony on O. brumata was studied in rearing experiments. The neonate larvae were incubated without food for different periods of time. The decline in nutritional quality of foliage was estimated by rearing cohorts of larvae with manipulated hatching times on the leaves of ten individual Q. robur trees. For the chemical analysis, the foliage of these trees was sampled at regular intervals. In the absence of foliage, mortality of neonate larvae started to increase exponentially soon after the larvae emerged. If the larvae missed budburst, the decline in nutritional quality of the foliage led to increased mortality and lower body mass (= fecundity). Hydrolysable tannins were not significantly correlated with performance of the larvae. Only condensed tannins were found to correlate negatively with the growth and survival of O. brumata. Certain individual trees were unsuitable hosts for O. brumata because the decline in quality of the foliage was very rapid. Based on regression equations for increasing rate of mortality and decreasing fecundity, we calculated that a relatively small mismatch of +/-30 degree days between budburst and hatching of larvae leads to a 50% decrease in the fitness of O. brumata. Thus, large phenological variation within a Q. robur stand can limit the colonisation of neighbouring trees by dispersing larvae. Furthermore, the hybridisation of moths adapted to phenologically different trees may lead to maladapted phenology of their offspring.

It is well known, however, that rice plants will suffer more pressure from pests when high nitrogen fertilizer is applied. Therefore, how is the efficacy of Bt transgenic rice against lepidopteron pests in response to N application? In this study, we try to study the effect of nitrogen treatments on the yield advantage of Bt transgenic SY63 (1C*) and SY63 (2A*) [SY63 (1C*) and SY63 (2A*) represent the hybrid variety Shanyou63 contain a Bt gene of cry 1C* and cry2A*, respectively.] over its non-Bt Shanyou63 (SY63) and disclose the relationship between N concentration and Bt protein in rice leaves. Field experiment was conducted in 2010 and 2011 at Zhangbang village, Wuxue city (29 degrees 51'N 115 degrees 33'E), Hubei Province, China from May to October. Treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with three replications, and nitrogen treatments were the main plots and genotypes were the subplots. No pesticides against lepidopteron pests were applied in the whole growth season. It was found that both SY63 (1C*) and SY63 (2A*) exhibited effective resistance to leaffolders, although SY63 (1C*) was more efficient than SY63 (2A*). There were significant correlations between the yield advantages of SY63 (1C*) and SY63 (2A*) over SY63 and their grain yield, respectively. The maximum yield advantages of SY63 (1C*) and SY63 (2A*) over SY63 were both near 20%, however, no significant yield advantages for Bt rice were observed when their grain yield was below 6.5 t ha(-1). There was a significant correlation between N and Bt protein concentrations. Bt protein concentrations at 210 kg N ha(-1) were significantly higher than those at zero N treatment, but there were no significant differences among 90, 150 and 210 kg N ha(-1). In addition, the concentration of Cry2A* was several times higher than that of Cry 1C*. Therefore, it is meaningful to incorporate the Bt genes into varieties with high yield potential and adopt appropriate N management practice to ensure high grain yield, so that its insect-resistance advantage could be fulfilled.

Karyotypes versus Genomes: The Nymphalid Butterflies Melitaea cinxia, Danaus plexippus, and D-chrysippus	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article						Karyotypes; Nymphalid butterflies; Sex chromosome evolution; Telomere FISH; W chromosome	SEX-CHROMOSOME EVOLUTION; BOMBYX-MORI; LEPIDOPTERA; SILKWORM; SEQUENCE; INSECTS; FUSIONS; MOTH	The number of sequenced lepidopteran genomes is increasing rapidly. However, the corresponding assemblies rarely represent whole chromosomes and generally also lack the highly repetitive W sex chromosome. Knowledge of the karyotypes can facilitate genome assembly and further our understanding of sex chromosome evolution in Lepidoptera. Here, we describe the karyotypes of the Glanville fritillary Melitaea cinxia (n = 31), the monarch Danaus plexippus (n = 30), and the African queen D. chrysippus (2n = 60 or 59, depending on the source population). We show by FISH that the telomeres are of the (TTAGG) n type, as found in most insects. M. cinxia and D. plexippus have "conventional" W chromosomes which are heterochromatic in meiotic and somatic cells. In D. chrysippus, the W is inconspicuous. Neither telomeres nor W chromosomes are represented in the published genomes of M. cinxia and D. plexippus. Representation analysis in sequenced female and male D. chrysippus genomes detected an evolutionarily old autosome-Z chromosome fusion in Danaus. Conserved synteny of whole chromosomes, so called "macro synteny", in Lepidoptera permitted us to identify the chromosomes involved in this fusion. An additional and more recent sex chromosome fusion was found in D. chrysippus by karyotype analysis and classical genetics. In a hybrid population between 2 subspecies, D. c. chrysippus and D. c. dorippus, the W chromosome was fused to an autosome that carries a wing colour locus. Thus, cytogenetics and the present state of genome data complement one another to reveal the evolutionary history of the species. (C) 2017 S.

We compare the evolutionary pathways by which two maize pests (the Asian and the European corn borers, ACB and ECB) in the genus Ostrinia (Lepidoptera, Crambidae) probably diverged from an ancestral species close to the current Adzuki bean borer (ABB). We typed larval Ostrinia populations collected on maize and dicotyledons across China and eastern Siberia, at microsatellite and mitochondrial loci. We found only two clusters: one on maize (as expected) and a single one on dicotyledons despite differences in male mid-tibia morphology, suggesting that all individuals from dicotyledons belonged to the ABB. We found evidence for migrants and hybrids on both host plant types. Hybrids suggest that field reproductive isolation is incomplete between ACB and ABB. Interestingly, a few individuals with an ABB-like' microsatellite profile collected on dicotyledons had ACB' mtDNA rather than ABB-like' mtDNA, whereas the reverse was never found on maize. This suggests asymmetrical gene flow directed from the ACB towards the ABB. Hybrids and backcrosses in all directions were obtained in no-choice tests. In laboratory conditions, they survived as well as parental strain individuals. In Xinjiang, we found ACB and ECB in sympatry, but no hybrids. Altogether, our results suggest that reproductive isolation between ACB and ABB is incomplete and mostly prezygotic. This points to ecological speciation as a possible evolutionary scenario, as previously found for ECB and ABB in Europe.

Evaluation of Insecticide Thresholds in Late-Planted Bt and Non-Bt Corn for Management of Fall Armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Spodoptera frugiperda; Bacillus thuringiensis corn; chlorantraniliprole	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS TOXINS; FIELD-EVOLVED RESISTANCE; SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; UNITED-STATES; MAIZE; HYBRIDS; TRAITS; IMPACT; CRY1F	The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), is a major pest of corn in North and South America. It is managed primarily with transgenic corn-producing insecticidal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), but the development of resistance threatens their durability and necessitates the use of alternative management strategies. We conducted late-planted field trials during 2016 and 2017 in South Carolina using natural infestations. We evaluated the use of Bt and non-Bt corn hybrids in combination with foliar applications of chlorantraniliprole at varying infestation thresholds to protect field corn from infestation and damage and determine effects on grain yield. All Bt hybrids were more effective at reducing fall armyworm infestation rates and leaf injury than multiple insecticide sprays, and no Bt hybrid reached the lowest infestation threshold (20%) to require supplemental insecticide treatments, despite infestations in non-Bt corn reaching >68% in each year. The only Bt and/or insecticide treatment to significantly reduce ear feeding or the proportion of ears injured (mainly by Helicoverpa zea [Boddie]) was the Bt hybrid pyramid producing Vip3A. However, significant protection of yield was detected only in the Bt hybrids producing Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2. All Bt traits tested in this study were effective in reducing infestation and feeding damage from fall armyworm, although this did not always result in significant protection of yield. Our results demonstrate the potential and limitations of using chlorantraniliprole with Bt (when resistance is present) and non-Bt corn to manage this pest.	[Bilbo, Tom R.; Reay-Jones, Francis P.

J	Neve, G; Despres, L				Neve, Gabriel; Despres, Laurence			Cold adaptation across the elevation gradient in an alpine butterfly species complex	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Adaptation; Coenonympha; elevation; flight; Lepidoptera; melanism; temperature	FLIGHT; THERMOREGULATION; TEMPERATURE; LEPIDOPTERA	1. Temperature acts as a major factor on the timing of activity and behaviour in butterflies, and it might represent a key driver of butterfly diversification along elevation gradients. Under this hypothesis, local adaptation should be found along the elevation gradient, with butterflies from high elevation populations able to remain active at lower ambient temperature than those from low elevation. 2. The warming-up rate and the thoracic temperature at take-off of 123 individuals of the Alpine butterfly species complex Coenonympha arcania - C. macromma - C. gardetta were recorded in controlled conditions. 3. Warming-up rate increased with elevation in C. arcania: high-elevation males of C. arcania were able to warm up more quickly compared to low-elevation ones. 4. High-elevation C. gardetta had a darker underwing pattern than low-elevation ones. This high-elevation species was significantly smaller (lower weight and wing surface) than the two other species and had a faster warming-up rate. 5. This study's results suggest that the ability to warm up quickly and to take flight at a high body temperature evolved adaptively in the high-altitude C. gardetta and that low temperature at high altitude may explain the absence of C. arcania, while the hybrid nature of C. macromma is probably the explanation of its elevation overlap with both the other species and its local replacement of C. gardetta.

The objective of this research was to determine if various Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn transgenic events influence a. nubilalis oviposition. All commercially available events (currently 5) were evaluated, plus I experimental event. Results from 3 independent studies are reported, including 3 field-cage experiments with vegetative corn, 2 field-cage experiments with reproductive corn, and 2 field experiments with natural O. nubilalis on reproductive corn. In each case, Bt corn hybrids are compared with their near isogenic hybrids by counting numbers of egg masses on each plant type. More extensive comparisons were made in 3 of the experiments by determining the number, size, and location of egg masses on the corn hybrids. Moths laid more egg masses on Bt corn than on non-Bt corn in 1 cage experiment. These results, however, were not found in any of the ether experiments. There is evidence that suggests cage effects influence moth oviposition more than Bt protein. Four of the 5 cage experiments and 2 field experiments indicate that the tested Bt events do not influence a. nubilalis oviposition. Larval injury to isogenic corn during the vegetative stage did not influence adult oviposition during the corn reproductive stage when compared with Bt corn and noninjured isogenic corn. Based on these experiments, suggestions are made for future studies that use natural a. nubilalis rather than a. nubilalis in cages.

Though morphologically indistinguishable, they exhibit differences in their mating behavior, pheromone compositions, and show development variability according to the host-plant. Though the latter suggest that both strains are different species, this issue is still highly controversial because hybrids naturally occur in the wild, not to mention the discrepancies among published results concerning mating success between the two strains. In order to clarify the status of the two host-plant strains of S. frugiperda, we analyze features that possibly reflect the level of post-zygotic isolation: (1) first generation (F1) hybrid lethality and sterility; (2) patterns of meiotic segregation of hybrids in reciprocal second generation (F2), as compared to the meiosis of the two parental strains. We found a significant reduction of mating success in F1 in one direction of the cross and a high level of microsatellite markers showing transmission ratio distortion in the F2 progeny. Our results support the existence of post-zygotic reproductive isolation between the two laboratory strains and are in accordance with the marked level of genetic differentiation that was recovered between individuals of the two strains collected from the field. Altogether these results provide additional evidence in favor of a sibling species status for the two strains.

Inhibition of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Growth by Transgenic Corn Expressing Bt Toxins and Development of Resistance to Cry1Ab	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						eclosion; larvae; pupae	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS TOXINS; STOCHASTIC SIMULATION-MODEL; SOUTH-CAROLINA; FALL ARMYWORM; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; INSECT RESISTANCE; F-2 SCREEN; COTTON; CROPS; HYBRIDS	Transgenic corn, Zea mays L., that expresses the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin Cry1Ab is only moderately toxic to Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and has been planted commercially since 1996. Growth and development of H. zea was monitored to determine potential changes in susceptibility to this toxin over time. Small plots of corn hybrids expressing Cry1F, Cry1F x Cry1Ab, Cry1Ab x Cry3Bb1, Cry1A.105 x Cry2Ab2 x Cry3Bb1, Cry1A.105 x Cry2Ab2, and Vip3Aa20 x Cry1Ab x mCry3A were planted in both 2012 and 2013 in North and South Carolina with paired non-Bt hybrids from the same genetic background. H. zea larvae were sampled on three time periods from ears and the following factors were measured: kernel area injured (cm 2) by H. zea larvae, larval number per ear, larval weight, larval length, and larval head width. Pupae were sampled on a single time period and the following factors recorded: number per ear, weight, time to eclosion, and the number that eclosed. There was no reduction in larval weight, number of insect entering the pupal stadium, pupal weight, time to eclosion, and number of pupae able to successfully eclose to adulthood in the hybrid expressing Cry1Ab compared with a non-Bt paired hybrid. As Cry1Ab affected these in 1996, H. zea may be developing resistance to Cry1Ab in corn, although these results are not comprehensive, given the limited sampling period, size, and geography. We also found that the negative impacts on larval growth and development were greater in corn hybrids with pyramided traits compared with single traits.

When H. armigera larvae were fed seed of resistant and susceptible hybrids in the laboratory there were no differences in larval and pupal sizes or the rate of development. The same result was recorded when larvae fed on panicles on plants in a glasshouse. On some sampling occasions, significantly more eggs were laid on panicles of resistant hybrids in the field. This occurred when plants were in plots and also in a mixed planting. Midge-resistance status did not affect levels of egg parasitism. In a field study using recombinant inbred lines between a midge-resistant and a midge-susceptible line, no relationship was found between level of resistance and oviposition of H. armigera . We conclude that, although midge-resistant hybrids are sometimes preferred for oviposition by H. armigera, the resistance per se does not determine this preference. Egg survival, larval survival, development and resultant damage are not significantly affected by the midge-resistance status of the host.

When infested at whorl stage (2.5 wk after emergence), the cultivars MMV 400, MBR 8650, MBR 8668, MBR 8637, MMV 600, ER-29SVR, Poza Rica 7832, Bulk CG 4141, Katumani Composite B and ICZ2-CM showed leaf feeding resistance, dead heart resistance and stem feeding resistance to C. partellus. The plants of MBR 8637, ER-29SVR and Poza Rica 7832 caused significant adverse effects on the growth of C. partellus. Besides displaying a high degree of antibiosis against C. partellus, the plants of these three cultivars lost very little biomass per unit larval weight gain and lost little grain yield under infestation with C. partellus in the fields, indicating that tolerance mode of resistance also contributed to the overall resistance of ER-29SVR, MBR-8637 and Poza Pica 7832. When the cultivars were infested at anthesis, the cultivar MBR 8637, MMV 400 and Poza Rica 7832 showed stem feeding resistance to C. partellus. The rate of larval development an MBR 8637 and Poza Rica 7832 was significantly lower than the other cultivars. Such genotypes possessing genes for resistance to C. partellus would be very useful for improving the overall level of resistance in the existing commercial varieties or developing new resistant hybrids of maize.

Response characteristics of antennal lobe neurones from males in the so-called E and Z strains, in Fl hybrids and in parental backcrosses were studied. The antennal lobe of a male O. nubilalis comprises approximately 30 ordinary glomeruli and three enlarged glomeruli making up the macroglomerular complex (MGC). Receptor neurones enter the antennal lobe via the antennal nerve and arborize in single glomeruli. Intracellularly stained, pheromone-responding projection neurones in both parental strains arborized in different glomeruli within the MGC, irrespective of their response characteristics. Neurones were grouped according to their specificity to single pheromone components and to pheromone blends. Component-specific, blend-specific and generalist neurones were found. Specificity only occurred at low stimulus concentrations and disappeared as concentrations increased. Although all neuronal types were present in both pheromone strains and crossings, differences in abundance and sensitivity were found. In the parental strains, neurones responding to the major pheromone component and to the respective strain-specific blend were more abundant than neurones responding to the minor component and the blend produced by the other strain. Neurones investigated in ZxE hybrids responded similarly to those of E-strain males, whereas neurones in EZxZ paternal backcrosses responded similarly to those of Z males. In the hybrids and paternal backcrosses, hybrid-blend-specific neurones were present that were not found in parental-strain males.

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) reared on canola's progenitor (Brassica rapa L.), two cultivated canola cultivars (Opera and RGS(003)), one hybrid (Hyula(401)), one gamma-ray mutant-RGS(003) and one transgenic (PF) genotype was compared using the age-stage, two-sex life table parameters. All experiments were carried out in a growth chamber at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. There were significant differences in duration of different life stages of D.semiclausum on its host larvae reared on different plant genotypes. The shortest (12.27days) and longest (15.21days) pre-adult developmental times were observed on cultivar-RGS(003) and hybrid-Hyula(401), respectively. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) in D. semiclausum ranged between 0.189/day (cultivar-Opera) and 0.141/day (transgenic-PF). Moreover, the highest (20.078 offspring) and lowest (12.027 offspring) net reproductive rates (R-0) were observed on cultivar-Opera and hybrid-Hyula(401). The mean generation time (T) of D.semiclausum was the highest (18.34days) and lowest (15.05days) on mutant-RGS(003) and cultivar-RGS(003). The maximum and minimum parasitism values of this parasitoid were observed on canola's progenitor (44.28%) and hybrid-Hyula(401) (37.09%). The heaviest pupae (3.82mg) and females (3.22mg) of the parasitoid were found on canola's progenitor and cultivar-Opera, respectively. The results showed that performance of this parasitoid was better on canola's progenitor and cultivated plants known to have higher levels of glucosinolates concentration than others.

Reinforcement of mate preference among hybridizing Heliconius butterflies	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						assortative mating; Lepidoptera; natural selection; reproductive character displacement; speciation	REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; PREMATING ISOLATION; NATURAL-SELECTION; SEXUAL SELECTION; GENE FLOW; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; MIMICRY; CYDNO	Recent models of mate preference evolution suggest that direct selection on alleles at preference loci and correlated evolution of preference with locally adapted mating cues are more likely to drive the evolution of assortative mate preference than reinforcement. Mate preference evolution in mimetic Heliconius butterflies has been attributed to all three forms of selection, but here we show that reinforcement has been critical. By examining geographical variation in assortative mating and male mate preference among seven populations of three hybridizing Heliconius species from Costa Rica, we found pronounced character displacement of preference such that sexual isolation was enhanced in areas of interspecific contact. Of the different explanations for the evolution of assortative mate preference, only reinforcement is dependent on interspecific contact in this system. Thus, the observed pattern of reproductive character displacement of mate preference is best explained as a product of indirect selection generated by natural selection against nonmimetic hybrids.

We established a homozygous susceptible strain (LAB-PS) from a heterogeneous strain (LAB-P) as follows: We obtained F-1 progeny from 7 single-pair families from the heterogeneous strain. Hybrid F-2 progeny were produced in 7 mass crosses, each of which involved 10 female F-1 progeny from a single-pair family and 10 males from a resistant strain (NO-QA). The hybrid F-2 progeny were tested in bioassays with a liquid formulation of B. thuringiensis toxin CrylAb at a diagnostic concentration that kills susceptible homozygotes and heterozygotes, but not resistant homozygotes. If the resistance allele occurred in either of the 2 parents that produced a particular F-1 family, the hybrid F-2 progeny derived from that family were expected to contain at least 25% homozygous resistant individuals that would survive exposure to the diagnostic concentration of CrylAb. Conversely, 0% survival of a set of hybrid F-2 progeny in the diagnostic bioassay would indicate that the single-pair family from which it was derived was homozygous susceptible. We found 0% survival in 1 set of hybrid F-2 progeny and used the F-1 single-pair family from which this set was derived to establish a homozygous susceptible strain. Subsequent bioassays showed that diagnostic concentrations of CrylAb or CrylAa killed 100% of larvae tested from this strain. The LC50 of CrylAb at 5 d for the susceptible strain was 7-fold lower than that for the heterogeneous strain. The procedure can be adapted for ether insects and other traits, such as resistance to other insecticides.

A Relative Resistance Ratio for Evaluation of Mexican Rice Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) Susceptibility Among Sugarcane Cultivars	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Saccharum spp; Eoreuma loftini; cultivar resistance	EOREUMA-LOFTINI; TEXAS SUGARCANE; PYRALIDAE; OVIPOSITION; MANAGEMENT; VARIETIES	The Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), is a major pest of sugarcane (hybrids of Saccharum spp.) in Louisiana and Texas. Resistance to E. loftini was evaluated in 51 commercial and experimental cultivars of sugarcane, energycane (hybrids of Saccharum spp.), and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench and hybrids of Sorghum spp.] in four replicated small plot field experiments from 2009 to 2012. A relative resistance ratio was developed to compare levels of susceptibility among cultivars based on the percentage of bored internodes and survival to adulthood. This index was able to separate cultivars into five resistance categories and provides a new method for comparing levels of resistance among cultivars. E. loftini pest pressure in 2009 was among the highest recorded with injury ranging from 55 to 88% bored internodes. Commercial sugarcane cultivar HoCP 85-845 was identified as resistant in three of four experiments, whereas HoCP 04-838 was identified as susceptible in all experiments. Of the five sugarcane cultivars in commercial production in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, only TCP 87-3388 was categorized as resistant. Of the cultivars with potential for bioenergy production, all of the energycane cultivars demonstrated higher levels of resistance than high-biomass and sweet sorghum cultivars. Continued evaluation of cultivar resistance to E. loftini is important to development of effective integrated pest management strategies for this pest.

The concentrations of total soluble phenols and chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid), and the activities of the oxidative enzymes peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), were estimated in leaves of Coffea arabica, C. racemosa, and progenies of crosses between these species, which have different levels of resistance, before and after attack by this insect. The results indicate that phenols do not play a central role in resistance to the coffee leaf miner. Differences were detected between the parental species in terms of total soluble phenol concentrations and activities of the oxidative enzymes. However, resistant and susceptible hybrid plants did not differ in any of these characteristics. Significant induction of chlorogenic acid and PPO was only found in C. racemosa, the parental donator of the resistance genes against L. coffeella. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis also showed qualitative similarity between hybrids and the susceptible C. arabica. These results suggest that the phenolic content and activities of POD and PPO in response to the attack by the leaf miner may not be a strong evidence of their participation in direct defensive mechanisms.

There was an effective response to artificial selection for high (H line) and low (L line) female mating frequency with significant separation of the lines by the second generation of selection. The mean female mating frequency in the parental generation (1.57 matings per female) reached plateaus of 2.50 and 1.25 matings per female in the H and L lines, respectively, after six generations of selection. Selection response becomes saturated at about 90% and 25% levels of polyandry (percentage females re-mating) in the H and L lines, respectively, and consequently mono and polyandric pure strains were not obtained. Polyandry levels in offspring from the H and L lines and their hybrids in F-1, F-2 and backcrosses consistently indicate that female mating frequency was more or less proportional to the relative amounts of genes derived from the H and L lines. Such a clear pattern of hybrid responses, together with the gradual selective changes under artificial selection, suggests the involvement of a polygenic system. Female mating frequencies from progeny of the two reciprocal F-1 crosses were not significantly different, which suggest that the trait was autosomally inherited. Moreover, female mating frequency of F-1 (pooled) progeny was not significantly different from the mid-parental value, which suggest no dominance. The computation of the Cavalli's joint scaling test consistently confirmed these results yielding values of d=0.51 > 0.10 and h = 0.12 +/- 0.21. The broad sense heritability estimate was H-2 = 0.73. It is concluded that polyandry in S. exigua is a polygenic, autosomal heritable trait and that additive genetic variance is available for selection for female mating frequency. The implications of the genetic basis of polyandry are briefly discussed in the context of current theories about this crucial insect mating system.

A Survey of the Insects of the Southern High Plains (Llano Estacado) of Texas, with Particular Reference to Pollinators and Other Anthophiles	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Pollination; Conservation Reserve Program; land use; blue vane traps; targeted netting	HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; BEES HYMENOPTERA; AMERICA NORTH; UNITED-STATES; DIVERSITY; GENUS; VISITORS; ILLINOIS; SOLIDAGO; DIPTERA	The economic value of insect pollination to the world economy is tremendous, and pollination service is critical for our food supply and persistence of native plants. Little data are currently available on pollinator occurrence in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas. Past studies on hybrid cottonseed production in the region documented high abundance of six species of Agapostemon and lower abundance of Diadasia spp., Melissodes spp., and Perdita spp. Historical records indicated the presence of Bombus fraternus and B. pensylvanicus which now have Endangered and Vulnerable IUCN status respectively. In 2013 and 2014, we used blue vane traps and targeted netting to collect insect pollinators and anthophiles on the three dominant land uses in the region; cropland, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and native grasslands. With capture methods combined, we collected 74,215 insect specimens; 63% of the specimens were Hymenoptera (289 taxa), 28.61% were Coleoptera (150 taxa), 4.48% were Diptera (115 taxa), 2.34% were Lepidoptera (60 taxa), and 1.61% were of other orders (15 taxa). Our capture included all previously documented bee genera, but we did not detect B. fraternus. Studies support that blue vane traps are an effective method of trapping bees and our results demonstrated that they are also effective in attracting some families of anthophilous Coleoptera and Diptera. However, we captured several species of Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera with aerial nets that we did not capture in blue vane traps. This study documents pollinator and anthophile species present in a highly altered landscape and is the most comprehensive list of pollinators and anthophiles in this region to date.

Diversity of Insect Pests Damaging Quality of "Huitlacoche" (Corn Smut) at Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico	SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							USTILAGO-MAYDIS; COLEOPTERA	Huitlacoche or corn smut, Ustilago maydis (DC.) Corda, is a biotrophic fungal pathogenic. The scales that grow in ears of maize, Zea mays L., are used as fresh or raw vegetables. In some regions of Mexico, maize is planted to harvest "huitlacoche", a crop also susceptible to attack by insect pests that affect its quality. The purpose of this study was to recognize entomofauna in maize ears infected with huitlacoche (corn smut) and identify pest species that attack huitlacoche in five maize hybrids. We collected a total of 515 specimens in four orders, seven families, and 11 species. The orders Coleoptera and Lepidoptera comprised 71.4% of the total number of families, 81.8% of the species, and 99.6% of individuals. The percentage of damaged ears ranged from 47.5 to 65.0%. Species best represented were Cotinis mutabilis (Gory and Percheron), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), Heliothis virescens (Fabricius), and Carpophilus lugubris Murray considered primary pest of huitlacoche because they were present in all maize studied. Shannon-Wiener diversity (0.592 bits per individual) and Simpson (0.302 bits per individual) indices showed less diversity of individuals and moderate species dominance. Greatest richness of species was in hybrids 'AN388' and 'H-318', each with seven.

Both isoline hybrids and non-Bt lead hybrids were compared against Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) hybrids to measure effects of the pest on yield. The European corn borer economic analysis model was used to make site-specific predictions of loss per European corn borer larva for comparison with measured yield loss per larva. Although the model did not predict loss per larva at a field level, it did predict loss at a regional level. The model predicted an overall percentage of yield loss per larva of 2.69 +/- 0.12% over the region, which was similar to the measured yield loss per larva of 2.66 +/- 0.59% for isoline hybrids and 3.08 +/- 0.51% for lead hybrids. The model, on average, provided a good prediction of percentage of yield loss per larva within the climatic zones of 1100-1700 degree-days (DD) (base threshold 12.5 degreesC). Our results suggest that the yield loss relationship developed in Central Pennsylvania, when matched to the timing of third instar second generation European corn borer stalk tunneling is adequate for major corn grain production zones of the northeast United States.

The strain was then selected in the laboratory to increase the level of homogenity for mode-of-inheritance studies. The lines obtained for the reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny indicated that inheritance of permethrin resistance was autosomal and that there were no maternal effects. Degree of dominance (D) was estimated to be 0.37 and 0.31 for the two reciprocal F1 generations, S-female X R-male and R-female x S-female, respectively, indicating that resistance is conferred by incompletely dominant gene(s). Chi-square analysis of responses of backcross progeny suggested that resistance was conferred by a major gene under the influence of minor gene(s).

VI. Microarray analysis reveals that most herbivore-specific transcriptional changes are mediated by fatty acid-amino acid conjugates	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PLANT MESSENGER-RNAS; LARGE-SCALE CHANGES; INDUCED INCREASES; ORAL SECRETIONS; EXPRESSION; JASMONATE; TOBACCO; GENE; ACCUMULATION; RESPONSES	Evidence is accumulating that insect-specific plant responses are mediated by constituents in the oral secretions and regurgitants (R) of herbivores, however the relative importance of the different potentially active constituents remains unclear. Fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) are found in the R of many insect herbivores and have been shown to be necessary and sufficient to elicit a set of herbivore-specific responses when the native tobacco plant Nicotiana attenuata is attacked by the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Attack by this specialist herbivore results in a large transcriptional reorganization in N. attenuata, and 161 genes have been cloned from previous cDNA differential display-polymerase chain reaction and subtractive hybridization with magnetic beads analysis. cDNAs of these genes, in addition to those of 73 new R-responsive genes identified by cDNA-amplified fragment-length polymorphism display of R-elicited plants, were spotted on polyepoxide coated glass slides to create microarrays highly enriched in Manduca spp.- and R-induced genes. With these microarrays, we compare transcriptional responses in N. attenuata treated with R from the two most damaging lepidopteran herbivores of this plant in nature, M. sexta and Manduca quinquemaculata, which have very similar FAC compositions in their R, and with the two most abundant FACs in Manduca spp. R. More than 68% of the genes up- and down-regulated by M. sexta R were similarly regulated by M. quinquemaculata R. A majority of genes up-regulated (64%) and down-regulated (49%) by M. sexta R were similarly regulated by treatment with the two FACs. In contrast, few genes showed similar transcriptional changes after H(2)O(2)- and R-treatment. These results demonstrate that the two most abundant FACs in Manduca spp. R can account for the majority of Manduca spp.-induced alterations of the wound response of N. attenuata.

(Lepidoptera: Bombycidae)	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						Silkworm; quantitative nutrition; nutritional index	SILKWORM	The objective of this work was to assess, through consumption and utilization of natural food measurements, whether mulberry cultivars, Morus spp., could be recommended to rear the silkworm, Bombyx mori L., in a commercial scale. The mulberry cultivars Miura (standard), Korin and Tailandesa and the hybrids FM 3/3, FM 86, SK I and SK 4 were tested. Seventy five fifth-instar commercial hybrid larvae were individualized in gerbox (R) unities and maintained in a rearing room (25 +/- 3 degrees C and 80 +/- 10% RH). The mulberry leaves of each of the five cultivars used to feed the silkworm larvae were submitted to bromatological analysis. The dry weight of larvae at the beginning and at the end of the fifth instar, the food consumed and the feces eliminated were recorded to determine the following indexes: relative consumption rate (RCR), relative metabolic rate (RMR), relative growth rate (RGR), approximate digestibility (AD), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD), metabolic cost (MC). The bromatological composition analysis of mulberry leaf cultivars revealed that the hybrid SK 4 presented superior nutritional quality compared to the standard cultivar Miura, due to its higher content in crude protein and ethereal extract, and lower detergent fiber content. The hybrid SK 4 was the most adequate food to the silkworm larvae because it was ingested in small amounts, thus providing good digestibility to the larvae, low metabolic cost, good growth rate and one of the highest efficiencies in the conversion of the ingested food and ingested and digested in biomass.

The reconstructed phylogeny of mtDNA of the P. machaon group is largely congruent with prior systematic hypotheses based on allozymes and color pattern. Genetic divergences of mtDNA support use of broad, character-based species concepts for the P. machaon group, and allow inferences regarding the origin of hybrid populations. The mtDNA phylogeny provides a guide for evolutionarily appropriate comparisons in studies of the chemical and genetic basis of hostplant use.

FALL ARMYWORM; LEPIDOPTERA	The genetically modified maize containing the Bt gene is a rising from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringienses and is used to control lepidopteran. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different Bt technology for the control of the Spodoptera frugiperda. The experimental design was a randomized block with six treatments and four replications. 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after emergence (DAE) evaluated visual damage on the leaves caused by S. frugiperda, where 25 plants per plot, were evaluated according to visual scale of damage. The assessment of the number of larvae on the cartrige was performed weekly 7 to 28 sampling AED 10 plants per plot, counting the number of small larvae (< 1.5 cm) and large (> 1.5 cm) present in the cartridge. The averages of the visual damage scores of the Bt technologies were lower when compared to the conventional hybrid means at 7 and 14 DAE. At 21 DAE, the Optimum Intrasect technology did not differ from conventional maize, and at 28 DAE the same result was observed as in Herculex technology. At 7 DAE, plants with no damage (note 0) or slight damage (note 1) predominated in the experiment area. From 14 DAE scores above or equal to 3 were observed in the treatments Herculex, Optimum Intrasect, Powercore, VT Pro and conventional, and the percentage of plants with incidence of notes above 3 were higher than 20% only in Herculex treatments, Optimum Intrasect and conventional. The Powercore technology (2B587PW) and Viptera3 (Impact) presented effective in the culture of protectionin relation to the S. frugiperda.

JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY			Japanese	Article						Spodoptera depravata; turfgrass; pest management		Eighteen species and cultivars of warm-season and 14 of cool-season turfgrasses were evaluated for resistance to lawn cutworm, Spodoptera depravata (Butler) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), larvae in the laboratory. Larvae fed on cool-season turfgrass leaves showed higher survival rates than those fed on warm-season turfgrass leaves. All larvae fed on leaves of Eremochloa ophiuroides and Zoysiagrass 'Emerald' died within 6 and 8th days, respectively. All larvae fed on warm-season turfgrass leaves exhibited lower weights (19.9-101.2 mg) as compared to those fed on cool-season turfgrass leaves (193.6-273.6mg) during a 10 day evaluation. Larval development period was longer when fed on warm-season turfgrass leaves (21.5-31.9 days) than on cool-season turfgrass leaves (17.0-19.5 days). Extended developmental periods were observed in cutworm larvae especially on leaves of Hybrid, Zoysia 'Miyako', Z. japonica 'Himeno', native, Z matrella, Cynodon dactylon 'Sahara', and Stenotaphnon secundatum.

This research was carried out to verify the spectrum of pollinating insects and their foraging behavior in relation to specific meteorological variables in the Brassica napus (rapeseed) crop. Data collected consisted of the following observations: number of visits by each pollinator, floral resources collected by Africanized honeybee Apis mellifera L., number of flowers visited by Africanized honeybees in 1 min, number of flowers visited by Africanized honeybees in one specific plant during the timed observation of 1 min, and the time taken by the honeybees to visit each flower. In this study the analyses were made through different generalized linear models. The Africanized honeybees were the most abundant pollinating insects (88%) and most visitors were observed collecting nectar (90%). The Africanized honeybees visited a total of 12.9 +/- 1.40 flowers in 1 min and 2.96 +/- 1.09 flowers of a single plant in 1 min. The time the honeybees spent on the rapeseed flowers was 4.2 +/- 1.6 s. The number of floral visitors correlated closely to the variation of abiotic factors, especially temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Africanized honeybees were more active at different times of the day as compared to the other floral visitors and they foraged more intensely on the Hyola 433 hybrid than on the Hyola 61 hybrid. The Hyola 61 hybrid was more attractive to Diabrotica speciosa and Lepidoptera.

EFFICACY OF CRY1F INSECTICIDAL PROTEIN IN MAIZE AND COTTON FOR CONTROL OF FALL ARMYWORM (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE)	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						Bacillus thuringiensis var. aizawai; Spodoptera frugiperda; cotton; maize; IPM; Cry1F	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS CORN; SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA; BORER LEPIDOPTERA; LARVAE; FIELD; RESISTANCE; SURVIVAL; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; CULTIVARS	Efficacy of maize, Zea mays L., hybrids and cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), varieties expressing Cry1F insecticidal crystal protein of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) var. aizawai Berliner (transformation event TC1507 in corn and event DAS-24236-5 in cotton) was evaluated for control of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith). Control of natural and artificial fall armyworm infestations of eggs and various larval stages to 3 Cry1F and non-Bt maize isoline pairs at V4-V7 corn growth stage was evaluated at 10 locations across the United States and Brazil. Varieties producing the Cry1F protein provided high levels of control. Furthermore, control provided by Cry1F-maize hybrids was frequently better than when fall armyworm were managed with 3 applications of foliar insecticides. Efficacy of transgenic Cry1Ac:Cry1F cotton against fall armyworm was evaluated for 5 varieties during anthesis in laboratory and natural infestation field studies in the southern United States. Laboratory colonies of fall armyworm originally collected from corn, bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.), cotton, and royal paulownia, Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb.) and determined to be either the rice or corn-associated host strain, all resulted in low levels of survival when fed matures leaves of Cry1Ac:Cry1F-cotton. In natural infestation studies, levels of fall armyworm in squares (flower buds), flowers, and bolls (fruit), were significantly lower in cotton containing Cry1F as compared to non-Bt cotton. These results demonstrate that maize hybrids and cotton varieties containing Cry1F can be an important component in an overall management program for fall armyworm across a broad range of geographies and crops.

Breeding fruit for insect resistance is becoming more important as available pesticides are limited by more stringent regulations, problems of insect resistance, and residue limits. We present a method to analyze fruit skin damage via treatment of video images. This aspect has not been well studied to date, hut would allow a more rapid assessment of fruit resistance to insects in breeding programs. The method uses equipment available on the world video and computer markets. Over 24 hours, larvae of lightbrown apple moth [Epiphyas postvittana Walker (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)] were permitted to chew restricted areas of skin on the pear cultivars Sensation Red Bartlett, Packham's Triumph, Doyenne du Comice, Beurre d'Anjou, and Corella (Pyrus communis L.); Twentieth Century (Pyrus pyrifolia Burm. Nak,); Ya Li (Pyrus xbretschneideri Rehd,); and F-1 hybrids of 'Packham's Triumph' x 'Twentieth Century'. Optimum experimental conditions and statistical analyses are described and sensitivity of the various cultivars is discussed. The method allowed us to identify some highly resistant and sensitive pear hybrids, The ability to rapidly screen F-1 hybrids for insect resistance may encourage breeders to incorporate such a factor in breeding programs, and should hasten the release of resistant cultivars, The application of this technique in the orchard is discussed. The method also allows the analysis of various aspects of larval feeding, such as number and size of wounds, which may be responses to various fruit skin defense systems.

The western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is historically a pest of both corn (Zea mays L. (Poales: Poaceae)) and dry beans (Phaseolus sp. L. (Fabales: Fabaceae)) in the western Great Plains. However, it has recently undergone an eastward range expansion establishing itself across the Corn Belt in 25 states and 4 Canadian provinces.To mitigate the effects of infestation in Michigan, foliar insecticides are used in dry beans, whereas management of the pest in corn relies more heavily on the use of Bt-expressing hybrids. In this study stable carbon isotope analysis was used to determine what crop adult moths developed on as larvae with analysis showing that very few of the adult moths developed on dry beans. These results suggest that beans and corn are not suitable as co-refuges and that mainly adults which developed on corn are contributing to the next generation of western bean cutworm in Michigan.

J	Myers, SW; Wedberg, JL				Myers, SW; Wedberg, JL			Development of an economic injury level for European corn borer (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae) on corn grown for silage	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Ostrinia nubilalis; economic injury level; economic threshold; silage corn	YIELD; INFESTATION	Studies were conducted in 1996 and 1997 at 2 locations in Wisconsin to assess the impact of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), on corn grown for silage. Relationships between silage yield losses and control costs were used to develop economic injury levels specific to corn grown for silage in Wisconsin. Treatments were established as the percentage of plants infested with European corn borers. Treatment levels of 0, 12, 24, 40, and 84% of plants infested were used to separately examine simulations of 1st- and end-generation European corn borer infestations. Experiments were performed using Pioneer dual purpose hybrids 3394 and 3751. Results from experiments showed that overall whole plant dry matter yields for 3394 were 8.5% > 3751 across the 3 experiments. Increasing European corn borer infestation proved to Le highly correlated with a decrease in both whole plant and stover silage yields throughout experiments, hybrids, and simulated European corn borer generations. Differences in the rates of yield reduction were not seen between the 2 hybrids, however simulations of 1st-generation European corn borer infestation caused greater reductions than did simulations of 2nd-generation European corn borers. Linear regression models proved to best fit the yield loss relationships and were developed to describe silage yield losses resulting from European corn borer infestations. Economic injury levels were determined by comparing silage yield reductions and associated monetary losses with control costs. Economic injury levels were calculated separately for both 1st- and 2nd-generation European corn borers.

As an important economical insect,Bombyx mori(B. mori) has been used as an insect model of Lepidoptera. However, the recognition of the Toll-Spatzle pathway in silkworm is very limited. In this study, we reported thatB. moriSpatzle2 (BmSpz2) could be activated by pathogens. The activated BmSpz2 could bind withB. moriToll11 (BmToll11) orB. moriToll9-1 (BmToll9-1). Further investigations showed that overexpression of BmToll11 or BmToll9-1 could significantly upregulate AMPs expression. The findings of this study confirmed that a Toll-Spz pathway regulated immune response to microbial infection inB. moriand may help improve the understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the innate immune responses of Lepidoptera insect. The Toll-Spatzle pathway is a crucial defense mechanism in insect innate immunity, it plays an important role in fighting against pathogens through the regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression. AlthoughTollandSpatzle(Spz) genes have been identified inBombyx mori, little is known regarding the specificSpzandTollgenes members involved in innate immunity. There is also limited direct evidence of the interaction between Spz and Toll. In this study, the dual-luciferase reporter assay results showed that BmToll11 and BmToll9-1 could activate bothdrosomycinanddiptericinpromoters in S2 cells. Furthermore,BmToll11,BmToll9-1, and fiveBmSpzsgenes were found to be significantly upregulated inB. moriinfected byEscherichia coliandStaphylococcus aureus. Additionally, the yeast two-hybrid assay results confirmed that BmSpz2, but not other BmSpzs, could interact with both BmToll11 and BmToll9-1. These findings suggest that the activated BmSpz2 can bind with BmToll11 and BmToll9-1 to induce the expression of AMPs after the silkworm is infected by pathogens.

Critical yield components and key loss factors of tropical cucumber crops	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Cucumis sativus; crop life analysis; Diaphania spp.; nitrogen deficiency; flower loss; fruit loss	PEST	The critical components and the key factors of yield losses in autumn-winter and spring-summer cucumber crops were determined and quantified in Vicosa county, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in areas cultivated with gynoecium hybrids of the groups Aodai (Sprint 440 II) and "Caipira" (Vlasstar). The data were used to build crop life tables. The overall losses in the autumn winter and spring-summer cultivations were of 53.5 and 66.6 ton ha(-1), representing 76.3% and 59.2% of the overall crop yield potential. A critical component of yield loss was flower abortion in both cultivation periods. Fruit loss in the autumn-winter cultivation period was due to deficient pollination and production of non-marketable fruit size, and fruit damage caused by Diaphania spp. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), factors that also affected losses in the spring-summer cultivation period, followed by the physiological disturbance caused by nitrogen deficiency.

We evaluated seed mixtures of transgenic and nontransgenic maize, B-row strips of nontransgenic plants, adjacent but separate refuges of nontransgenic maize, and rotation of nontransgenic and transgenic maize. We studied how the choice of hybrid, planting time, and weather may influence the selection of a tactic for delaying resistance to transgenic maize. Our results indicate that separate refuges are superior to seed mixtures for delaying resistance. If a high toxin dose cannot be achieved and a small fraction of homozygous susceptible and heterozygous European corn borer neonates survive on transgenic maize, then resistance can develop in 10-33% of the time required under the assumption of a successful high dose that kills all heterozygous neonates. Planting e-row strips may be as good as separate refuges in delaying resistance, but their adoption carries greater risk because of the uncertainty surrounding movement and survival of neonates. The use of transgenic hybrids is the same whether or not they express the toxin gene in silks and kernels of maize ears. Toxin titer decline must be studied because our simulations indicate that development of resistance may be greatly hastened by this process.

De Novo Genome Assembly of the Meadow Brown Butterfly, Maniola jurtina	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS			English	Article						Genome assembly; Lepidoptera; comparative genomics; Maniola jurtina; meadow brown	PATTERN-FORMATION; COLOR PATTERN; EVO-DEVO; LEPIDOPTERA; ANNOTATION; MIMICRY; EVOLUTION; GENETICS	Meadow brown butterflies (Maniola jurtina) on the Isles of Scilly represent an ideal model in which to dissect the links between genotype, phenotype and long-term patterns of selection in the wild - a largely unfulfilled but fundamental aim of modern biology. To meet this aim, a clear description of genotype is required. Here we present the draft genome sequence of M. jurtina to serve as a founding genetic resource for this species. Seven libraries were constructed using pooled DNA from five wild caught spotted females and sequenced using Illumina, PacBio RSII and MinION technology. A novel hybrid assembly approach was employed to generate a final assembly with an N50 of 214 kb (longest scaffold 2.9 Mb). The sequence assembly described here predicts a gene count of 36,294 and includes variants and gene duplicates from five genotypes. Core BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) gene sets of Arthropoda and Insecta recovered 90.5% and 88.7% complete and single-copy genes respectively. Comparisons with 17 other Lepidopteran species placed 86.5% of the assembled genes in orthogroups. Our results provide the first high-quality draft genome and annotation of the butterfly M. jurtina.

E. Smith), and corn ear-worm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), perennially cause leaf and ear damage to corn in the southeastern United States. Transgenic hybrids expressing the Cry1Ab (MON810 event) or Cry 1F (TC1507 event) insecticidal endotoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) were evaluated for management of fall armyworm and corn earworm in central Georgia during 2006 and 2007. Corn was planted at the recommended time in mid-Apr and in late Jun to simulate a double-crop corn planting. Both Bt events reduced whorl infestation and damage by fall armyworm, but TC1507 provided greater protection from whorl injury than MON 810 under severe fall armyworm infestations. Hybrids with the MON810 event usually had less ear infestation by corn earworm than susceptible hybrids, whereas the TC1507 event usually did not reduce ear infestations. Nevertheless, both events prevented ear damage, but there was no consistent difference between the two Bt traits in preventing ear damage. Bt traits did not affect grain yield in either year during the first planting when fall armyworm infestations were low. Both events prevented significant yield loss during the second planting in 2006 when whorl infestation levels exceeded 50% in susceptible hybrids. Because of the greater activity in preventing whorl damage by fall armyworm, the TC1507 event would be useful in mitigating the risk of severe lepidopteran damage to later plantings of field corn for grain production in the southeastern U.S.	Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Griffin, GA 30223 USA		Buntin, GD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Griffin Campus,1109 Expt St, Griffin, GA 30223 USA.							20	62	67	2	23	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC	LUTZ	16125 E LAKE BURRELL DR, LUTZ, FL 33548 USA	0015-4040			FLA ENTOMOL	Fla.

Genome wide association analysis of a stemborer egg induced "call-for-help" defence trait in maize	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; PLANT; INSECT; AGRICULTURE; PARASITOIDS; CONTRIBUTES; MANAGEMENT; RESISTANCE; DIVERSITY; VOLATILES	Tritrophic interactions allow plants to recruit natural enemies for protection against herbivory. Here we investigated genetic variability in induced responses to stemborer egg-laying in maize Zea mays (L.) (Poaceae). We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 146 maize genotypes comprising of landraces, inbred lines and commercial hybrids. Plants were phenotyped in bioassays measuring parasitic wasp Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) attraction to volatiles collected from plants exposed to stemborer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) eggs. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to generate maize germplasm SNP data for GWAS. The egg-induced parasitoid attraction trait was more common in landraces than in improved inbred lines and hybrids. GWAS identified 101 marker-trait associations (MTAs), some of which were adjacent to genes involved in the JA-defence pathway (opr7, aos1, 2, 3), terpene biosynthesis (fps3, tps2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10), benzoxazinone synthesis (bx7, 9) and known resistance genes (e.g. maize insect resistance 1, mir1). Intriguingly, there was also association with a transmembrane protein kinase that may function as a receptor for the egg elicitor and other genes implicated in early plant defence signalling. We report maize genomic regions associated with indirect defence and provide a valuable resource for future studies of tritrophic interactions in maize. The markers identified may facilitate selection of indirect defence by maize breeders.	[Tamiru, Amanuel; Midega, Charles A.

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)	APHIDS	Kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) is one of the most cultivated leafy vegetables in Brazil. Abiotic and biotic factors can damage kale crops, reducing production and quality and making it impossible to market the product. Thus, because consumers demand sustainable production of food, the objective of this study was to evaluate the production of kale and the damage caused by pests of hybrid kale grown in different seasons and under different types of mesh. Two growing seasons, six growing environments and two kale hybrids were evaluated. The parameters evaluated were yield as measured by the total number of leaves, marketable leaves, and damaged leaves. The settlement of Myzus persicae and the damage caused by Plutella xylostella, Hellula undalis and Diabrotica speciosa were quantified. During the dry season, there was a lower yield per plant, but there was greater commercial production due to lower levels of insect infestation on plants. The use of nonwoven shade mesh reduced the damage from P. xylostella and D. speciosa on plants grown during the rainy season and reduced M. persicae during the dry season. However, cultivation under the protection of the organza fabric provided more effective protection against P. xylostella and D. speciosa, resulting in greater production of kale leaves.

Susceptibility to the Cry1F Toxin of Field Populations of Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Mediterranean Maize Cultivation Regions	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						transgenic maize; resistance; baseline susceptibility; corn borer; Bacillus thuringiensis	BASE-LINE SUSCEPTIBILITY; EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; HELICOVERPA-ARMIGERA LEPIDOPTERA; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS CRY; BT MAIZE; INSECTICIDAL PROTEIN; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS; FALL ARMYWORM; RESISTANCE	Maize hybrids expressing the Cry1F toxin provide efficient control of lepidopteran pests. The Mediterranean corn borer, Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefevre), is one of the most damaging pests of maize in the Mediterranean basin. In this work we firstly determined the efficacy of maize hybrids expressing the Cry1F toxin ( event TC1507) to control neonates of S. nonagrioides. Leaf tissue feeding bioassays revealed that TC1507 maize is highly effective against this pest, and the percentage mortality obtained was comparable to that obtained with a Cry1Ab-expressing maize hybrid (Compa CB, event 176), which is known to be highly efficacious against S. nonagrioides. Secondly, interpopulation variation in the susceptibility to the Cry1F insecticidal protein was established for nine field-collected populations of S. nonagrioides ( three Spanish, two French, two Italian, one Greek, and one Turkish). Estimates of the susceptibility of larvae to the Cry1F toxin showed low variability in lethal concentrations and growth inhibition concentrations among field populations. Moreover, no significant differences were found when they were grouped by geographical areas [ Western Mediterranean ( Spain and France) versus Eastern Mediterranean ( Italy, Greece and Turkey)] or by history of exposure to Bt plants ( Spanish vs. other populations). Therefore, the minor differences found in field populations can be attributed to natural variation in sensitivity to Cry1F. The importance of establishing baselines of susceptibility for resistance detection is discussed. Future changes in susceptibility of S. nonagrioides populations to Cry1F could be documented based on this baseline data.	[Farinos, G.

J	Achaleke, J; Brevault, T				Achaleke, Joseph; Brevault, Thierry			Inheritance and stability of pyrethroid resistance in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Central Africa	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						genetics; insecticide resistance; dominance; fitness cost	TOBACCO BUDWORM LEPIDOPTERA; INSECT RESISTANCE; EVOLUTION; EXPRESSION; DOMINANCE; GENETICS; COSTS	BACKGROUND: The cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) has developed esterase-mediated resistance to pyrethroids in Central Africa. To gain a better understanding of how quickly this resistance can evolve, its genetic basis and stability were examined in a field-derived strain of H. armigera (474-fold resistant to cypermethrin). RESULTS: Genetic crosses between susceptible, resistant and F-1 hybrids indicated that resistance was inherited as a dominant trait (D-LD = 0.86) and conferred by a single autosomal gene. The dominance of resistance decreased as the cypermethrin dose increased, so that resistance was incompletely dominant (D-ML = 0.73) at the highest dose tested. Resistance (DL50) of the F-1 hybrid progeny significantly decreased over five generations in the absence of pyrethroid exposure. CONCLUSION: Rapid selection of resistance alleles due to dominance supports the ability of H. armigera to develop resistance to pyrethroids in Central Africa. However, associated fitness costs provide useful information for managing the evolution of resistance.

Susceptibilities of the field strain and a corresponding laboratory strain of the three borer species to Cry1Ab protein in DK69-70 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn hybrid were determined by exposing neonates to intact leaf tissues from whorl stage plants or by feeding neonates or third instars on a meridic diet treated with different concentrations of Cry1Ab protein extracted from Bt corn leaves. Mortality and growth of larvae were evaluated after 2 and 4 d posttreatment in the bioassays by using intact leaf tissues or after 7 d in the bioassays by using diet incorporating Cry1Ab protein. D. saccharalis was the least susceptible species to Cry1Ab protein among the three species, followed by D. grandiosella, whereas O. nubilalis was most susceptible. The 2-d mortality of D. saccharalis neonates on intact Bt leaf tissues was lower than that of O. nubilalis and D. grandiosella. All neonates of O. nubilalis were killed on the diet treated with Cry1Ab protein at 0.5 and 1 mg/kg. The mortality of D. grandiosella was > 75% at 1 mg/kg, but it was < 6% for D. saccharalis at 1 mg/kg. The LC50 values of D. saccharalis were 3- and 11-fold higher than those of D. grandiosella and O. nubilalis, respectively. The LC90 values of D. saccharalis were 8- and 32-fold higher than those of D. grandiosella and O. nubilalis, respectively. Larval growth of the three species on Cry1Ab-treated diet was inhibited, but the inhibition was greater for O. nubilalis and D. grandiosella than for D. saccharalis. The lower susceptibility of D. saccharalis to Cry1Ab protein suggests that it is necessary to verify if a high-dose Bt corn for O. nubilalis and D. grandiosella is also a high dose for D. saccharalis.

Irradiation of Adult Epiphyas postvittana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae): Egg Sterility in Parental and F1 Generations	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						mating disruption; irradiation; sterile insect technique; light brown apple moth	CACTOBLASTIS-CACTORUM LEPIDOPTERA; MEDITERRANEAN FRUIT-FLIES; INHERITED STERILITY; MATING DISRUPTION; SCALE TRIALS; APPLE MOTH; QUALITY; RADIATION	Adult Epiphyas postvittana Walker were irradiated using a Cobalt 60 source to determine the dose needed to achieve complete egg sterility of mated female moths, and egg sterility of female moths mated to F1 generation males. Adult male and female E. postvittana were irradiated at 100, 200, 250, and 300 Gy and their fertility (when crossed with normal moths) was compared with nonirradiated moths. Viable progeny (determined by egg hatch) were found at doses of 100 and 200 Gy, but very little at 250 and 300 Gy. In particular, there was no survival of female progeny into the F1 generation. Males irradiated at 250 and 300 Gy had very low egg eclosion rates (2.25 and 1.86% at 250 and 300 Gy, respectively) when mated with normal females. The F2 generation from those male progeny had a mean percent hatched of <1.02%. Based on our results, a dose of 250-300 Gy is recommended for irradiation of E. postvittana adults used for sterile insect technique (SIT) if sterility of parental moths is the desired outcome. Our data also suggests that inclusion of F1 hybrid sterility rather than parental generation sterility into programs using the SIT may allow for doses lower than what we have reported, especially during initial phases of an eradication program where increase fitness of moths might be desirable. Further research is needed to verify the use of F1 hybrid sterility in light brown apple moth SIT programs.

Inheritance and World Variation in Thermal Requirements for Egg Hatch in Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Erebidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						egg diapause; hybrid; Lymantria dispar; gypsy moth; inheritance	GYPSY-MOTH; TEMPERATURE; DIAPAUSE; DISPERSAL; EMERGENCE; PHENOLOGY; STRAIN	Mode of inheritance of hatch traits in Lymantria dispar L. was determined by crossing populations nearly fixed for the phenotypic extremes. The nondiapausing phenotype was inherited via a single recessive gene and the phenotype with reduced low temperature exposure requirements before hatch was inherited via a single dominant gene. There was no evidence for sex-linkage or cytoplasmic effects with either gene. Eggs from 43 geographic populations were evaluated for hatch characteristics after being held for 60d at 5 degrees C followed by incubation at 25 degrees C. There was considerable variation both within and among the populations in the proportion able to hatch, time to first hatch, and average time to hatch. Egg masses with reduced requirement for low temperatures before the eggs were ready to hatch were present in all subspecies of L. dispar and the phenotype was not fixed in most populations. The populations clustered into three distinct groups, and climatic variables were found to be rough predictors of those groups. Variation in hatch phenotypes between populations is likely an adaptation to local climate and within a population provides a bet-hedging strategy to ensure that at least some hatch synchronizes with host leaf-out. Continued vigilance to prevent movement of populations both within and between countries is warranted, because some of the alleles that confer nondiapause or reduced low temperature requirements before egg hatch are not present in all populations and their introduction would increase variation in egg hatch within a population.

None of the neonates were able to complete the larval period and reach pupal stage on squares of 90, 120 and 150 days old crop of all Bt hybrids. Likewise, on bolls also, zero per cent larval survival was observed in all Bt hybrids except JKCH 1947 Bt where 0.67 per cent larvae could manage to reach pre-pupal stage at 120 and 150 days old crop but failed to form cocoon and enter pupal stage. The surviving larva took more development time (3.7 to 5.4 days) as compared to larvae fed on bolls of JKCH 1947 non-Bt. The average survival period (ASP) of larvae was in order of 150 > 120 > 90 days old crop among the crop ages; JKCH 1947 Bt > MRC 6301 Bt > NCEH 6 R Bt > MRC 7017 Bollgard II among Bt hybrids; and bolls > squares between fruiting bodies. However, reverse was true for speed index of toxic effect. The concentration of Cry toxin varied significantly in squares and bolls and also among the crop ages. The amount of Cry toxin in squares and bolls had significant negative correlation with ASP of the E. vittella larvae.	[Shera, P.

Smith), and corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), perennially cause leaf and ear damage to corn, Zea mays L., in the southeastern United States. Transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) hybrids with the Bt11, MON810, or 176 events expressing the Cry1Ab insecticidal endotoxin from were evaluated for control fall armyworm and corn earworm, at seven locations in Georgia during 1999 and 2000. Corn was planted at the recommended time for each location and 1 and 2 mo later in the southern locations. All Bt events consistently reduced whorl infestation and damage, although event 176 did not prevent whorl damage in the later plantings in the southern locations in both years. All events also reduced seedling damage by the lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller), in one trial and stalk infestations and tunnel length by southwestern corn borers, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar, in another trial. Hybrids containing Bt11 and MON810 events reduced ear infestations in all trials, although reductions were small in later plantings. Nevertheless, both events reduced grain damage from earworms and armyworms by an average +/- SE of 52.5 +/- 5.1% in all trials. The hybrid containing event 176 did not reduce ear infestations and damage. Total grain aflatoxin concentrations were not significantly affected by Bt resistance in any trial (N = 17). Yield responses were variable with the prevention of yield loss being proportional to the severity of insect damage. Although plantings made after the recommended time did not consistently benefit from Bt resistance, Bt11 and MON810 events were effective in reducing damage to field corn when large infestations occurred. The Bt11 and MON810 events mitigated the risk of severe lepidopteran damage to corn, thereby making later plantings of corn feasible in double-cropping systems.

(YieldGard Rootworm), expressing the Cry3Bbl protein on aboveground nontarget insect predators (minute pirate bug, ladybird beetles, and carabids). Visual counts of adult and immature Orius insidiosus (Say), Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer), Hippodamia convergens Gurin-Meneville, and Scymnus spp. occurring in Bt corn and its non-Bt isoline were made at Manhattan, KS, in 2002 and at Manhattan and Scandia, KS, in 2003. No significant differences were found between the Bt corn and non-Bt isoline plots in the abundance (number per plant) of O. insidiosus, C. maculata, H. convergens, and Scymnus spp. Field predation on Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) egg masses was also observed during the silking stage of corn at Manhattan and Scandia in 2003. No significant differences were observed among treatments in predation rate for predators with chewing versus sucking mouthparts. Two laboratory studies determined the effect of Cry3Bb1 protein expressed in Bt corn pollen on C. maculata and carabids. The larvae of C. maculata were reared on Bt pollen, non-Bt pollen, or greenbugs, Schizaphis graminum, (Rondani). The duration of larval and pupal stages, developmental time from egg batch to adult emergence, percentage of survival, and elytra length were compared among treatments. There were no significant differences in developmental time of larvae fed pollen or greenbugs during their first two instars. However, significantly prolonged development of the third (1d) and fourth instars (2d) was observed for larvae fed greenbugs only. Total time for larval development was significantly longer for larvae that fed on greenbugs versus larvae fed on pollen. No significant differences were observed among treatments in the percentage of larvae that pupated or pupal stage duration. Larvae that fed on greenbugs had higher pupal and adult weights compared with pollen-fed larvae. However, pupal and adult weights did not vary between the Bt and non-Bt pollen treatments. No significant differences occurred in longevity and elytra length of beetles among all treatments. Two carabid species, Harpalus caliginosus F. and Harpalus pensylvanicus DeGeer, were reared on moistened dog food sprinkled with Bt or non-Bt corn pollen. No significant differences in mortality of H. caliginosus and H. pensylvanicus were detected among any of the treatments. There was no significant effect of Bt pollen on fecundity and egg viability of H. caliginosus. Our studies showed that YieldGard Rootworm had no effect on the selected coleopteran predators; therefore, this Bt corn hybrid could be used in an integrated pest management system.

Injury and Interplant Compensation for Southwestern Corn Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) Infestations in Field Corn	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						corn; southwestern corn borer; Diatraea grandiosella; refuge; compensation	FALL ARMYWORM; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; RESISTANCE; PYRALIDAE; NOCTUIDAE; SURVIVAL; LARVAE	Growers that plant Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids are required to plant non-Bt corn for resistance management. Refuge in a bag (RIB) is an emerging approach for resistance management where, for some hybrids having multiple Bt traits for a target species, the refuge is planted as a blend of Bt and non-Bt corn. Studies were conducted to evaluate how southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella Dyar), when infested at different densities and growth stages, affected the yield of infested, non-Bt plants and neighboring Bt plants. Infesting non-Bt corn plants with southwestern corn borer larvae caused significant injury. Both the number of larvae infested on plants and the timing of these infestations affected the number of kernels per ear, total kernel weight, and the weight of individual kernels. Infestation timing was more important than the number of larvae inoculated onto plants, with pretassel infestations causing more yield loss. There was little compensation by Bt plants that were adjacent to infested plants. Thus, the risk of yield loss from stalk tunneling larvae in a refuge in a bag scenario should be directly proportional to the percentage of non-Bt plants and the level of yield loss observed in these non-Bt plants. Because current refuge in a bag systems have five or 10% non-Bt corn plants within the seed unit, the likelihood of substantial yield losses from infestations of corn boring larvae is remote given our results, especially for infestations that occur after silking has begun.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers are often useful and reliable for distinguishing closely related species. However, useful mtDNA markers can be unavailable, particularly when such species pairs experienced hybrid introgression in the past. Although polymorphic nuclear DNA markers would be necessary to distinguish such species pairs, recombination, multiple copies, and slower mutation rates of the nuclear DNA compared with those of mtDNA often make it challenging. The objective of this study was to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction that can reliably amplify and distinguish the Tpi sequences of Eurema mandarina and Eurema hecabe.ResultsWe successfully analyzed the nucleotide sequences of the Z chromosome-linked triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi) gene to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that amplified ca. 120-bp products for E. mandarina and ca. 375-bp products for E. hecabe. We suggest that multiplex PCR using Tpi with appropriately designed primers can be used to accurately and reliably distinguish between other closely related Lepidoptera species.

The Cry1Ac expression was found to be variable among the hybrids and also between different plant parts. The leaves of Bt-cotton plants were found to have the highest levels of Cry1Ac expression followed by squares, bolls and flowers. The toxin expression in the boll-rind, square bud and ovary of flowers was clearly inadequate to confer full protection to the fruiting parts. Increasing levels of Helicoverpa armigera survival were correlated with the toxin levels decreasing below 1.8 mu g/g in the plant parts. Genotype-independent seasonal decline of the Cry1Ac toxin levels was observed in all the hybrids. Cry1Ac expression decreased consistently as the plant aged. The decline in Cry1Ac was more rapid in some hybrids compared to others. The choice of parental background appeared to be crucial for sustainable expression of the cry1Ac transgene. The implications of variability in Cry1Ac expression and the seasonal decline on bollworm management are discussed.

Jeswiet (Poaceae) was tested against sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) to assess whether effective control of the pest can be achieved in the field by using perimeter trap cropping with this plant species. Results from large cage and greenhouse experiments showed that E. arundinaceus clone 28NG7 acted as a dead-end trap plant, attracting oviposition by C sacchariphagus females and hosting young larvae in terminal green leaves, but reducing by 4.8- to 7.5-fold the survival rate of larvae in stalk. Two field trials demonstrated the efficiency of trap cropping with E. arundinaceus, with a 2 to 9-fold reduction in number of bored internodes per stalk and a 22% mean increase in cane yield. In a third field trial, reduction of injury was observed up to 40 m from the E. arundinaceus border. We conclude that trap cropping with E. arundinaceus may reduce C sacchariphagus damage in sugarcane crop. Further trials are needed to confirm these results in commercial fields.

Reference genomes assembled using Illumina sequencing technology have provided valuable resources to advance our knowledge regarding the biology, origin and movement of diamondback moth, and more recently with its sister species, Plutella australiana. Here we apply a trio binning approach to sequence and annotate a chromosome level reference genome of P. xylostella using PacBio Sequel and Dovetail Hi-C sequencing technology and identify a point mutation that causes resistance to commercial diamides. A P. xylostella population collected from brassica crops in the Lockyer Valley, Australia (LV-R), was reselected for chlorantraniliprole resistance then a single male was crossed to a P. australiana female and a hybrid pupa sequenced. A chromosome level 328 Mb P. xylostella genome was assembled with 98.1% assigned to 30 autosomes and the Z chromosome. The genome was highly complete with 98.4% of BUSCO Insecta genes identified and RNAseq informed protein prediction annotated 19,002 coding genes. The LV-R strain survived recommended field application doses of chlorantraniliprole, flubendiamide and cyclaniliprole. Some hybrids also survived these doses, indicating significant departure from recessivity, which has not been previously documented for diamides. Diamide chemicals modulate insect Ryanodine Receptors (RyR), disrupting calcium homeostasis, and we identified an amino acid substitution (I4790K) recently reported to cause diamide resistance in a strain from Japan. This chromosome level assembly provides a new resource for insect comparative genomics and highlights the emergence of diamide resistance in Australia. Resistance management plans need to account for the fact that resistance is not completely recessive.	[Ward, C. M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Perry, K.

Ecological and genetic factors influencing the transition between host-use strategies in sympatric Heliconius butterflies	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						coexistence; genetic linkage; host-plant use; Lepidoptera; speciation	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PLANT SPECIALIZATION; HYBRID STERILITY; WARNING-COLOR; EVOLUTION; SPECIATION; MIMICRY; SELECTION; INHERITANCE; ADAPTATION	Shifts in host-plant use by phytophagous insects have played a central role in their diversification. Evolving host-use strategies will reflect a trade-off between selection pressures. The ecological niche of herbivorous insects is partitioned along several dimensions, and if populations remain in contact, recombination will break down associations between relevant loci. As such, genetic architecture can profoundly affect the coordinated divergence of traits and subsequently the ability to exploit novel habitats. The closely related species Heliconius cydno and H.melpomene differ in mimetic colour pattern, habitat and host-plant use. We investigate the selection pressures and genetic basis underlying host-use differences in these two species. Host-plant surveys reveal that H.melpomene specializes on a single species of Passiflora. This is also true for the majority of other Heliconius species in secondary growth forest at our study site, as expected under a model of interspecific competition. In contrast, H.cydno, which uses closed-forest habitats where both Heliconius and Passiflora are less common, appears not to be restricted by competition and uses a broad selection of the available Passiflora. However, other selection pressures are likely involved, and field experiments reveal that early larval survival of both butterfly species is highest on Passiflora menispermifolia, but most markedly so for H.melpomene, the specialist on that host. Finally, we demonstrate an association between host-plant acceptance and colour pattern amongst interspecific hybrids, suggesting that major loci underlying these important ecological traits are physically linked in the genome. Together, our results reveal ecological and genetic associations between shifts in habitat, host use and mimetic colour pattern that have likely facilitated both speciation and coexistence.

However, few reports have been published that explore the efficacy of Bombyx mori nudeopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV)-inducible promoters in antiviral research in the Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera). Here, we screened BmNPV promoters (VP1054, P33, Bm21, Bm122, 39K, P143, and P6.9) and found that the 39K promoter had the highest BmNPV-induced transcriptional activity by dual-luciferase reporter assays system. By 5' truncation analysis, two regions of 39K promoter were critical for optimal virus inducible activity, indicated that they could serve as a candidate to produce synthetic pathogen-induced promoters. Furthermore, we enhanced the virus-inducible activity of BmNPV 39K promoter using a hybrid enhancer comprising hr3 and polh-up (designated as HP39K). Finally, we showed that RNAi regulated by HP39K promoter could significantly inhibit the proliferation of BmNPV in silkworm cells. Taken together, our results have practical value in antiviral research of silkworm and baculovirus expression system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Smith), is a highly mobile insect pest of a wide range of host crops. However, this pest of tropical origin cannot survive extended periods of freezing temperature but must migrate northward each spring if it is to re-infest cropping areas in temperate regions. The northward limit of the winter-breeding region for North America extends to southern regions of Texas and Florida, but infestations are regularly reported as far north as Qu,bec and Ontario provinces in Canada by the end of summer. Recent genetic analyses have characterized migratory pathways from these winter-breeding regions, but knowledge is lacking on the atmosphere's role in influencing the timing, distance, and direction of migratory flights. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to simulate migratory flight of fall armyworm moths from distinct winter-breeding source areas. Model simulations identified regions of dominant immigration from the Florida and Texas source areas and overlapping immigrant populations in the Alabama-Georgia and Pennsylvania-Mid-Atlantic regions. This simulated migratory pattern corroborates a previous migratory map based on the distribution of fall armyworm haplotype profiles. We found a significant regression between the simulated first week of moth immigration and first week of moth capture (for locations which captured a parts per thousand yen10 moths), which on average indicated that the model simulated first immigration 2 weeks before first captures in pheromone traps. The results contribute to knowledge of fall armyworm population ecology on a continental scale and will aid in the prediction and interpretation of inter-annual variability of insect migration patterns including those in response to climatic change and adoption rates of transgenic cultivars.

Gene flow between Bt maize hybrids and open pollinated varieties (OPVs) that do not contain the Bt trait is highly likely in areas where both types of maize are cultivated. Consequently, introgression of the cry1Ab transgene into local OPVs will result in unknown patterns of Cry1Ab protein expression in plants during follow-up seasons when recycled seed of OPVs is planted. Too low concentrations of Cry protein in such plants may result in selection for resistant alleles and accelerate resistance evolution. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of introgression of the cry1Ab transgene into an OPV, on Cry protein concentration levels and pest survival. Bt transgene introgression was done by crossing a transgenic donor hybrid containing the cry1Ab gene with a non-Bt OPV as well as with a non-Bt near-isogenic hybrid. F1 and F2 crosses as well as back crosses were done yielding 11 genotypes (treatments). Cry1Ab protein concentrations in leaf tissue of these crosses were determined by means of ELISAs. All crosses that contained the transgene had similar or higher Cry1Ab concentrations when compared to the Bt parental hybrid, except for the Bt x OPV F1-cross that had a significantly lower Cry1Ab concentration. Survival B. fusca larvae were evaluated in assays in which larvae were reared for 14 days on whorl leaf tissue of the different treatments. Larval survival did not differ between any of the maize plant treatments which contained the Bt gene. Results suggest that Bt transgene introgression into OPVs may produce plant progenies that express Cry1Ab protein at sufficient concentrations, at last up to the F2 seed, to control B. fusca larvae. Resistance evolution is however not only influenced by the frequency of pest individuals that survive exposure to the Cry proteins but also by factors such as genetics of the pest and recipient OPV, pest biology and migration behaviour.

Septin proteins can form highly ordered filaments, bundles or ring structures related to the cytokinesis in fungi. Here, three septin proteins (NbSeptin1, NbSeptin2 and NbSeptin3) from Nosema bombycis CQ I are described. These proteins, appear to be conserved within the phylum Microsporidia. NbSeptins transcripts were detected throughout the pathogen developmental cycle and were significantly enhanced from second days of infection, which lead to our hypothesis that NbSeptins play a role in merogony. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed a broad distribution of NbSeptins in meronts and partly co-localization of NbSeptins. Interestingly, in some of meronts, NbSeptin2 and NbSeptin3 showed localization between the nuclei of the diplokaryon. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analysis verified that NbSeptins can interact with each other. Our findings suggest that NbSeptins can cooperate in the proliferation stage of Nosema bombycis and contribute towards the understanding of the rols of septins in microsporidia development.

Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), based on visual observations in a breeding nursery, were evaluated for leaf and ear injury, yield, and aflatoxin content in an open field experiment. The genotypes were nine nontransgenic inbred lines and six hybrids including a Bt hybrid containing transgene events MON810 and MON88017. Larval development and progressive leaf injury were measured on selected genotypes in companion laboratory larval feeding and field-cage experiments. Resistance to corn earworm was confirmed for one nontransgenic inbred line in the open field as observed by significantly less ear injury with deepest penetration of larval feeding as low as 1.61 cm and total surface area as low as 1.44 cm(2), compared to injury of susceptible genotypes (e.g., depth of penetration as high as 7.53 cm and surface ear injury as high as 14.16 cm(2)). The low injury of the putative resistant genotype approached the low ear injury seen in the transgene Bt hybrid. Fall armyworm was not abundant in the open field, and injury scores were not significant different across genotypes, ranging from 1.15 to 3.33 (using the 1-9 leaf injury scale). But putative resistance to fall armyworm was indicated in one genotype in field cages as observed by less leaf injury 7 to 24 days after artificial infestation compared with a susceptible genotype. Related to yield, kernel weight of the inbred genotypes (as low as 205 kg/ha) was significantly less than kernel weight of the hybrids (as high as 2599 kg/ha), but there was no apparent relationship of yield with plant injury. Few differences in aflatoxin content were observed, but variability was great, average 52 to 2838 ppb across genotypes. One genotype resistant to corn earworm was referred for advanced breeding and testing for resistance to multiple stresses, with the aim to include native resistance to the insects into the genetic background of high-yielding maize, including Bt hybrids, grown in the southern U.S. Further observations of three genotypes were recommended before consideration for advanced breeding.

The ingestion by insects of double-stranded RNAs targeting essential insect genes can trigger RNAi and lead to growth inhibition, developmental aberrations, reduced fecundity, and mortality. This RNAi response is particularly acute in certain coleopteran species, most notably the western corn rootworm, a devastating pest impacting corn production in the United States. The development of next-generation rootworm-protected corn hybrids includes an RNAi-based trait that provides a mode of action distinct from those of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal protein-based traits currently used for rootworm pest management. Unfortunately, many insect species including important lepidoptera and hemiptera pests appear largely recalcitrant in their response to environmental RNA, suggesting biological barriers that thus far limit the utility of RNAi for agricultural pest management. This review will highlight recent efforts to understand the barriers to RNA delivery in recalcitrant insect species, describe recent advances in the commercial development of insect-protected crops and biological insecticides utilizing RNAi, and discuss this strategy in the context of an integrated pest management approach.

Screening for thermotolerance in the silkworm, Bombyxmori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) is an essential prerequisite for the development of thermotolerant breeds/hybrids. In the current study, the aim was to identify potential bivoltine silkworm strains specific for tolerance to high temperature. The third day of fifth stage silkworm larvae of bivoltine strains were subjected to high temperature of 36 +/- 1 degrees C with RH of 50 +/- 5 % for six hours (10:00-16:00) every day until spinning for three consecutive generations. Highly significant differences were found among all genetic traits of bivoltine silkworm strains in the treated groups. Three groups of silkworm resulted including susceptible, moderately tolerant, and tolerant by utilizing pupation rate or survival rate with thermal stress as the index for thermotolerance. Furthermore, based on the overall silkworm rearing performance of nine quantitative genetic traits such as larval weight, cocoon yield by number and weight, pupation, single cocoon and shell weight, shell ratio, filament length and denier, three bivoltine silkworm strains, BD2-S, SOF-BR and BO2 were developed as having the potential for thermotolerance. The data from the present study enhance knowledge for the development of thermo tolerant silkworm breeds/hybrids and their effective commercial utilization in the sericulture industry.

Such zones have been regarded as strong evidence for allopatric divergence by proponents of the Pleistocene forest refugia theory, a vicariance hypothesis frequently used to explain diversification in the Amazon basin. A central prediction of the refugia and other vicariance theories is that the taxa should have a common history so that divergence times should be coincident among taxa. A suture zone for Ithomiinae butterflies near Tarapoto, NE Peru, was therefore studied to examine divergence times of taxa in contact across the zone. We sequenced 161.9 bp of the mitochondrial COI/COII region in 172 individuals of 31 species from across the suture zone. Inferred divergence times differed remarkably, with divergence between some pairs of widespread species (each of which may have two or more subspecies interacting in the zone, as in the genus Melinaea) being considerably less than that between hybridizing subspecies in other genera (for instance in Oleria). Our data therefore strongly refute a simple hypothesis of simultaneous vicariance and suggest that ongoing parapatric or other modes of differentiation in continuous forest may be important in driving diversification in Amazonia.

The Yili area of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China represents the only known region where O. furnacalis has invaded a native O. nubilalis range, and these two corn borer species have made secondary contact. Genetic differentiation was estimated between Ostrinia larvae collected from maize plants at 11 locations in Xinjiang and genotyped using high-throughput SNP and microsatellite markers. Maternal lineages were assessed by direct sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and II haplotypes, and a high degree of genotypic diversity was demonstrated between lineages based on SNP genotypes. Furthermore, historical introgression was predicted among SNP genotypes only at sympatric locations in the Yili area, whereas in Xinjiang populations only O. furnacalis haplotypes were detected and no analogous introgressed genotypes were predicted. Our detection of putative hybrids and historical evidence of introgression defines Yili area as a hybrid zone between the species in normal ecological interactions and furthermore, might indicate that adaptive traits could spread even between seemingly divergent species through horizontal transmission. Results of this study indicate there may be a continuum in the degree of reproductive isolation between Ostrinia species and that the elegance of distinct and complete speciation based on modifications to the pheromone communication might need to be reconsidered.

Corn technologies containing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) were introduced that exhibit substantial efficacy against corn earworm and may reduce mycotoxin contamination in grain. The first generation Bt traits in field corn demonstrated limited activity on corn earworm feeding on grain. The pyramided corn technologies have greater cumulative protein concentrations and higher expression throughout the plant, so these corn traits should provide effective management of this pest. Additionally, reduced kernel injury may affect physical grain quality. Experiments were conducted during 2011-2012 to investigate corn earworm impact on field corn yield and grain quality. Treatments included field corn hybrids expressing the Herculex, YieldGard, and Genuity VT Triple Pro technologies. Supplemental insecticide treatments were applied every 1-2 d from silk emergence until silk senescence to create a range of injured kernels for each technology. No significant relationship between the number of corn earworm damaged kernels and yield was observed for any technology/hybrid. In these studies, corn earworm larvae did not cause enough damage to impact yield. Additionally, no consistent relationship between corn earworm damage and aflatoxin contamination was observed. Based on these data, the economic value of pyramided Bt corn traits to corn producers, in the southern United States, appears to be from management of other lepidopteran insect pests including European and southwestern corn borer.

J	Lawrence, PO; Dillard, BE				Lawrence, Pauline O.; Dillard, Barney E., III			A homolog of the vaccinia virus D13L rifampicin resistance gene is in the entomopoxvirus of the parasitic wasp, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						DlEPV rif gene; wasp virus; symbiotic entomopoxvirus	AMSACTA-MOOREI ENTOMOPOXVIRUS; DNA-SEQUENCE ANALYSIS; PROTEIN; IDENTIFICATION; PARTICLES; GENOME	The parasitic wasp, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), introduces an entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) into its Caribbean fruit fly host, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew) (Diptera: Tephritidae), during oviposition. DlEPV has a 250-300 kb unipartite dsDNA genome, that replicates in the cytoplasm of the host's hemocytes, and inhibits the host's encapsulation response. The putative proteins encoded by several DlEPV genes are highly homologous with those of poxviruses, while others appear to be DlEPV specific. Here, a 2.34 kb sequence containing a 1.64 kb DlEPV open reading frame within a cloned 4.5 kb EcoR1 fragment (designated R1-1) is described from a DlEPV EcoRI genomic library. This open reading frame is a homolog of the vaccinia virus rifampicin resistance (rif) gene, D13L, and encodes a putative 546 amino acid protein. The DlEPV rif contains two EcoRV, two HindIII, one XbaI, and one DraII restriction sites, and upstream of the open reading frame the fragment also contains EcoRV, HindII, SpEI, and BsP106 sites. Early poxvirus transcription termination signals (TTTTTnT) occur 236 and 315 nucleotides upstream of the consensus poxvirus late translational start codon (TAAATG) and at 169 nucleotides downstream of the translational stop codon of the rif open reading frame. Southern blot hybridization of HindIII-, EcoRI-, and BamH1-restricted DlEPV genomic DNA probed with the labeled 4.5 kb insert confirmed the fidelity of the DNA and the expected number of fragments appropriate to the restriction endonucleases used. Pairwise comparisons between DlEPV amino acids and those of the Amsacta moorei, Heliothis armigera, and Melanoplus sanguinipes entomopoxviruses, revealed 46, 46, and 45 % similarity (identity + substitutions), respectively. Similar values (41-45%) were observed in comparisons with the chordopoxviruses. The mid portion of the DlEPV sequence contained two regions of highest conserved residues similar to those reported for H. armigera entomopoxvirus rifampicin resistance protein. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences suggested that DlEPV arose from the same ancestral node as other entomopoxviruses but belongs to a separate clade from those of the grasshopper-infecting M. sanguinipes entomopoxvirus and from the Lepidoptera-infecting (Genus B or Betaentomopoxvirus) A. moorei entomopoxvirus and H. armigera entomopoxvirus. Interestingly, the DlEPV putative protein had only 3-26.4 % similarity with RIF-like homologs/orthologs found in other large DNA non-poxviruses, demonstrating its closer relationship to the Poxviridae. DlEPV remains an unassigned member of the Entomopoxvirinae (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/index.htm) until its relationship to other diptera-infecting (Gammaentomopoxvirus or Genus C) entomopoxviruses can be verified.

Museum specimens provide phylogenomic data to resolve relationships of sack-bearer moths (Lepidoptera, Mimallonoidea, Mimallonidae)	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							ANCHORED HYBRID ENRICHMENT; ULTRACONSERVED ELEMENTS; TAXONOMIC NOTES; BOMBYCOIDEA; ALGORITHM; SEQUENCE; GENOME; GENUS	Mimallonidae, the sack-bearer moths, are a family of predominantly Neotropical moths containing nearly 300 described species. Mimallonidae feed on over 40 host plant families and are found in a variety of environments, but phylogenetic relationships of species within the family have never been investigated. We sequenced 515 loci using anchored hybrid enrichment target capture on ethanol-preserved and dried museum specimens, with dates of collection ranging from 1985 to 2017. We sampled 47 species, representing 32 of the 36 described mimallonid genera. By incorporating 19 dry museum specimens, and recovering an average of over 400 loci for each, we illustrate the utility of natural history collections in anchored hybrid enrichment-based phylogenomics. Maximum likelihood and multi-species coalescent analyses provide robust support for the recognition of six higher-level groups within Mimallonidae, which we designate as subfamilies: Zaphantinae St Laurent & Kawahara subfam.n., Aurorianinae St Laurent & Kawahara subfam.n., Mimalloninae Burmeister, Lacosominae Dyar, Druenticinae St Laurent & Kawahara subfam.n. and Cicinninae Schaus stat.n. Our phylogenetic results also robustly support eight new tribes: Lacosominae: Trogopterini St Laurent & Kawahara tribe n., Lacosomini Dyar stat.n., Alheitini St Laurent & Kawahara tribe n.; Druenticinae: Luramini St Laurent & Kawahara tribe n., Druenticini St Laurent & Kawahara tribe n.; Cicinninae: Bedosiini St Laurent & Kawahara tribe n., Psychocampini St Laurent & Kawahara tribe n., Cicinnini Schaus stat.n. Three new genera are also described based on our phylogenetic results: Herbinalla St Laurent & Kawahara, gen.n., Ulaluma St Laurent & Kawahara, gen.n., Bedosiallo St Laurent & Kawahara, gen.n. Naniteta Franclemont, syn.n. is a synonym of Lacosoma Grote. Six genera are paraphyletic, and in total 19 new combinations are proposed: Macessoga laxa comb.n., Lacosoma elassa comb.n., Thaelia anysia comb.n., Thaelia subrubiginosa comb.n., Herbinalla caudina comb.n., Druentica brosica comb.n., Ulaluma valva comb.n., Cicinnus eminens comb.n., Roelmana pluridiscata comb.n., Roelmana laguerrei comb.n., Psychocampa joanna comb.n., Psychocampa unalca comb.n., Psychocampa hamata comb.n., Psychocampa marona comb.n., Bedosiallo eugeniacomb.n., Bedosiallo forbesi comb.n., Bedosiallo moengus comb.n., Bedosiallo styx comb.n. and Bedosiallo sylvia comb.n. This study is the first to implement the LEP1 probe set on a comprehensive taxonomic dataset that includes many museum specimens, and our results demonstrate that museum specimens can be used in anchored hybrid enrichment studies. Importantly, these data produce a robust phylogeny that will serve as a foundation for future studies on mimallonid evolution, such as host plant relationships and biogeography.

Genetic Basis Regulating the Sex Pheromone Blend in Ostrinia zealis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Its Allies Inferred From Crossing Experiments	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						genetics; hybrid; moth pheromone; biosynthesis; genus Ostrinia	EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; ADZUKI BEAN BORER; NUBILALIS HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; BUTTERBUR BORER; MOTH; BIOSYNTHESIS; EVOLUTION; POPULATION; REDUCTASE; POLYMORPHISM	To gain insight into the genetic basis of the divergence of sex pheromone signals in the genus Ostrinia, we conducted crossing experiments between three congeners: Ostrinia zealis (Guenee), Ostrinia zaguliaevi Mutuura & Munroe, and Ostrinia sp. near zaguliaevi. Female sex pheromones of the three species are comprised of three common components (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate, (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate, and (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate-blended at species-specific ratios: 70:24:6 in O. zealis, 45:5:50 in O. zaguliaevi, and 19:6:75 in O. sp. near zaguliaevi. The differences between O. zealis and O. zaguliaevi blends, and O. zealis and O. sp. near zaguliaevi blends, could be explained by a single autosomal locus with three alleles. However, sex chromosomal as well as autosomal genes should be taken into consideration to explain the difference between O. zaguliaevi and O. sp. near zaguliaevi blends. From analyses of the fatty acyl precursors of pheromone components, it seems that these genetic factors are involved in the last steps of pheromone biosynthesis including reduction. The process of divergence of pheromone components in the genus Ostrinia is discussed with reference to the findings of previous studies.

Smith), is a major target of transgenic corn, Zea mays L., expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins in both North and South America. A highly Cry1F-resistant strain of S. frugiperda was established from a field collection in Puerto Rico in 2011. In this study, three greenhouse trials were conducted to evaluate larval survival and leaf injury of Cry1F-susceptible, -resistant, and -heterozygous genotypes of S. frugiperda on whole plants of five non-Bt and eight Bt corn hybrids. The Bt corn products included two single-gene Bt corn hybrids containing Herculex(R)I (Cry1F) and YieldGard(R) (Cry1Ab) traits and six pyramided Bt corn hybrids representing four traits: Genuity(R) VT Double ProTM, Genuity(R)VT Triple ProTM, Genuity(R) SmartStaxTM, and Agrisure(R) VipteraTM 3111. In each trial, neonates of S. frugiperda were placed into the plant whorls at vegetative plant stages (V6-V10). Larvae of the three insect genotypes on non-Bt corn hybrids survived well and caused serious plant injury. Cry1Ab corn was ineffective against all three insect genotypes. On Cry1F corn plants, resistant larvae survived on 72.9% plants after 12-15 d and caused a leaf injury rating (Davis' 1 to 9 scales) of 5.7 after 7 d and 7.6 after 12-15 d. Both the larval survivorship and leaf injury rates of the resistant larvae on Cry1F corn plants were not significantly different from those observed on non-Bt corn hybrids. In contrast, no live larvae and little or no leaf injury were observed on the Cry1F corn plants that were infested with susceptible or heterozygous genotypes, or on the pyramided Bt plants. The results demonstrated that the Cry1F-resistant S. frugiperda was highly resistant to whole plants of Cry1F corn and the resistance was recessive. Hybrids that contained one of the four pyramided Bt traits were effective for managing the Cry1F resistance in S. frugiperda. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						Ataxia hubbardi; Cylindrocopturus adspersus; girdling; insects; lodging; Mordellistena sp.; oil content; Pelochrista womanana; seed weight; yield	CERAMBYCIDAE; COLEOPTERA; BEHAVIOR; BIOLOGY	Foliar and soil-drench insecticide treatments were used in attempts to manipulate infestation of cultivated sunflower plants, Helianthus annuus LeConte (Asterales: Asteraceae) by Dectes texanus LeConte, (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) a serious pest of sunflowers in the High Plains of the USA. Seed yields were assessed on a per-plant basis for both oilseed and confection type sunflower hybrids in two years. Both insecticide treatments (foliar lambda-cyhalothrin and soil-drench carbofuran) improved yield of oilseed sunflowers in 2004, but not in 2005. Yield of confection hybrids was improved by a systemic fungicide (thiophanate methyl) in 2005, but insecticides did not improve yield in either year. Both insecticide treatments gave good control of various stalk-boring insects such as Cylindrocopturus adspersus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Mordellistena sp. (Coleoptera: Mordellidae), and Pelochrista womanana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), but neither gave better than 50% control of D. texanus. Plants were sorted according to the presence or absence of D. texanus larvae and no reduction was found in total seed weight, seed size, or oil content as a result of infestation. However, mature larvae of D. texanus girdle stalks at the base in preparation for overwintering, a behavior that reduced stalk breakage force by 34-40%, leading to yield losses through lodging. At harvest in 2005, there were differences between cultivars and among treatments in the proportions of D. texanus larvae that had girdled their plants at harvest. It was concluded that further research aimed at reducing crop losses to D. texanus should focus on means of delaying stalk desiccation and/or deterioration, factors that appear to trigger girdling behavior.

O. nubilalis populations also are often vulnerable to the ubiquitous entomopathogenic microsporidium Nosema pyrausta (Paillot). We examined the effect of feeding meridic diet incorporated with purified Cry1Ab on growth, development, and survival of Nosema-infected and uninfected neonate O. nubilalis. Infected larvae developed more slowly than uninfected larvae. Increasing the concentration of Cry1Ab in diet reduced larval development, and this effect was amplified by microsporidiosis. Infected larvae weighed significantly less than uninfected larvae. The relationship among Nosema infection, Cry1Ab concentration, and larval weight was fitted to an exponential function. The LC50 of infected larvae was one-third that of uninfected larvae, indicating that infected larvae are more vulnerable to toxin. This work has implications for resistance management of O. nubilalis and demonstrates that it is important to determine whether N. pyrausta is present when testing susceptibility of larvae to transgenic corn hybrids.

The genus Laparus, with a single polymorphic species doris, probably an offshoot of early Heliconius, shows wide karyotypic variation (n = 20-30, 38) sometimes even within a single individual. The two most primitive genera also show much variation: Podotricha has two species with n = 9 and n = 26-29; and Philaethria shows many phenotypically similar species, two with n = 29 and a still uncertain number (at least 3) with n = 88 (most common), 67-72 (most widespread), 62 (very restricted geographically), 52, 21, and 12. Several interspecific hybrids (Heliconius cydno x H. melpomene) showed normal chromosome pairing, while deficient pairing was seen in intersubspecific hybrids in Eueides tales and Heliconius sara. The importance of these results in the evolutionary study of polytypic tropical species is discussed.

E. Smith), and corn earworm, Helicoverpa tea Boddie, perennially cause leaf and ear damage to corn in the southeastern USA. Development of transgenic hybrids expressing insecticidal endotoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) offers a new approach to managing these insects in field corn. Transgenic Pt hybrids with either the Bt11 or MON810 event, collectively known as YieldGard Technology, were evaluated for control fall armyworm and corn earworm in southern Georgia during 1998, which coincided with a severe outbreak of fall armyworm. YieldGard Pt resistance consistently reduced whorl infestation and damage to low levels and also reduced ear infestations and larval numbers per ear. However, larval establishment did occur on many ears of resistant plants, but once established in ears, larvae of both species developed more slowly and caused much less kernel damage on resistant than susceptible plants. We found no relationship between YieldGard Bt resistance and corn grain aflatoxin concentrations. Yield responses were variable with the prevention of yield loss being proportional to the severity of insect damage. These results indicate that YieldGard resistance is effective in preventing significant losses to field corn by fall armyworm and corn earworm. Further, evaluation under a variety of growing conditions and insect infestation levels is needed to clearly assess the value of YieldGard technology to corn growers in the Southeast.

The maize genotypes tested were Inbred A (Kenya), Pwani hybrid (Kenya), Hybrid 511 (Kenya), ICZ2-CM (CIMMYT), MBR-8637 (CIMMYT), MBR-8650 (CIMMYT), MBR-8668 (CIMMYT), Poza Rica 7832 (CIMMYT), Mp704 (USDA), Katumani Composite B (Kenya), Bulk CG 4141 (Zambia), and MMV 400 (Zambia). Under low infestation (50-60 eggs per plant), the differences between susceptible and resistant genotypes in terms of stalk damage or grain damage were not apparent, whereas under high infestation (90-100 eggs per plant) the susceptible genotype Inbred A and population Bulk CG 4141 were distinctly more damaged than the remaining genotypes. The genotypes MBR-8637 and Poza Rica 7832 were classed as resistant to C. partellus. A regression of grain yield on stem tunnelling revealed a negative relationship between these factors across maize genotypes, although it was significant only for the susceptible Inbred A and the population MBR-8650. Grain yield of various maize genotypes was also influenced negatively by the damage caused by C. partellus directly to the kernels. Losses suffered by various maize genotypes at low infestation were equal but, under high infestation, significantly more losses occurred on Inbred A than on the remaining genotypes. The maize genotypes MBR-8637 and Poza Rica 7832 were classified as resistant to the second-generation stem borer at anthesis and can be used in a programme for breeding maize resistant to C. partellus.

Mark			Assessing ecological and physiological costs of melanism in North American Papilio glaucus females: two decades of dark morph frequency declines	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						climate warming; ecology of melanism; incomplete mimicry; pleiotrophic costs	TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLIES; SEX-LINKED DIAPAUSE; HYBRID ZONE; PIPEVINE SWALLOWTAIL; HOST-PLANT; BATESIAN MIMICRY; WING-PATTERN; CANADENSIS LEPIDOPTERA; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SPECIES LEPIDOPTERA	Polymorphisms for melanic form of insects may provide various selective advantages. However, melanic alleles may have significant/subtle pleiotrophic "costs." Several potential pleiotrophic effects of the W (=Y)-linked melanism gene in Papilio glaucus L. (Lepidoptera) showed no costs for melanic versus yellow in adult size, oviposition preferences, fecundity, egg viability, larval survival/growth rates, cold stress tolerance, or postdiapause emergence times. Sexual selection (males choosing yellow rather than mimetic dark females) had been suggested to provide a balanced polymorphism in P. glaucus, but spermatophore counts in wild females and direct field tethering studies of size-matched pairs of virgin females (dark and yellow), show that male preferences are random or frequency-dependent from Florida to Michigan, providing no yellow counter-advantages. Recent frequency declines of dark (melanic/mimetic) females in P. glaucus populations are shown in several major populations from Florida (27.3 degrees N latitude) to Ohio (38.5 degrees N). Summer temperatures have increased significantly at all these locations during this time (1999-2018), but whether dark morphs may be more vulnerable (in any stage) to such climate warming remains to be determined. Additional potential reasons for the frequency declines in mimetic females are discussed: (i) genetic introgression of Z-linked melanism suppressor genes from P. canadensis (R & J) and the hybrid species, P. appalachiensis (Pavulaan & Wright), (ii) differential developmental incompatibilities, or Haldane effects, known to occur in hybrids, (iii) selection against intermediately melanic ("dusty") females (with the W-linked melanic gene, b+) which higher temperatures can cause.

Here we describe the genetics of Mullerian mimicry in Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), sister species that recently diverged to mimic other Heliconius. This mimetic shift was a key step in their speciation, leading to pre- and postmating isolation. We identify 10 autosomal loci, half of which have major effects. At least eight appear to be homologous with genes known to control pattern differences within each species. Dominance has evolved under the influence of identifiable "modifier" loci rather than being a fixed characteristic of each locus. Epistasis is found at many levels: phenotypic interaction between specific pairs of genes, developmental canalization due to polygenic modifiers so that patterns are less sharply defined in hybrids, and overall fitness through ecological selection against nonmimetic hybrid genotypes. Most of the loci are clustered into two genomic regions or "supergenes," suggesting color pattern evolution is constrained by preexisting linked elements that may have arisen via tandem duplication rather than having been assembled by natural selection. Linkage, modifiers, and epistasis affect the strength of mimicry as a barrier to gene flow between these naturally hybridizing species and may permit introgression in genomic regions unlinked to those under disruptive selection. Mullerian mimics in Heliconius use different genetic architectures to achieve the same mimetic patterns, implying few developmental constraints. Therefore, although developmental and genomic constraints undoubtedly influence the evolutionary process, their effects are probably not strong in comparison with natural selection.

Cultivar LCP 85-384 was more susceptible than HoCP 85-845 based both on injury and moth production. Irrigation, host plant resistance, and insecticide applications of tebufenozide decreased injury from 70% bored internodes to < 10% during both years. The use of multiple control tactics was substantially better at suppressing E. loftini in sugarcane than solely relying on insecticide applications. In addition to accumulations of proline, several free amino acids (histidine and isoleucine) essential for insect growth and development were increased in sugarcane leaves by drought stressed conditions, which exacerbated E. loftini infestations. Modifying the suitability of the crop by reducing water deficit stress makes rational irrigation input a key component in the integrated pest management of E. loftini, in addition to other tactics such as cultivar resistance and insecticide application.

Dried and cleaned grains (200 kg of F1 hybrid transgenic rice) from each rice variety were stored at unlidded ceramic pots (100 cm high, 80 cm diameter), and then stored in a 10-year-old barn. To investigate the species and number of arthropods using a needle-point sampler, each pot had 1 kg of grain sampled from both the upper layer (0-35 cm) and the lower layer (35-70 cm) every 15 days. The results showed 12 species of arthropods including Corrodentia, Acarina, Chelonethida, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were found. No significant differences were observed in the community structure parameters of the arthropods between transgenic Bt rice and non-Bt rice. In both rice varieties, Liposcelis bostrychophilus exhibited the highest level of abundance of community structure, followed by Rhizopertha dominica and Tyrophagus putrescentiae. Overall, there was no significant difference in the temporal dominance curve profiles of the three dominant arthropods between Bt and non-Bt rice. Our results indicated that transgenic Bt rice generally exerts no remarkable negative effects on the arthropod community during storage.	[Wagan, T.

The cultivars were graded into different categories of resistance based on the population of caterpillars per plant. None of the cultivars was immune to the pest. 'Red Pickling' and 'Red Rock Mammoth' were highly resistant in 1983 and 1984 but moderately resistant in 1982. 'Red Drum Head' was highly resistant in 1984 but moderately resistant in 1982 und 1983. 'EC 90730' and 'ARU Glory' were moderately resistant in 1984. Except 'ARU Glory', all are red cultivars. Several crosses were made between red and green cultivars. Six hybrids were moderately resistant but none was highly resistant. The best hybrid was 'Red Rock Mammoth' x 'September' which was moderately resistant and produced medium sized compact heads. But the veins were purple which resulted in less market value. Most of the agronomically good cultivars were highly susceptible like 'Golden Acre', 'Pusa Drum Head', 'September', 'Synthetic', 'Selection-8', 'Pride of India', 'India Market', 'Coloner Market', 'Lousiana All Year', 'Copenhagen Market', 'Pride of Asia', ect.

The olfactory sensilla investigated each contained three receptor cells. Two cells were each specific for one of the two pheromone components, (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (Z11-14:OAc) and (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11-14:OAc). Two strains of cornborers (Z and E) differ as to which of the two pheromone components is the main one. In both strains a large difference could be observed between the spike amplitudes elicited in the receptor cells by the two pheromone components, the main component always eliciting the large spike. In F1-hybrids (EZ) of these two strains, producing both pheromone components in similar quantities, the spike amplitudes were equal in the two pheromone-specific receptor cells. The third cell responded specifically to a behavioural antagonist, (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate (Z9-14:OAc) in both the parental and hybrid strains, and always showed the smallest spike amplitude. In a morphometric study, the outer dendritic segments were shown to differ more in diameter between the largest and second largest cell in the two parental strains than in the hybrid strain, while the smallest diameter cell did nor differ between the different strains. These results imply that receptor cells with larger diameter produce spikes with greater amplitude. The data also show that all three types of receptor neurons display outer dendritic segments with strong variation in the diameter along the length of the segment, and with a pronounced taper towards the tip.

As co-inherited organisms, these bacteria often cause problems in mitochondrial phylogeny inference. The phylogenetic relationships of many closely related Palaearctic blue butterflies (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Polyommatinae) are ambiguous. We considered the patterns of Wolbachia infection and mitochondrial diversity in two systems: Aricia agestis/Aricia artaxerxes and the Pseudophilotes baton species complex. We sampled butterflies across their distribution ranges and sequenced one butterfly mitochondrial gene and two Wolbachia genes. Both butterfly systems had uninfected and infected populations, and harboured several Wolbachia strains. Wolbachia was highly prevalent in A. artaxerxes and the host's mitochondrial structure was shallow, in contrast to A. agestis. Similar bacterial alleles infected both Aricia species from nearby sites, pointing to a possible horizontal transfer. Mitochondrial history of the P. baton species complex mirrored its Wolbachia infection and not the taxonomical division. Pseudophilotes baton and P. vicrama formed a hybrid zone in Europe. Wolbachia could obscure mitochondrial history, but knowledge on the infection helps us to understand the observed patterns. Testing for Wolbachia should be routine in mitochondrial DNA studies.

Reinforcement is distinguished from other models that consider the formation of reproductive isolation to be a by-product of divergent evolution(4,5). Although theory has shown that reinforcement is a possible mechanism that can lead to speciation(6-8), empirical evidence has been sufficiently scarce to raise doubts about the importance of reinforcement in nature(6,9,10). Agrodiaetus butterflies ( Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) exhibit unusual variability in chromosome number. Whereas their genitalia and other morphological characteristics are largely uniform, different species vary considerably in male wing colour, and provide a model system to study the role of reinforcement in speciation. Using comparative phylogenetic methods, we show that the sympatric distribution of 15 relatively young sister taxa of Agrodiaetus strongly correlates with differences in male wing colour, and that this pattern is most likely the result of reinforcement. We find little evidence supporting sympatric speciation: rather, in Agrodiaetus, karyotypic changes accumulate gradually in allopatry, prompting reinforcement when karyotypically divergent races come into contact.

The old technique of splitting stalks of infested plants and measuring the tunneling 35 to 45 d after infestation is inefficient. We developed a new technique that uses rating scales to estimate visually the degree of damage to the leaf sheath and ear husks, the preferred feeding sites by larvae, within 14 d of infestation. The rating scales range from 0 to 9 with scores based on types and numbers of lesions made by the larvae. A rating of 0 indicates no damage and ratings of 7-9 indicate substantial damage. Experiments were conducted to test the usefulness of the rating scales in detecting differences in larval growth and numbers. Our results show that the rating scores were significantly correlated with larval growth and numbers. Significant differences in larval growth and numbers were found among larvae reared on some of the test hybrids. When this occurred, differences in rating scores among hybrids also were found to be significant. Significant differences were found in larval numbers and growth when maize hybrids were infested on the same day but at different physiological stages.

Inheritance of Cry1Ac resistance and associated biological traits in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Helicoverpa armigera; Cry1Ac; Inheritance; Biological traits	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; INSECT RESISTANCE; TRANSGENIC COTTON; BT-COTTON; HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; AMERICAN BOLLWORM; DELTA-ENDOTOXIN; FITNESS COSTS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; DIAMONDBACK MOTH	The analysis of reciprocal genetic crosses between resistant Helicoverpa armigera strain (BH-R) (227.9-fold) with susceptible Vadodara (VA-S) strain showed dominance (h) of 0.65-0.89 and degree of dominance (D) of 0.299-0.782 suggesting Cry1Ac resistance as a semi-dominant trait. The D and It values of F-1 hybrids of female resistant parent were higher than female susceptible parent, showing maternally enhanced dominance of Cry1Ac resistance. The progeny of F-2 crosses, backcrosses of F-1 hybrid with resistant BH-R parent did not differ significantly in respect of mortality response with resistant parent except for backcross with female BH-R and male of F-1 (BH-R x VA-S) cross, suggesting dominant inheritance of Cry1Ac resistance. Evaluation of some biological attributes showed that larval and pupal periods of progenies of reciprocal F-1 crosses, backcrosses and F-2 crosses were either at par with resistant parent or lower than susceptible parent on treated diet (0.01 mu g/g). The susceptible strain performed better in terms of pupation and adult formation than the resistant strain on untreated diet. In many backcrosses and F-2 crosses, Cry1Ac resistance favored emergence of more females than males on untreated diet. The normal larval period and the body weight (normal larval growth) were the dominant traits associated with susceptible strain as contrast to longer larval period and the lower body weight (slow growth) associated with resistance trait. Further, inheritance of larval period in F-2 and backcross progeny suggested existence of a major resistant gene or a set of tightly linked loci associated with Cry1Ac sensitivity.

Historical biogeography of Heteropterinae skippers via Beringian and post-Tethyan corridors	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						Anchored hybrid enrichment; Beringian route; butterfly biogeography; Gomphotherium land bridge; Hesperiidae; Lepidoptera evolution	MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; HESPERIIDAE LEPIDOPTERA; MODEL SELECTION; EVOLUTION; ROUTES; PERFORMANCE; DISPERSAL; ALGORITHM; CLOSURE; TREE	Skippers are a species rich and widespread group of butterflies with evolutionary patterns and processes largely unstudied despite some recent efforts. Among Hesperiidae, the subfamily Heteropterinae is a moderately diverse clade comprising ca. 200 species distributed from North to South America and from Africa to the Palearctic region. While some regions are species rich, others are far less diverse. Using anchored phylogenomics, we infer a robust timetree and estimate ancestral ranges to understand the biogeographic history of these skippers. Inferences based on up to 383 exons recover a robust backbone for the subfamily along with the monophyly of all genera. Bayesian divergence time estimates suggest an origin of Heteropterinae in the late Eocene, ca. 40 million years ago. Maximum likelihood ancestral range estimates indicate an origin of the group in the New World. The eastern Palearctic was likely colonized via a Beringian route and a reverse colonization event resulted in two independent and extant American clades. We estimate a vicariant event between Central and South America that significantly predates estimates of the proto-Caribbean seaway closure, indicating active overwater dispersal in the Oligocene. The colonization of Africa from the east Palearctic is synchronous with the closure of the Tethys Ocean, while the colonization of Madagascar appears to be comparatively recent. Our results shed light on the systematics and biogeography of Heteropterinae skippers and unveil the evolutionary history of a new leaf in the skipper tree-of-life.	[Toussaint, Emmanuel F.

We investigated overwintering costs in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gosypiella (Saunders), strains with different degrees of resistance to Bt cotton. Frequency of resistant individuals in a strain was not associated with induction of diapause or emergence from diapause in early winter. Emergence from diapause in the spring was 71% lower in three highly resistant strains than in two heterogeneous strains from which the resistant strains were derived. This underestimates the overwintering cost because the frequency of the resistance allele was relatively high in the heterogeneous strains. Emergence in the spring in hybrid progeny from crosses between the resistant and heterogeneous strains was greater than in resistant strains but did not differ from susceptible strains, showing that the overwintering cost was recessive to some extent.

Decline in Sublethal Effects of Bt Corn on Corn Earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Linked to Increasing Levels of Resistance	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Helicoverpa zea; transgenic crops; Bacillus thuringiensis; maize	HELICOVERPA-ZEA LEPIDOPTERA; FALL ARMYWORM; HOST USE; TOXINS; MANAGEMENT; TRAITS; COTTON; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; CRAMBIDAE	As part of an ongoing longitudinal study in North and South Carolina, this study reports the recovery of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) pupae in field trials with genetically engineered corn, Zea mays L., hybrids that produce insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in 2017-2019. In total, 10,400 corn ears were collected, which led to 3,927 H. zea pupae (2,215 in South Carolina and 1,712 in North Carolina). Late-planted corn led to a 3.39-fold increase in recovery of pupae compared to early-planted corn. Bt corn expressing Cry1F + Cry1Ab and Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 had 1.67-fold and 2.51-fold fewer pupae than non-Bt near-isolines, respectively. Only six pupae were recovered from the hybrid expressing Cry1F + Cry1Ab + Vip3Aa20. Averaged across trials, Bt corn expressing either Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 or Cry1F + Cry1Ab significantly reduced pupal weight compared to non-Bt near-isolines in North and South Carolina. Combining our data with a previous study at the same locations (Bilbo et al. 2018), reduction in pupal weight between Bt and non-Bt near-isolines significantly declined from 2014 to 2019 for Cry1Ab + Cry1F in North and South Carolina. This decline in levels of a sublethal effect of Bt corn expressing Cry1Ab + Cry1F on H. zea at both locations is likely correlated with resistance development.	[Reay-Jones, Francis P.

In the case of plants expressing Bt-toxins, the F-2 tissue in the kernels will express toxins as they would segregate in any F-2 tissue. In the case of plants expressing two unlinked toxins, the kernels on a Bt plant fertilized by another Bt plant would express anywhere from 0 to 2 toxins. Larvae of corn earworm [Helicoverpa zea (Boddie)] feed on a number of kernels during development and would therefore be exposed to local habitats (kernels) that varied in their toxin expression. Three models were developed for plants expressing two Bt-toxins, one where the traits are unlinked, a second where the traits were linked and a third model assuming that maternal traits were expressed in all kernels as well as paternally inherited traits. Results suggest that increasing larval movement rates off of expressing kernels tended to increase durability while increasing movement rates off of nonexpressing kernels always decreased durability. An ideal block refuge (no pollen flow between blocks and refuges) was more durable than a seed blend because the refuge expressed no toxins, while pollen contamination from plants expressing toxins in a seed blend reduced durability. A linked-trait model in an ideal refuge model predicted the longest durability. The results suggest that using a seed-blend strategy for a kernel feeding insect on a hybrid crop could dramatically reduce durability through the loss of refuge due to extensive cross-pollination.

Divergence in Heliconius flight behaviour is associated with local adaptation to different forest structures	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						behaviour; flight height; host plants; Lepidoptera; local adaptation; vertical distribution	VERTICAL STRATIFICATION; MICROHABITAT USE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; HYBRID ZONES; SPECIATION; MIMICRY; PATTERNS; LEPIDOPTERA; BUTTERFLIES; COMMUNITY	Microhabitat choice plays a major role in shaping local patterns of biodiversity. In butterflies, stratification in flight height has an important role in maintaining community diversity. Despite its presumed importance, the role of behavioural shifts in early stages of speciation in response to differences in habitat structure is yet to be established. Here, we investigated variation in flight height behaviour in two closely related Heliconius species, H. erato cyrbia and H. himera, which produce viable hybrids but are isolated across an environmental gradient, spanning lowland wet forest to high-altitude scrub forest. Speciation in this pair is associated with strong assortative mating, but ecological isolation and local adaptation are also considered essential for complete reproductive isolation. We quantified differences in flight height and forest structure across the environmental gradient and tested the importance of resource distribution in explaining flight behaviour. We then used common garden experiments to test whether differences in flight height reflect individual responses to resource distribution or genetically determined shifts in foraging behaviour. We found that the two species fly at different heights in the wild, and demonstrated that this can be explained by differences in the vertical distribution of plant resources. In both the wild and captivity, H. himera choose to fly lower and feed at lower positions, closely mirroring differences in resource availability in the wild. Given expectations that foraging efficiency contributes to survival and reproductive success, we suggest that foraging behaviour may reflect local adaptation to divergent forest structures. Our results highlight the potential role of habitat-dependent divergence in behaviour during the early stages of speciation.	[Dell'Aglio, Denise D.; Mena, Sebastian; Mauxion, Remi; McMillan, W.

Inheritance of field-relevant resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis protein Cry1Ac in Pectinophora gossypiella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) collected from India	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Pectinophora gossypiella; Cry1Ac; insect resistance; Cry2Ab2; Bollgard; transgenic cotton	MANAGING INSECT RESISTANCE; BT TOXIN CRY1AC; EVOLVED RESISTANCE; PINK-BOLLWORM; COTTON BOLLWORM; NOCTUIDAE; MAIZE; GENETICS; STRAIN	BACKGROUNDThe inheritance and phenotypic expression of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac insecticidal protein were studied in selected populations of pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), that were collected from Bollgard cotton in India. The individual populations in the pool were Cry1Ac resistant and sourced from Cry1Ac-containing Bt cotton (Bollgard) hybrids in 2010. RESULTSLaboratory selection on diet with 1.0 mu g Cry1Ac protein mL(-1) increased the percentage reaching at least third instar from 7% in the F3 generation to 94% in the F15 generation, a 257-fold increase in median lethal concentration relative to the susceptible strain. Analysis of reciprocal genetic crosses between the Cry1Ac-resistant strain NKJ and a susceptible laboratory strain MRC showed a dominance of 0.22, indicating that the inheritance of Cry1Ac resistance is partially recessive at Cry1Ac concentrations comparable with those in Bollgard. Analyses of backcrosses of F1 hybrid moths with NKJ and MRC indicated that resistance is autosomal. The Cry1Ac-resistant strain exhibited little or no cross-resistance to the Cry2Ab2 protein. CONCLUSIONThis is the first study of the dominance of Cry1Ac field resistance in P. gossypiella. The results provide the basis for refining resistance management strategies for Bt cotton.

In the laboratory, the cutworm larvae developed normally on honey mesquite (P. glandulosa Torrey var. glandulosa) and the Argentine vinal (P. ruscifolia Grisebach). Velvet mesquite (P. velutina Wooton), western honey mesquite (P. g. var. torreyana (Benson) Johnston), the Mexican P. laevigata (H. and B. ex. Willdenow) Johnston and P. juliflora (Swartz) DC, and the Argentine P. flexuosa DC were slightly less suitable hosts. Larvae developed occasionally on a natural hybrid of the Argentine P. alba Grisebach from Tucson, Arizona, but not on a commercial P. alba hybrid developed in southern Texas. Larvae did not develop on the two screw-bean mesquites tested (P. pubescens Bentham and P. reptans Bentham var. cinerascens (A. Gray) Burkart) or on 12 other species of woody legumes from central Texas, although an occasional larva fed for a few days on some of them. Among 11 species of mostly tropical leguminous trees tested, larvae developed and produced adults normally on manila tamarind (Pithecellobium dulce (Roxburgh) Bentham) and one adult was produced on monkeypod (Samanea saman (Jacquin) Merrill). In a biological control program, the mesquite cutworm would complement the damage from other foliage feeders that could be introduced from South America. It could be a candidate for introduction into other countries where mesquite has become a pest, provided that a foliage feeder were the type of control agent wanted.

A total of 988 base pairs (486 for Cytb, and 502 for COI) were aligned for 15 individuals of Maniola and an outgroup, species. The phylogenetic tree obtained through Bayesian inference analysis of the combined data sets shows evidence that the island endemic M. chia is indistinguishable from M jurtina on the basis of the mtDNA genes studied. Net nucleotide divergence between M jurtina and M chia is 0.4%, but 2% between the M jurtina and the M nurag clade. A phenetically distinct entity of individuals from Sardinia appears to be a hybrid between M nurag and M jurtina. The southern and northern European ecotypes of M jurtina, which differ in the summer aestivation period of the southern type, are not structured genetically at the level of coding mtDNA genes. Divergence time between M nurag and M jurtina was estimated to be 1.1 to 1.2 million years. Speciation most likely took place in the early Pleistocene as a consequence of the isolation of Sardinia, when the sea reflooded the Mediterranean basin after the Messinian crisis (about 5 million years ago).

E. Smith), were compared after larvae were fed milk stage spikelets (complete florets) of field-grown converted sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) accessions incorporated into a meridic diet. Larvae fed diet supplemented with spikelets of 'International Sorghum (IS) 12592 Converted (C)' were significantly smaller compared with those fed diet supplemented with spikelets of the released resistant hybrid 'Northrup King Savanna 5'. Feeding on diet containing the genotypes 'IS1340C', IS2246C', 'IS2569C', 'IS7498C', 'IS12617C', or 'IS12683C' resulted in a significantly longer duration of the larval stage of fall armyworm than feeding on diet containing the resistant check NK Savanna 5. Pupal weights of fall armyworm that were fed diet supplemented with 'IS2403C', 'IS2569C', 'IS7498C', 'IS12617C', or 'IS12657C' were significantly less compared with those of fall armyworm fed the resistant check. Weights of fall armyworm larvae were positively correlated with higher concentrations of crude protein (total nitrogen) in sorghum spikelets. The concentrations of lignin were inversely correlated with the duration of the larval development. When resistant and susceptible sorghum genotypes were considered separately, the concentration of tannin and the ratio of lignin/neutral detergent fiber were negatively correlated with the duration of the larval development in the resistant genotypes but positively correlated in the susceptible genotypes.

This pest also damages sugarcane, Saccharum spp. hybrids; corn, Zea mays L.; and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, and feeds on weedy noncrop grasses. Multiple aspects of integrated pest management including use of pheromone traps, manipulation of planting dates, harvest cutting height, stubble management, noncrop host management, soil fertility management, host plant resistance, use of insecticides, and biological control have been studied for Mexican rice borer management. However, the current management strategy in rice primarily relies on the use of chlorantraniliprole insecticide seed treatments. This profile addresses Mexican rice borer biology and management in rice in the United States.	[Beuzelin, J.

Antibiosis, expressed as lower larval weights, was detected in all of the accessions. In addition to being antibiotic, sunflower accession Ames 3291 was antixenotic to banded sunflower moth oviposition and exhibited an additional impact on larval weight when B. thuringiensis was applied. By itself, B. thuringiensis provided better control of banded sunflower moth than the resistance tested. However, banded sunflower moth-resistant sunflower would be a good option when B. thuringiesis or another insecticide is not applied, and it may prevent the economic threshold from being reached.

Smith) is a major pest of maize [Zea mays L. (Poales: Poaceae)] in tropical and subtropical regions. We aimed to evaluate the oviposition preference, growth, and survival of S. frugiperda on maize landraces and assess the nutritional quality of the leaves of different Brazilian maize landraces through evaluation of consumption indices. The oviposition preference was assayed using free and no-choice tests, and antibiosis by evaluating insect growth parameters, including weight, development time, survival in different stages of the life cycle, and nutritional indices. Landrace Prola and cultivar BRS-Caatingueiro were the least preferred for S. frugiperda oviposition. Larvae fed with landrace Prola consumed a lower amount of leaves and showed longer development time and lower survival until the end of the pupal stage. Larvae fed with the leaves of landrace Prola and cultivar BRS-Caatingueiro displayed the lowest nutritional indices. Overall, Prola was the most promising source of resistance to S. frugiperda. Identification of resistance in maize landraces may support breeding programs aimed at developing cultivars and hybrids resistant to S. frugiperda and other agricultural pests and inform growers regarding resistance of their landraces for integrated pest management.

Compared with the blacklight trap, the water-pan trap caught 1.72 times more males in 1990 and 1.97 times more males in 1991. The Heliothis-cone and delta-wing traps, and sweep-net samples were ineffective for male European corn borer. Blacklight traps required significantly more time to sample than any of the pheromone-based traps. A water-pan trap is an effective tool to monitor adult males of the European corn borer in potatoes on Prince Edward Island. In 1992, the mean number of males per pan trap per week was 7.4 for the Iowa strain, 1.1 for the New York strain, 0.6 for the hybrid strain, and 1.1 for an unbaited trap. This suggests that the Iowa strain predominates in the population of European corn borer on Prince Edward Island.

The lowest larval survival, based on the percentage of capitula infested, occurred on H. maximiliani, H. pauciflorus and H. tuberosus. More eggs were laid on the capitula of N. annuus than on other species in multiple-choice trials. In 2-choice tests, H. tuberosus received significantly fewer eggs than H. annuus. Both larval antibiosis and oviposition antixenosis resistance were evident in the perennial sunflower species H. pauciflorous, H. tuberosus, and H. maximiliani. Incorporating germplasm from these species into commercial hybrids could be helpful in reducing costs for the control of the banded sunflower moth.

Comparative susceptibility of Ostrinia furnacalis, Ostrinia nubilalis and Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1 toxins	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Bacillus thuringiensis; Ostrinia furnacalis; Ostrinia nubilalis; Diatraea saccharalis; Comparative patterns of susceptibility	EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; BASE-LINE SUSCEPTIBILITY; DELTA-ENDOTOXIN; HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; DOMAIN-III; RESISTANCE; PYRALIDAE; PROTEIN; GENES; SPECIFICITY	Transgenic corn hybrids that express toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are highly effective against the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), and the closely related Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee). Since the registration of Bt corn hybrids in the U.S. in 1996, there has been a great deal of information generated on O. nubilalis. However, relatively little information exists for O. furnacalis. To help determine whether the information generated for O. nubilalis can be leveraged for decisions regarding the use of transgenic Bt corn against O. furnacalis, experiments were designed to determine whether the pattern of sensitivity to various Bt Cry1 toxins is similar between the two species. Test insects included laboratory-reared O. furnacalis originating from Malaysia, a Bt-susceptible laboratory colony of O. nubilalis maintained at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and an out-group consisting of the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), from Louisiana which represents a different genus from the same family. O. furnacalis and O. nubilalis exhibited a similar pattern of susceptibility to all the Cry1 toxins and were highly susceptible to the range of Bt toxins tested including Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1F. Both of the Ostrinia species were more tolerant to Cry1Ba compared with D. saccharalis, although sensitivity of O. furnacalis was intermediate and did not differ significantly from that of O. nubilalis and D. saccharalis. D. saccharalis was also susceptible to the range of toxins tested but unlike the two Ostrinia species, was more tolerant to Cry1F and more susceptible to Cry1Ba. These results indicate that both of the Ostrinia corn borer species are similar in sensitivity to the Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ba and Cry1F toxins, thus suggesting shared toxin receptors and mechanisms of toxicity for the two species.

Host Plant Association and Genetic Differentiation of Corn and Rice Strains of Spodoptera frugiperda Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Colombia	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Strain; population genetics; pest	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIATION; RACES; POPULATIONS; DISTANCES; SEQUENCE	Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) is a polifagous insect of major economic impact in the western hemisphere and exhibits two strains (i.e., corn and rice) that are morphologically identical but differ in ecology, genetics and physiology. In this work we identified these strains and their respective hybrids by using a PCR-RFLP of the COI gene and PCR of the tandem region FR. Moreover, we performed a population structure analysis by using 253 larvae from Tolima, a region where S. frugiperda is a pest on corn, rice, sorghum and cotton. Corn strain was found on 42% in corn, 34% in cotton, 19% in sorghum and 0.04 % in rice and rice strain on 35% in corn, 0.06% in cotton, 0.06% in sorghum and 53% in rice, demonstrating that corn strain specificity is superior to rice strain. Hybrids between these strains were more abundant in corn. The distributions on their host plants reflect a population genetic differentiation in S. frugiperda with values of PhiPT (COI) = 0.31, P < 0.0001, PhiPT (FR) = 0.17, P < 0.0001 for all crops and PhiPT (COI) = 0.42, P < 0.01, PhiPT (FR) = 0.13, P < 0.01 for the sixteen sampled farms. The dendrograms showed two clusters representing both strains. The results obtained in this study suggest that the management of this insect must differ on each host plant, given the specialization that both strains present, particularly in corn and rice.

Analysis of heterosis and recombination loss for fitness and productivity traits in different hybrids of mulberry silk moth Bombyx mori	ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						crossbreeding; genetics; silkworm	L. HYBRIDS	Three different races of lepidopteron silk moth Bombyx mori were used in reciprocal and inter se crosses to determine heterosis effects at F(1) and recombination loss at the F(2) generation for three fitness traits (fecundity, larval duration, survival rate) and four productivity traits (larval weight, cocoon weight, shell weight, filament length). Eleven mating types were represented in the present study, including three pure breeds and a variety of F(1) and F(2) populations arising from regular and reciprocal crosses, respectively. Equations were derived to evaluate heterosis, maternal and overdominance effects for the above traits. Estimates of heterosis and overdominance effects revealed significant heterosis effects for all the traits, but overdominance was only seen for larval duration (favorable effect) and survival rate (unfavorable effect). Maternal effects were significant for the majority of the traits under study. The results revealed significant reduction for all the quantitative traits from F(1) to F(2), except for larval duration. The most obvious explanation for the reduction of fitness parameters and productive traits is the reduction in heterozygosity from F(1) to F(2) (it is expected that one half of the heterozygosity of F(1) is lost in F(2)). For larval duration this explanation seems insufficient and breakdown of epistatic gene effects (i.e. recombination loss) has been suggested.

The GT-CEW-RS8 synthetic is a breeding population with some resistance to corn earworm, but based on variability for this trait, further improvement was possible in this population. S, recurrent selection for corn earworm resistance was conducted to improve three synthetics derived from GT-CEW-RS8. The objective of this research was to study the effectiveness of these selection programs to increase insect resistance and maintain agronomic performance. Cycles of selection for each population were evaluated under four environments. Significant gains in resistance were realized, but all three synthetics derived from GTCEW-RS8 showed a negative response for yield. However, yield losses were not very dramatic for 66RM4 and inbreeding depression would not affect the yield performance in hybrid combination. Selection for yield done simultaneously with selection for reducing ear damage by corn earworm and husk tightness could assist in avoiding decreased yield.

The studies were based on the examination of genitalia in three serial samplings (total sampling size is 354 specimens: 294 - C. crocea Fourc. males and 60 - C. erate Esp. males Vic Simferopol, 1997-2000) from the same habitat in the forest-steppe Crimea. The outline of the valve margin is considered as a diagnostic criterion for the identification of species. The electrophoretic testing of 12 allozyme loci in two serial samplings (2000 and 2002) showed statistically significant differences between C. crocea and C. erate only in the NadH-dehydrogenase locus. These species differed to a lesser degree in the aldehyde-dehydrogenase locus. Paratypical form (hybrids) of both species differed from C. erate neither by the level of heterozygosity nor by frequencies of rare allels. A genetic model and adaptive importance of polymorphism in C. crocea and C. erate is under discussion.

A large arsenal of plant metabolites is induced by the leafminer feeding including defence compounds that could differ among varieties. Objective To compare the metabolomic changes of different genotypes of tomato (tolerant "T", susceptible "S" and "F1" hybrid obtained between T and S) after exposition to T. absoluta. Methodology Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy followed by multivariate data analysis were performed to analyse the metabolic profiles of control and infested samples on three different tomato genotypes. Results Signals related to GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) were relatively much higher in all infested samples compared to the non-infested plants used as control. Infested T genotype samples were the most abundant in organic acids, including fatty acids and acyl sugars, chlorogenic acid, neo-chlorogenic acid and feruloyl quinic acid, indicating a clear link between the exposure to leafminer. Results also showed an increase of trigonelline in all tomato varieties after exposition to T. absoluta. Conclusion Metabolomics approach based on NMR spectroscopy followed by multivariate data analysis allowed for a detailed metabolite profile of plant defences, providing fundamental information for breeding programmes in plant crops.

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is one of the main plague-insect specie of Brassicaceae plants in Brazil and all over the world. The resistant genotypes use to its control is a promising alternative. This work aimed evaluates the eggs distribution along the plant, the adults' density per plant, and determine the cauliflower genotypes effect in the P. xylostella oviposition. The experiment was carried out at FCAV/UNESP-Jaboticabal Campus Phytossanity Department (Departamento de Fitossanidade). It was evaluated the eggs distribution, the P. xylostella adults density effect using Sharon hybrid, and tests with or without choose choice to determine the P. xylostella nonpreference in the Teresopolis Gigante, Verona, Barcelona, Sharon, Silver Streak, and Piracicaba Precoce genotypes. It is possible conclude that P. xylostella has higher willingness to oviposits in the stem than in the basal leaves. The three couple density of P. xylostella per plant is the best to discriminate cauliflower genotypes regarding the resistance grade to nonpreference choose choice to oviposition. During the P. xylostella oviposition preference tests with choose choice, the genotypes Sharon, Piracicaba Precoce, Barcelona, Verona e Teresopolis Gigante are less desirable to oviposition; while during the no choose choice tests the genotypes did not differ among them.

These microorganisms are pathogenic toward lepidopteran hosts such as Heliothis virescens when introduced by injection of Drosophila tissue extracts and have been given the trivial name DpLE (D. paulistorum lepidopteran entomopathogen). The DpLE from two of the semispecies, Transitional and Andean, were determined to be related to Proteus vulgaris based upon nucleotide sequence comparisons of 16S rDNA genes. Infectivity and 16S rDNA-based PCR assays showed the bacterium to be localized in a number of drosophilid tissues except adult heads and thoraces. Based upon similar experiments, the DpLE in transinfected Heliothis larvae were found in all tissues assayed prior to the onset of mortality. Stocks of Drosophila which had spontaneously lost DpLE continued to produce sterile sons when crossed with incompatible semispecies' females, confirming that the bacilliform DpLE is not the causative agent of the Drosophila paulistorum intersemispecific hybrid male sterility. Acquisition of the sequences of the 16S rDNB molecules of DpLE from all six semispecies permitted the construction of a phylogenetic tree in which the groupings were found not to be congruent with the phylogenies of their insect hosts.

J	Van den Berg, J; Hilbeck, A; Bohn, T				Van den Berg, Johnnie; Hilbeck, Angelika; Bohn, Thomas			Pest resistance to Cry1Ab Bt maize: Field resistance, contributing factors and lessons from South Africa	CROP PROTECTION			English	Review						Bt crops; Cry1Ab; Cry proteins; Insect resistance management; Transgenic maize	INSECT RESISTANCE; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; LEPIDOPTERA-NOCTUIDAE; STEM BORERS; CROPS; SUSTAINABILITY; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; GENETICS; BIOLOGY	This paper documents the historical development of resistance of the African maize stem borer, Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to Bt maize (Zea mays L). This pest was one of the first to evolve resistance to Bt maize expressing Cry1Ab protein. A time-line of events and contributing factors are presented, from the commencement of efficacy testing through to the present situation, where the Cry1Ab toxin has lost its efficacy against B. fusca at many localities throughout the maize producing region, and single-gene Bt maize events often require insecticide treatments for which farmers are compensated. Significant levels of pest survival on Bt maize was observed in the first season after commercial release in 1998 and confirmed seven years later. Reduced selection pressure on the target pest is the objective of insect resistance management (IRM), and strategies to accomplish this should receive highest priority. Where resistance is prevalent, the only viable options to reduce selection pressure are withdrawal of the product and/or enforcement of high-dose/refuge requirements. The latter action may however be of no value under conditions where resistance is prevalent, since the value of refugia to an IRM strategy may be compromised. Remedial actions taken in South Africa included the propagation and enforcement of refuge compliance followed by the release of pyramided maize hybrids in 2011. These pyramids combine Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab2 toxin-producing transgenes, replacing the ineffective single-transgene. However, it remains uncertain if cross-resistance occurs between Cry1A.105/Cry2Ab2 and the closely related Cry1Ab toxin, and for how long this pyramided event will endure. Cultivation of Cry1Ab-expressing hybrids continues in areas where resistance levels have been confirmed to be high. In retrospect, this case provides lessons regarding IRM, not only in South Africa, but wherever Bt crops are being introduced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of drought stress on Mexican rice borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) oviposition preference in sugarcane	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Eoreuma loftini; Free amino acids; Host plant selection; Resistance; Water deficit	EOREUMA-LOFTINI LEPIDOPTERA; AMINO ACID REQUIREMENTS; RIO-GRANDE VALLEY; INVERTEBRATE HERBIVORES; GOSSYPIUM-HIRSUTUM; TEXAS SUGARCANE; WATER-DEFICIT; MOSAIC-VIRUS; SALT STRESS; PYRALIDAE	Two sugarcane, Saccharum hybrids, varieties were grown in the greenhouse under well watered or drought conditions to examine the influences of stress on Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), oviposition preference and selected nutritional components without impinging factors common to field conditions that alter responses. Our research revealed that, under controlled conditions, drought induced a wider range and greater uniformity of free amino acid (FAA) accumulations than have been previously reported. Drought stress resulted in increased dry leaf tissue and elevated concentrations of 7 of 9 detectable free essential (for insect health) amino acids in stalks, the chief food of Mexican rice borer larvae. Stressed sugarcane was preferred for oviposition, likely related to greater numbers of dry leaves and heightened host plant nutritional quality. Dry leaf tissue, which is not consumed, may be a cue for improving chances of larvae encountering nutrient-enhanced living tissue, and for concealing eggs in folds. Excised dry leaf tissue from the treatments was indistinguishable for oviposition preference: therefore, biochemical status of living tissue may provide oviposition cues. Varieties exhibited no major genotypic differences in FAA accumulations or oviposition preference. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

E. Smith) to purified Cry1F protein and corn leaf tissue of 7 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn hybrids and 5 non-Bt corn hybrids was evaluated in the laboratory The 7 Bt corn hybrids represent 5 Bt corn traits: Herculex (R) I, which expresses a single Bt protein (Cry1F), and Genuity (R) VT Double Pro (TM), VT Triple Pro (TM), SmartStax (TM), and Agrisure (R) Viptera (TM) 3111, which contain a >= 2 pyramided Bt genes. The original FL and PR populations were collected from corn fields in 2011 in Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively. Diet-incorporation bioassays showed that FL was susceptible to Cry1F protein with a LC50 value of 0.13-0.23 mu g/g, while PR was highly resistant to Cry1F protein (> 137-fold). FL was also susceptible to all 7 Bt corn hybrids with a 7-day mortality of > 95%, while PR and a backcrossed and reselected population, Cry1F-RR, were highly resistant to Cry1F corn leaf tissue. The resistance was recessive or incompletely recessive. None of the 5 populations of S. frugiperda could survive on Viptera (TM) 3111, suggesting this Bt corn trait can completely overcome the resistance and thus should provide a means of managing Cry1F resistance in S. frugiperda. However, Cry1F-RR exhibited a significant cross-resistance to the leaf tissue of the other 3 pyramided Bt corn traits. The possible cross-resistance between single-gene and pyramided Bt corn products suggest that careful selection of Bt genes is essential in use of gene pyramiding strategy for resistance management.

The pink stem borer, Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre, is an important constraint for the maize crop in Mediterranean regions. The objective of this work was to identify a "flint X flint" beterotic pattern that would perform well under artificial infestation by S. nonagrioides. A 10-population diallel was evaluated under infestation by S. nonagrioides in 2 yr. Variety effects were the only significant effects involved in stem and ear resistance to S. nonagrioides attack. Variety effects and average heterosis effects were the only significant effects for grain yield under artificial infestation conditions. Considering variety effects and cross-performance, the beterotic pattern Basto/Enano levantixo X Longfellow (BA/EL X LO) would be recommended for obtaining flint maize hybrids tolerant to S. nonagrioides attack because BA/EL had the most favorable variety effects for stem resistance, LO exhibited the most positive variety effects for grain yield, and the cross BA/EL X LO, yielded significantly more than the remaining crosses.

Screening for nutrigenetic traits in silkworm, Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) is an essential prerequisite for better understanding and development of nutritionally efficient breeds/hybrids, which show less food consumption with higher efficiency conversion. The aim of this study was to identify nutritionally efficient polyvoltine silkworm strains using the germplasm breeds RMW2, RMW3, RMW4, RMG(3), RMG(1), RMG(4), RMG(5), RMG(6) and APM(1) as the control. The 1st day of 5th stage silkworm larvae of polyvoltine strains were subjected to standard gravimetric analysis until spinning for three consecutive generations covering 3 different seasons on 19 nutrigenetic traits. Highly significant (p <= 0.001) differences were found among all nutrigenetic traits of polyvoltine silkworm strains in the experimental groups. The nutritionally efficient polvoltine silkworm strains were resulted by utilizing nutrition consumption index and efficiency of conversion of ingesta/cocoon traits as the index. Higher nutritional efficiency conversions were found in the polyvoltine silkworm strains on efficiency of conversion of ingesta to cocoon and shell than control. Comparatively smaller consumption index, respiration, metabolic rate with superior relative growth rate, and quantum of food ingesta and digesta requisite per gram of cocoon and shell were found; the lowest amount was in new polyvoltine strains compared to the control. Furthermore, based on the overall nutrigenetic traits utilized as index or 'biomarkers', three polyvoltine silkworm strains (RMG(4), RMW2, and RMW3) were identified as having the potential for nutrition efficiency conversion. The data from the present study advances our knowledge for the development of nutritionally efficient silkworm breeds/hybrids and their effective commercial utilization in the sericulture industry.

In addition to differences in the habitus and some genitalic traits, the three species show a temporal shift in their female sexual activity. They also differ by the ratio of two main compounds in their pheromone glands. Under laboratory conditions, hybrids can be obtained but the mating rates depend on the crosses.

The F-2 screening method involved (i) collecting larvae from maize fields; (ii) establishing two-parent families; (iii) screening F-2 neonates for survival on Bt-maize leaf tissues; and (iv) confirming resistance on commercial Bt-maize plants. With the F-2 screening method, 213 isoline families of D. saccharalis were established from field collections in northeast Louisiana, USA and were screened for Bt resistance. One family was confirmed to carry a major Bt resistance allele(s). In a laboratory bioassay, larval mortality of the Bt-resistant D. saccharalis on Bt-maize leaf tissues was significantly lower than that of a Bt-susceptible strain. This Bt-resistant D. saccharalis population is the first corn stalk borer species that has completed larval development on commercial Bt-maize. The F-2 screening protocol developed in this study could be modified for detecting Bt resistance alleles in other similar corn stalk borers, such as the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), and the southwestern corn borer, D. grandiosella Dyar.

The pattern of distribution and the degree of diversification between lineages originated by isolation in different glacial refugia usually depends on ecological traits, especially to their dispersal ability. Zerynthia polyxena is a philopatric species, scattered in small populations and rarely colonizing mountain areas. These characteristics probably caused repeated isolation during the Quaternary and may have favoured diversification. Actually two studies, based on both morphological and genetic data, suggest the existence of two highly distinct lineages in Europe having in Northern Italy their contact zone. In this study, I applied geometric morphometrics to male genitalia and demonstrated that (i) two morphotypes exist in Europe approximately facing on the two sides of the Po River; (ii) the two lineages probably survived glaciations in Italy and the Balkan Peninsula, respectively; then the Balkans lineage expanded to Central and Eastern Europe; (iii) no hybrid populations seem to exist in the contact area and, in one locality at least, the two lineages live in sympatry without any evidence of intermediates. These results suggest that (i) two sister species of Zerynthia exist in Europe. Accordingly, Papilio cassandra Geyer, 1828 is reinstated, as Zerynthia cassandra stat. rev., as the species to which the Zerynthia from Italy South of the Po River belong. Male genitalia differences with Zerynthia polyxena are described.

E. Smith), neonates has been developed and released. Laboratory studies were conducted over 2 yr to determine if this resistance extends to older larvae initially fed susceptible leaf tissue and if larvae initially fed resistant leaf tissue recover when switched to similar susceptible tissue. Our results indicate a resistance and a recovery response by larvae of both species, depending on leaf tissue feeding regime. Southwestern corn borer larvae fed susceptible tissue for 3 or 7 d before switching to resistant tissue gained significantly less weight after the switch than those fed on only susceptible tissue. In contrast, southwestern corn borer larvae fed resistant tissue for 3 or 7 d before switching to susceptible tissue gained significantly more weight after the switch than those fed resistant tissue only. Similar results were observed for the fall armyworm. An interesting response occurred with fall armyworm larvae fed resistant tissue after being initially fed susceptible tissue for 7 d. Although the larvae gained less weight after the tissue switch than those reared only on susceptible tissue, the number of days to pupation did not differ. However, the resulting pupae weighed only 138.5 mg compared with 182.1 mg for those reared on only susceptible tissue. Our findings provide evidence that resistance to later instars does occur in maize and useful information when considering using a mixture of resistant and susceptible seed as an integrated pest management strategy.

Two key issues require resolution: (i) how many species of Aricia occur in north-western Europe and what are their distributions?; (ii) how is the morphological variation observed in north-western Europe best explained? We investigated phylogenetic relationships and phylogeographic patterns in this species group using mitochondrial and nuclear markers in comparison with morphological variation. A 325 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene was sequenced from 179 individuals representing 18 populations from the UK and Scandinavia. Seventeen enzyme-coding loci were analysed from 538 individuals from the same populations. Highly congruent phylogenies between mitochondrial and allozyme markers demonstrate that the sample is composed of two closely related species, A. agestis and A. artaxerxes. Both marker types also suggest that Scottish and northern Scandinavian A. artaxerxes populations are conspecific, and consequently do not support the endemic status of A. artaxerxes in the UK. The subspecies division of British populations of A. artaxerxes is also not supported by phylogenetic analyses. Allozyme and mitochondrial analyses cluster two populations from the Peak District, UK, differently. The former suggests that they are A. artaxerxes whilst the latter suggests they are A. agestis. Further research is required to find the reason for this disagreement, which could be associated with the different dynamics of nuclear and mitochondrial genes across a hybrid zone between the two species.

Intraear Compensation of Field Corn, Zea mays, from Simulated and Naturally Occurring Injury by Ear-Feeding Larvae	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						corn; corn earworm; Helicoverpa zea; simulated injury; compensation	SUGARCANE BORER LEPIDOPTERA; SOUTHERN UNITED-STATES; EARWORM LEPIDOPTERA; FALL ARMYWORM; HELICOVERPA-ZEA; GRAIN-YIELD; NOCTUIDAE; TEMPERATURE; RESISTANCE; CRAMBIDAE	Ear-feeding larvae, such as corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), can be important insect pests of field corn, Zea mays L., by feeding on kernels. Recently introduced, stacked Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) traits provide improved protection from ear-feeding larvae. Thus, our objective was to evaluate how injury to kernels in the ear tip might affect yield when this injury was inflicted at the blister and milk stages. In 2010, simulated corn earworm injury reduced total kernel weight (i.e., yield) at both the blister and milk stage. In 2011, injury to ear tips at the milk stage affected total kernel weight. No differences in total kernel weight were found in 2013, regardless of when or how much injury was inflicted. Our data suggested that kernels within the same ear could compensate for injury to ear tips by increasing in size, but this increase was not always statistically significant or sufficient to overcome high levels of kernel injury. For naturally occurring injury observed on multiple corn hybrids during 2011 and 2012, our analyses showed either no or a minimal relationship between number of kernels injured by ear-feeding larvae and the total number of kernels per ear, total kernel weight, or the size of individual kernels. The results indicate that intraear compensation for kernel injury to ear tips can occur under at least some conditions.	[Steckel, S.; Stewart, S.

Responses of Parasitoids to Volatiles Induced by Chilo partellus Oviposition on Teosinte, a Wild Ancestor of Maize	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Induced defense; oviposition; plant volatiles; tritrophic interactions; crop wild relative	EGG DEPOSITION; INSECT; PLANTS; HYMENOPTERA; VARIABILITY; BRACONIDAE; MANAGEMENT; RESISTANCE; EVOLUTION; VARIETIES	Maize, a genetically diverse crop, is the domesticated descendent of its wild ancestor, teosinte. Recently, we have shown that certain maize landraces possess a valuable indirect defense trait not present in commercial hybrids. Plants of these landraces release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that attract both egg [Trichogramma bournieri Pintureau & Babault (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)] and larval [Cotesia sesamiae Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)] parasitoids in response to stemborer egg deposition. In this study, we tested whether this trait also exists in the germplasm of wild Zea species. Headspace samples were collected from plants exposed to egg deposition by Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) moths and unexposed control plants. Four-arm olfactometer bioassays with parasitic wasps, T. bournieri and C. sesamiae, indicated that both egg and larval parasitoids preferred HIPVs from plants with eggs in four of the five teosinte species sampled. Headspace samples from oviposited plants released higher amounts of EAG-active compounds such as (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. In oviposition choice bioassays, plants without eggs were significantly preferred for subsequent oviposition by moths compared to plants with prior oviposition. These results suggest that this induced indirect defence trait is not limited to landraces but occurs in wild Zea species and appears to be an ancestral trait. Hence, these species possess a valuable trait that could be introgressed into domesticated maize lines to provide indirect defense mechanisms against stemborers.

In this study, performance of five populations of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), were evaluated on four non-Bt and eight commercial and experimental Bt maize hybrids/lines (hereafter referred as maize products). The five insect populations included one Cry1A.105-susceptible strain, two Cry1A.105-resistant strains, and two F-1 heterozygous genotypes. The eight Bt maize hybrids/lines consisted of five single-gene Bt maize products containing Cry1A.105, Cry2Ab2, Cry1F, or CrylAb protein, and three pyramided Bt maize products expressing Cry1A.105/Cry2Ab2, Cry1A.105/Cry2Ab2/Cry1F, or Cry1A13/Vip3A for targeting aboveground lepidopteran maize pests. In the study, neonates of each population were tested on leaf tissues in the laboratory and whole plants in the greenhouse. Cry1A.105 and Cry1F maize killed 92.2-100% susceptible larvae in both test methods, while resistant larvae survived well on these two maize products. Performance of the two F1 populations on Cry1A.105 and Ciy1F maize varied between the two test methods. In leaf tissue bioassay, CrylAb maize was marginally effective against the susceptible population. In contrast, few live larvae and little leaf injury from any of the five populations were observed on Cry2Ab2 and the three pyramided Bt maize products. The results of this study showed evidence of cross resistance of the Cry1A.105-resistant S. frugiperda to Cry1F and CrylAb maize, but not to the Bt maize products containing Cry2Ab2 or Vip3A. Data generated from this study will be useful in developing resistance management strategies for the sustainable use of Bt maize technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Risk is affected by potentially interacting factors of maize genetics, ear feeding with insects, fungal inoculum and growth, and weather (rainfall, temperature, and humidity). This review gives special attention to integration of the most efficient pest and disease management strategy combinations and the potential interaction of insect ear feeding and A. flavus occurrence. Management strategies reviewed include maximizing partial genetic resistance to A. flavus and selection of appropriate hybrids for the area, biological control of A. flavus using non-aflatoxigenic strains, avoiding pests and diseases using cultural practices like early planting, and reducing H. zea and S. frugiperda ear injury using Bt transgenes. Understanding the combined influences and identifying combined management approaches may lead to reduced aflatoxin risk and maintaining yield.This review focuses on subtropical areas of North America because the amount of maize produced in warm environments within or similar to subtropical maize production areas is likely to increase due to projected increases in demand for maize and predicted increases in temperature may increase pest and disease risk.

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), (homozygous Cry1Ac-susceptibile, Cry1Ac-resistant, and their F1 hybrids), on transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) broccoli expressing different levels of Cry1Ac protein were evaluated in laboratory. These Bt broccoli lines were designated as relative low, medium, and high, respectively, according to the Cry1Ac content. Untransformed brocccoli plants were used as control. Larval survival of diamondback moth on non-Bt leaves was not significantly different among the three genotypes. The Cry1Ac-resistant larvae could survive on the low level of Bt broccoli plants, while Cry1Ac-susceptible and F1 larvae could not survive on them. The three genotypes of P. xylostella larvae could not survive on medium and high levels of Bt broccoli. In oviposition choice tests, there was no significant difference in the number of eggs laid by the three P. xylostella genotypes among different Bt broccoli plants. The development of Cry1Ac-susceptible and Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella on intact Bt plants was also tested in greenhouse. All susceptible P. xylostella larvae died on all Bt plants, while resistant larvae could survive on broccoli, which expresses low Cry1Ac protein under greenhouse conditions. The results of the greenhouse trials were similar to that of laboratory tests. This study indicated that high dose of Bt toxins in broccoli cultivars or germplasm lines is required for effective resistance management.

The butterfly Heliconius numata Cramer (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae; Heliconiinae) is both polymorphic and aposematic. The polymorphism is due to variation at a single locus (or 'supergene') which determines colour patterns involved in Mullerian mimicry. We sampled 11 sites in a small area (approx. 60x30km) of North-eastern Peru for H. numata and its co-mimics in the genus Melinaea and Athyrtis (Ithomiinae), and examined the role of temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the maintenance of polymorphism. Colour-patterns of Melinaea communities, which constitute the likely 'mimetic environment' for H. numata, are differentiated on a more local scale than morphs of H. numata, but the latter do show a strong and significant response to local selection for colour-pattern. In contrast, analysis of enzyme polymorphism in H. numata across the region revealed no spatial structure, which is consistent with a high mobility of this species. Differences in spatial variability in the two taxa may have caused H. numata to become polymorphic, while temporal variability, not significant in this study, probably has a lesser effect. The mimetic polymorphism is therefore explained by means of multiple selection-migration clines at a single locus, a similar process to that which explains narrow hybrid zones between geographic races of other Heliconius butterflies.

J	Sharma, HC; Sullivan, D				Sharma, HC; Sullivan, D			Screening for plant resistance to oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) in pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Oriental armyworm; Mythimna separata; pearl millet; host plant resistance; screening techniques; Pennisetum glaucum		Pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum (R.Br.) L., is an important crop in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa. It is damaged by several insects of which the Oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Walker), is an important pest in Asia, and also in Australia. Chemical control is not possible for resource-poor farmers in the semiarid tropics, thus host plant resistance assumes a central role in pest management. We evaluated a set of 40 pearl millet landraces under choice and no-choice conditions to identify Lines with resistance to this insect. Genotypes IP 6577, PIE 228, IP 6069, IP 6251, and IP 5836 were significantly less damaged than the susceptible check IP 3072. These lines can be used to develop cultivars with less susceptibility to M. separata. Most of the lines showing resistance to the Oriental armyworm originated from West Africa. Hybrids based on the male-sterile line 111A were less susceptible under field conditions than those based on 5141A and 5054A, suggesting that there are possibilities for reducing armyworm damage through development and use of cultivars with resistance to this pest.

Development of marker-free transgenic pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) expressing a pod borer insecticidal protein	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CONFERS RESISTANCE; TRANSFORMATION; EXCISION; CRY1AC; CRY2AA; GENE	Pigeon pea, a grain legume of the semiarid tropics, is a rich source of high-quality protein. The productivity of this pulse is seriously affected by lepidopteron insect pests. To generate a sustainable insect-resistant plant, synthetically prepared bioactive key constituents of a crystal protein (Syn Cry1Ab) of Bacillus thuringiensis were expressed in pigeon pea under the guidance of a tissue-specific promoter of the RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit (rbcS) gene. Regenerated transgenic plants with the cry1Ab expression cassette (cry1Ab-lox-bar-lox) showed the optimum insect motility rate (90%) in an in vitro insect bioassay with second instar larvae, signifying the insecticidal potency of Syn Cry1Ab. In parallel, another plant line was also generated with a chimaeric vector harbouring a cre recombinase gene under the control of the CaMV 2x35S promoter. Crossing between T-1 plants with a single insertion of cry1Ab-lox-bar-lox T-DNA and T-1 plants with moderate expression of a cre gene with a linked hygromycin resistance (hptII) gene was performed to exclude the bialaphos resistance (bar) marker gene. Excision of the bar gene was achieved in T1F1 hybrids, with up to 35.71% recombination frequency. Insect-resistant pigeon pea plants devoid of selectable marker genes (syn Cry1Ab- bar and cre-hptII) were established in a consecutive generation (T1F2) through genetic segregation.

Advanced hybrid potato clones (donor species: Solanum berthaultii Hawkes) and their parents were evaluated for resistance to the potato tuber moth (PTM) and examined for several biochemical, molecular and physical traits in order to investigate the mechanisms which underlie PTM-resistance. Resistant parent recorded 57% of mortality of pupae in comparison to the 23% observed in the susceptible parent. Expression patterns of specific genes involved in the phenolic biosynthetic pathway show that hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT) and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) reflect chlorogenic and caffeic acid levels in the skin of all the genotypes (0.7 <= r <= 1.0). Skin alpha-chaconine and skin caffeic acid strongly and significantly related with PTM larval mortality (r(2)=0.99 and r=0.90, respectively). This study suggests that skin alpha-chaconine and skin caffeic acid could play a defensive role against PTM and proposes a PTM resistant clone with high level of these bio-compounds, useful in breeding projects for plant defense and nutritional value purposes.

Given the overlap in wing-patterns, habitat selection, and geographic distribution of various Maniola species, genitalia morphology is sometimes the only possibility to tell specimen apart. In this paper we describe diagnostic characters to distinguish different Maniola species by means of their genitalia. Included is also the first detailed description and illustration of the genitalia apparatus of the Sardinian endemic Maniola nurag. Further, we describe two Sardinian individuals with intermediate characteristics between Maniola nurag and Maniola jurtina, and propose that they are hybrids. Further, we shortly discuss the justification of the species status for the island endemics Maniola chia and Maniola cypricola.

A previous study of Bt corn engineered with Monsanto event 810 failed to detect an effect of pollen exposure on the black swallowtail, Papilio polyxenes, in either the field or the laboratory. Here, we report results of a field study investigating the impact of exposure to pollen from a Bt corn hybrid containing Novartis event 176 on two species of Lepidoptera, black swallowtails and monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus. Nearly half of the 600 monarch larvae died within the first 24 h; this and subsequent mortality was not associated with proximity to St corn and may have been due in part to predation. Survivorship of black swallowtails was much higher than that of the monarchs and was also independent of proximity to the transgenic corn. However, despite five rainfall events that removed much of the pollen from the leaves of their host plants during the experiment, we observed a significant reduction in growth rates of black swallowtail larvae that was likely caused by pollen exposure. These results suggest that Bt corn incorporating event 176 can have adverse sublethal effects on black swallowtails in the field and underscore the importance of event selection in reducing environmental impacts of transgenic plants.

This insect has three major digestive alpha-amylases with isoelectric points 5.30, 5.70 and 5.98, respectively, which were separated using native and isoelectric focusing gels. The alpha-amylase activity has an optimum pH between 7.0 and 10.0 with a peak at pH 9.0. The enzymes are stable when heated to 50 degrees C and were inhibited by proteinaceous inhibitors from Phaseolus coccineus (70% inhibition) and P. vulgaris cv. Radical (87% inhibition) at pH 6.0. The inhibitors present in all amaranth hybrid inhibited 80% of the activity at pH 9.0. The results show that the alpha-amylase inhibitor from amaranth seeds may be a better candidate to make genetically-modified potatoes resistant to this insect than inhibitors from common bean seeds.

In 2003, Agrosavia began the identification and selection of potato genotypes from the Central Colombian Collection (CCC) for T. solanivora resistance. In 2013 reciprocal diallelic crosses were carried out between commercial varieties and the Guatemalan moth resistant native genotypes. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of potato hybrids obtained from crosses, on T. solanivora demographic parameters under laboratory conditions. Five genotypes and two commercial varieties were evaluated in a non-choice trial, through the development of a life table with two consecutive cohorts. Genotypes 4-69, 23-31 and Perla Negra (PN) were found to cause the highest larval mortality (90, 98 and 98%); 23-31 and PN did not allow adults development. In genotypes 4-69 and 23-31, the net reproductive rate (Ro) (3.92 and 4.38) and the intrinsic rate of natural growth (rm) (0.030 and 0.035) decreased, and the initial population doubling time (TD) increased significantly (18,14 and 19,35). These results suggest that three of the evaluated genotypes could have attributes of resistance to T. solanivora due to the antibiosis mechanism by affecting its biology. This study contributes to the search for materials with resistance to the Guatemalan moth, a line of research for potato breeding in Colombia.

Preference for isolated host plants facilitates invasion of Danaus chrysippus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) by a bacterial male-killer Spiroplasma	AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						cannibalism; enemy-free space; oviposition behaviour; sex ratio; sibling competition	EAST-AFRICA; HYBRID ZONE; COLOR GENES; FOOD PLANT; SEX-RATIOS; L.; POLYMORPHISM; PLEXIPPUS; POPULATION; MORTALITY	Matrilinearly inherited endosymbiotic bacteria are estimated to occur in a third of all terrestrial arthropods. They include male killers, which are typically associated with organisms that lay their eggs in batches. Batch laying favours male-killing bacteria because infected female larvae can cannibalise dead brothers and do not have to compete with them for larval resources. This paper tackles the paradox of high male-killer infection rates in Danaus chrysippus (Linnaeus, 1758), a butterfly that lays its eggs singly rather than in batches, making the selective advantage of male killing for the bacterium hard to understand. The study was conducted in the Nairobi region of Kenya where two substantially allopatric but seasonally migratory semispecies of Danaus chrysippus overlap and hybridise. Within this hybrid zone, but apparently not outside it, D.chrysippus hosts the endosymbiotic male killer, Spiroplasma ixodetis. In Nairobi, this bacterium can infect up to 95% of females. Semispecies D.chrysippus chrysippus and its hybrid with D.chrysippus dorippus (form transiens) are heavily infected, unlike the parental pure D.chrysippus dorippus semispecies, which may be protected by a suppressor gene. We find that: (1) adult females oviposit preferentially on isolated host plants; (2) female larvae on isolated plants survive better than on plants growing in clumps; (3) female larvae survive in greater numbers on plants removed to the laboratory compared to plants left outside; (4) high Spiroplasma infection favours female survival; and (5) high egg/larval density adversely affects adult body size. We conclude that: (1) the butterflies' preference for isolated host plants creates high egg densities and hence enables invasion by Spiroplasma; (2) male killing favours female survival through cannibalism of male eggs and the extra food-plant resources so released; and (3) the butterfly's preference for isolated host plants may provide an enemy-free space that protects eggs and larvae from predators and parasitoids.

However, due to the lack of a transformer gene, AS regulation of doublesex remains unclear in Lepidoptera, which contain the economically important silkworm Bombyx mori and thousands of agricultural pests. Here, we use yeast three-hybrid system to screen for RNA-binding proteins that recognize sex-specific exons 3 and 4 of silkworm doublesex (Bm-dsx); this approach identified BxRBP1/Lark binding to the exon 3, and BxRBP2/TBPH and BxRBP3/Aret binding to the exon 4. Investigation of tissues shows that BxRBP1 and BxRBP2 have no sex specificity, but BxRBP3 has - three of its four isoforms are expressed with a sex-bias. Using novel sex-specific silkworm cell lines, we find that BxRBP1 and BxRBP3 directly interact with each other, and cooperatively function as splicing repressors. Over-expression of BxRBP1 and BxRBP3 isoforms efficiently inhibits splicing of the exons 3 and 4 in the female-specific cells and generates the male-specific isoform of Bm-dsx. We also demonstrate that the sex-determination upstream gene Masc regulates alternatively transcribed BxRBP3 isoforms. Thus, we identify a new regulatory mechanism of doublesex AS in the silkworm, revealing an evolutionary divergence in insect sex-determination.

It has been suggested that these species merged into several hybrid swarm populations, although a mitochondrial phylogeography revealed substructure with local differentiation. We analysed a three-gene mt-dataset (889 individuals) and 12 microsatellite loci (892 individuals). Microsatellite analyses revealed an overall weak differentiation and corroborated the superordinate division into two clusters. The data indicate that the populations studied belong to only one species according to the biological species concept, refuting the opening hypothesis. A future taxonomic revision appears necessary to reflect the division into two subgroups. Ancestral mitochondrial polymorphisms are retained in H. euphorbiae, indicating gene flow within a broad 'glacial refuge belt' and ongoing postglacial gene flow. Diverse patterns of extensive mito-nuclear discordance in the Mediterranean and the Middle East presumably evolved by more recent processes. This discordance indicates introgression of H. tithymali-related mitochondrial haplogroups, accompanied (to a lesser degree) by nuclear alleles, into Italian and Aegean H. euphorbiae populations as recently as the late Holocene. The complex mosaic of divergence and reintegration is assumed to have been influenced by locally differing environmental barriers to gene flow.

The objective of this work was to study the resistance of the four early maturing varieties of sweet corn, Baby Orchard, Orchard Baby, Dorinny Sweet, and Golden Early Market, and to check the relationship among resistance to S. nonagrioides and infestation dates. In a previous study, these varieties had showed a confusing behavior, being the most resistant varieties to S. nonagrioides attack in some environments and the most susceptible in others. These varieties were again evaluated along with three medium maturing varieties, used as testers because they were more stable in both environments, by using two infestation dates. Plants were more damaged in the late infestation, but the effect of the infestation depends on the variety studied. Orchard Baby and Baby Orchard were the most resistant varieties under two infestation dates. These two varieties are closely related. Therefore, we can use either one as a source of precocity and resistance for modern sweet corn. Although many studies showed that early maturing inbreds had greater damage caused by S. nonagrioides and European corn borer than late maturing inbreds and hybrids, our results showed that the earliest maturing varieties were the most resistant.

Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) egg masses were analyzed in four sweet corn hybrids planted across four planting dates from 1994 to 1996. From the five-leaf to 15-leaf vegetative stages, the mean leaf position of an egg mass was typically at the midpoint of available (nonsenescent) leaves. The mean leaf position of egg masses gradually increased from early to late leaf stages as new leaves were added and continued to increase during die first reproductive stage (green tassel). The increase in vertical position during vegetative stages was modeled as y = -0.766 + 0.653(x), where y = nodal leaf position, and x = total leaves expanded (r(2) = 0.94). However,when the mean egg mass position was expressed as the mean position within available (expanded and nonsenescent) leaves: no relationship was found. These data indicate that during, vegetative stages the mean egg mass position increases relative to ground level, but remains near the midpoint of available available (nonsenescent) leaves. Mean egg position during the nest four reproductive stages (anthesis. green silk, brown silk, and postharvest) stabilized at ear height, or within the inlrrlediate two leaf positions above the ear. The distributions of egg masses among leaf positions during the vegetative and reproductive stages generally exhibited normal distributions: where sample sizes were sufficient, 80% (17/21) of the comparisons (having sufficient sample sizes) did not deviate from normality. This study represents the most detailed examination to date on vertical distribution of European corn borer egg masses in corn. Implications of the study in ovipositional ecology and pest management are discussed.

The inheritance of ear resistance in field corn to this pest has not been studied. This work aims to determine the importance of genetic (additive, dominance, and epistatic effects) and environmental effects in the inheritance of ear resistance to S. nonagrioides. Three field corn inbreds (CM109, EP31, and EP42) were used as parents and two crosses (CM109 X EP31 and CM109 X EP42) were made. These inbreds show different ear resistance levels to S. nonagrioides, with CM109 more resistant than EP31 and EP42. For each cross, parents (P-1, P-2), F-1, F-2, and backcrosses to each parent (BC1 and BC2) were evaluated. Correlations among ear damage traits showed that general appearance of the ear should be useful indicator of ear resistance. Ear resistance was dominant to susceptibility and was transmitted from inbreds to their hybrids. the additive-dominance model fit the generation mean analysis for both crosses and the degree of genetic control varied depending on the cross and trait. For both crosses, additive and dominance effects were significant for most ear damage traits. Epistatic gene effects were significant for husk and shank damage, and gene effects for number and length of tunnels were not significant. Because ear resistance involved additive and dominance effects for this set of inbreds, breeding procedures based on both types of gene action should be effective.

Although differences in infestation levels of D. saccharalis caused by arthropod predation were not detected in the fall, significantly greater numbers of deadhearts occurred in the spring where predators were suppressed. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), was the dominant predator in these studies. Incorporating a covariable representing the number of larvae infesting sugarcane stalks in the fall did not adequately account for the variation in sugarcane shoots with deadhearts. Results from this study indicate that, in addition to the anticipated effect of cultivar resistance and predation on the stalk damage caused by D. saccharalis during the growing season, substantial reductions in the incidence of spring deadhearts can also be expected. The effect of-cultivar resistance and arthropod predation of D. saccharalis on deadhearts is additive.

For susceptible and resistant strains tested on artificial diet, increases in Cry1Ac concentration reduced developmental rate and pupal weight. In greenhouse tests, survival of resistant larvae on transgenic cotton that produces Cry1Ac (Bt cotton) was 46% relative to their survival on non-Bt cotton. In contrast, Bt cotton killed all susceptible larvae tested. F, hybrid progeny of resistant and susceptible adults did not survive on Bt cotton, which indicates recessive inheritance of resistance. Compared with resistant or susceptible larvae reared on non-Bt cotton, resistant larvae reared on Bt cotton had lower survival and slower development, and achieved lower pupal weight and fecundity. Recessive resistance to Bt cotton is consistent with one of the basic assumptions of the refuge strategy for delaying resistance to Bt cotton. Whereas slower development of resistant insects on Bt cotton could increase the probability of mating between resistant adults and accelerate resistance, negative effects of Bt cotton on the survival and development of resistant larvae could delay evolution of resistance.

A diurnal trapping study conducted in central Kentucky during late summer/early autumn revealed that flight activity of males is concentrated almost exclusively at dusk (between 1700 and 2200 hours), but the window of flight activity can be shifted by meteorological conditions. Pheromone traps placed in plots of maize varying with respect to planting date and hybrid and in plots of sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., revealed that mere presence of tall vegetation increases local activity of male S. cerealella, and that maize-specific characteristics, probably volatile chemicals, further localize flight activity. Implications of this knowledge of S. cerealella behaviour for management of the pest are discussed.

E. Smith, 1797) is a polyphagous pest of global relevance due to the damage it inflicts on agricultural crops. In South American countries, this species is one of the principal pests of maize and cotton. Currently, S. frugiperda is also emerging as an important pest of soybeans and winter cereals in Brazil. Chemical control is one of the main control tactics against S. frugiperda, even though resistance against numerous modes of action insecticides has been reported. To support insect resistance management programs, we evaluated the fitness costs of resistance of S. frugiperda to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor chlorpyrifos. Fitness costs were quantified by comparing biological parameters of chlorpyrifos-resistant and -susceptible S. frugiperda and their F-1 hybrids (heterozygotes) on non-Bt cotton, non-Bt maize, non-Bt soybean, and oats. The results revealed that the chlorpyrifos-resistant genotype showed lower pupa-to-adult and egg-to-adult survivorship and reduced larval weights on oats; longer neonate-to-pupa and egg-to-adult developmental periods, and lower pupal weights and fecundity on maize; lower pupal weights on soybean; and reduced fecundity on cotton compared with the chlorpyrifos-susceptible genotype. Fitness costs also affected fertility life table parameters of the resistant genotype, increasing the mean length of a generation on cotton and maize and reducing the potential for population growth on all hosts. These findings suggest fitness costs at the individual and population levels of chlorpyrifos resistance in S. frugiperda, indicating that removal of the selective agent from the environment would result in reduced resistance and opportunities for the restoration of susceptibility.

These parameters included larval development and its dynamics, adult emergence, mean development duration (MDD) and fecundity. Since the larvae are the developmental stage that causes the most damage on maize, additional data on larval development helps identify conditions that promote development. The results of our study indicate that broken maize kernels are the most suitable for P. interpunctella development, where the most successful larval development, the highest number of emerged adults, the shortest MDD and the highest total fecundity were recorded. On the contrary, whole kernels were the least suitable and the most resistant to infestation by P. interpunctella. The type of kernel also significantly affects P. interpunctella developmental parameters. Females reared on flint kernels (the hardest kernel type tested in our study) laid the largest total number of eggs, which implies that kernel hardness, i.e. the type of kernel should be an important parameter when choosing maize hybrids for cultivation and for storage. Our study warrants further investigation of maize types and their susceptibility to P. interpunctella. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wing pattern evolution and the origins of mimicry among North American admiral butterflies (Nymphalidae : Limenitis)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						mimicry; wing pattern evolution; host-plant shift; molecular phylogeny; Lepidoptera; limenitis; admiral butterflies	NATURAL-SELECTION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; WARNING-COLOR; LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIATION; HELICONIUS; PHYLOGENY; HISTORY; VICEROY; ADAPTATION	The evolution of wing pattern diversity in butterflies has emerged as a model system for understanding the origins and maintenance of adaptive phenotypic novelty. Admiral butterflies (genus Limenitis) are an attractive system for studying wing pattern diversity because mimicry is common among the North American species and hybrid zones occur wherever mimetic and non-mimetic wing pattern races meet. However, the utility of this system has been limited because the evolutionary relationships among these butterflies remain unclear. Here I present a robust species-level phylogeny of Limenitis based on 1911 bp of two mitochondrial genes (COI and COII) and 904 bp of EF1-alpha for all five of the Nearctic species/wing pattern races, the majority of the Palearctic species, and three outgroup genera; Athyma, Moduza (Limenitidini), and Neptis (Limenitidinae: Neptini). Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses indicate that the North American species are a well-supported, monophyletic lineage that is most closely related to the widespread, Palearctic, Poplar admiral (L. populi). Within North America, the Viceroy (L. archippus) is the basal lineage while the relationships among the remaining species are not well resolved. A combined maximum-likelihood analysis, however, indicates that the two western North America species (L. lorquini and L. weidemeyerii) are sister taxa and closely related to the wing pattern subspecies of the polytypic Limenitis arthemis species complex. These results are consistent with (1) an ancestral host-shift to Salicaceae by the common ancestor of the Poplar admiral and the Nearctic admiral lineage, (2) a single colonization of the Nearctic, and (3) a subsequent radiation of the North American forms leading to at least three independent origins of mimicry.

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)]. Since its first detection outside of its native range in 2016, FAW has spread into 76 nations across Africa and Asia adversely affecting maize production and, in turn, the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers. Thus, there is a strong need for the development of cost-effective and biologically based integrated pest management (IPM) practices including host-plant resistance (HPR). However, most of the commercial maize cultivars have lost some defensive traits through selective breeding for yield during domestication. The majority of the commercially cultivated hybrids and cultivars in Asia and Africa are highly susceptible to FAW. Therefore, this review summarizes information about various maize landraces, native germplasm, and crop wild relatives (CWRs) possessing FAW resistance traits and about their potential resistance mechanisms, namely antibiosis, antixenosis, and tolerance. There is clear evidence of FAW resistance acting through diverse mechanisms in several maize landraces, germplasm lines, native populations, and CWRs such as Antigua race, FAW Tuxpeno, Zapalote Chico 2451F, Doce Flor da Serra, FAWCC (C5), CMS 14C, PopG (C2), MpSWCB-4, Mp708, Mp 704, CML 67, and FAW 7050, as well as a few species of teosinte and Tripsacum L. Further, a scheme that outlines strategies and approaches for prebreeding and their introgression into elite cultivars for developing FAW-resistant maize is proposed as a possible way forward.

Smith) populations in corn and irrigated rice leaves. Caterpillars from four populations from Rio Grande do Sul state were collected from isolated areas (distant more than 300 km apart), from the counties of Santa Rosa (M/SR) and Uruguaiana (A/U), traditional areas of corn and irrigated rice production, respectively, and in adjacent areas in Pelotas county, where corn (M/P) and rice (A/P) are grown side by side. In the laboratory, 150 caterpillars were individualized in glass vials containing leaves of the Pioneer 30F33 corn hybrid and the cultivar of the irrigated rice Pelota, under controlled temperature (25 +/- 1 degrees C), relative humidity (70 +/- 10%) and photophase (14h). After adult emergence, 20 couples were individualized in cylindrical PVC cages, covered inside with paper towels, and fed with a 10% honey aqueous solution. All populations of S. frugiperda collected from corn and rice, regardless their place of origin, showed unique physiological needs, as evidenced by the different biological parameters evaluated. The Populations M/SR and M/P (maize) and A/U and A/P (irrigated rice), did not differ physiologically. Based on the results, both "corn" and "rice" S.frugiperda biotypes are present in Rio Grande do Sul.

Plants used were a transgenic B. thuringiensis-expressing (Cry1Ab) corn hybrid and the corresponding isogenic untransformed B. thuringiensis-free hybrid. Two different prey species were used in the experiments, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Rhopalosiphum padi (Homoptera: Aphidae). Both species were not lethally affected by the Cry1Ab toxin. C. carnea larvae were placed individually in a searching arena together with two groups of prey to choose from. One group had eaten transgenic B. thuringiensis corn (Bt+), the other nontransgenic corn (Bt-). Choice-experiments with various prey and host plant combinations were performed. The number and type of prey consumed by C. carnea, the time C. carnea larvae spent feeding on their chosen prey and the number of prey C. carnea only "probed" upon for one minute or less were recorded. Observations were made for each of the three larval stages of C. carnea. When C. carnea could choose between S. littoralis fed transgenic corn (Bt+) and S. littoralis fed non-transgenic corn (Bt-), they showed a significant preference for S. littoralis fed non-transgenic corn (Bt-) as 3(rd) instars. Although not statistically significant, a similar trend was observed for the 2(nd) instar. No preference was observed when C. carnea had the choice between R. padi fed transgenic corn (Bt+) and R. padi fed non-transgenic corn (Bt-). This lack of preference for R. padi fed either transgenic or non-transgenic corn may be due to the absence of the Bt-protein in the phloem. In prey combinations with S. littoralis and R. padi, all three larval stages of C. carnea showed a preference for R. padi regardless whether they had fed on transgenic or non-transgenic corn. These findings arc discussed in context with biological control and pest resistance development.

H. Mull to Manduca sexta (L.) (Lepidoptera: Spingidae) and Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is conditioned by the high densities of 2-tridecanone-containing, glandular trichomes associated with the foliage. In laboratory experiments, rates of parasitism of M. sexta eggs by Telenomus sphingis (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) were lower among eggs on PI 134417 foliage than among eggs on foliage of the cultivated tomato L. esculentum Mill. (cv. Better Boy). The latter is characterized by a significantly lower density of type VI glandular trichomes than PI 134417 and an absence of 2-tridecanone. Parasitism by T. sphingis was also reduced among eggs on foliage of the F1 hybrid between PI 13447 and L. esculentum. The hybrid foliage lacks 2-tridecanone but has a density of type VI glandular trichomes that is intermediate between those of PI 134417 and L. esculentum, indicating that elevated densities of type VI glandular trichomes adversely affect T. sphingis. This conclusion was further substantiated by the finding that there were no differences among plant lines in the levels of parasitism of M. sexta eggs when the eggs were on foliage that had been divested of glandular trichomes. In bioassays in which T. sphingis adults or immatures in host eggs were exposed to filter paper treated with 2-tridecanone at rates comparable to those associated with PI 134417 foliage, 2-tridecanone was acutely toxic and caused high levels of mortality. In addition, at high concentrations, 2-tridecanone vapors were repellent to T. sphingis adults. However, when exposed to PI 134417 foliage, few T. sphingis adults were killed. Parasitism of M. sexta eggs was unaffected when the eggs were deposited by moths reared as fifth instar larvae on diet containing 2-tridecanone and/or 2-undecanone at levels comparable to those associated with PI 134417 foliage.

PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Wheat genotype; angoumois grain moth; chemical analysis of grains; resistance to moth; Sitotroga cerealella		Wheat is one of the most important cultivated crops in all almost all countries of the world. Hybrids have significantly increased the productivity and quality of this major crop. The aim of this study was to evaluate wheat genotype resistance to Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Oliv.) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Twelve wheat genotypes were tested against Sitotroga cerealella at 28 +/- 2 degrees C, relative humidity 65 +/- 5% and photoperiod L: D 12: 12 hours in the laboratory. The results, evaluated on the basis of percent weight loss, damage, grain size and chemical composition of the grains, revealed that none of the genotypes was completely resistant to the infestation by this pest. However, their response varied significantly. Genotype IBW -97103 (weight loss, 12.19%) had significant resistance followed by IBW-97083 (17.43%), Bakhtawar-92 (19.48%), F-Sarhad (19.66%), IBW-97406 (27.19%), IBW-97114 (27.32%), IBW-97259 (29.40%), IBW-97110 (29.70%), IBW-96405 (30.94%), IBW-97366 (31.02%), IBW-97112 (36.14%) and WS-94194 (40.93%). The coefficient of correlation between percent weight loss and other parameters was significant, except for grain size. The coefficient of correlation between weight loss and chemical constituents was also significant, except for ash content. From the study it was concluded that prolonged storage of the most susceptible genotypes to S. cerealella should be avoided and the most resistant varieties, namely BW-97103< IBW-97083< Bakhtawar-92, should be cultivated.

We surveyed the cut flower industry in South and Central America, focusing on Colombia and Ecuador, to determine their production and postharvest problems. We received a total of 51 responses, of which 62% of the respondents had 100 or more employees. The most commonly grown or handled crops were rose (Rosa hybrids), carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus), chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum xgrandiflorum), alstroemeria (Alstroemeria cultivars), gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii), and hydrangea (Hydrangea species), in order of ranking. The most significant production problem was insect management, with disease management and crop timing the next most important issues. The most important species-specific issues in production were phytosanitary problems, disease (causal organism not specified), leaf miner (Lepidoptera, Symphyta, or Diptera), and thrips (Thysanoptera). The main overall postharvest problem was temperature management, followed by hydration and flower food management and botrytis (Botrytis cinerea). In regard to on-farm postharvest handling, damage to the flowers was the most mentioned issue. For the postharvest during storage and transport phase, temperature management, air transport, damage, and botrytis were the most important problems. The most mentioned customer complaints were damage, botrytis, and phytosanitary problems. The results of this survey can be used by researchers to focus their work on topics of most need. Improved production and postharvest handling will support the continued growth of the cut flower industry.

J	Sperling, F; Byers, R; Hickey, D				Sperling, F; Byers, R; Hickey, D			Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation among pheromotypes of the dingy cutworm, Feltia jaculifera (Gn) (Lepidoptera:Noctuidae)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE			English	Article							NORTH-AMERICA; POPULATION; IDENTIFICATION; CHORISTONEURA; EVOLUTION; COMPLEX; MOTHS	The dingy cutworm, Feltia jaculifera, is a complex of at least four pheromonal races (pheromotypes). We examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence and restriction-site variation in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I and II genes. Among 74 specimens representing the four pheromotypes, we found three discrete mitochondrial lineages. The most divergent mtDNA within F. jaculifera, the gamma lineage, was associated with pheromotype C. This result confirms an earlier allozyme survey, which also found that pheromotype C was the most genetically distinct race. Thus, pheromotype C probably represents a classic sibling species. Of the two most similar mitochondrial lineages, the alpha lineage was disproportionately associated with pheromotype A and the beta lineage was disproportionately associated with pheromotypes B and D. Although the correspondence between mitochondrial lineages and pheromotypes was incomplete, mtDNA variation provides strong nonbehavioral evidence for genetic divergence between pheromotypes A and B + D. Allozymes revealed more minor differentiation among the A, B, and D races. For pheromotypes A and B, the presence of distinct mtDNA lineages within populations without perfect correspondence to pheromone polymorphism has several possible explanations. It may be due to retained ancestral mtDNA polymorphism, whether initial divergence of pheromone races occurred in allopatry or sympatry, or to divergence in isolation with introgression following secondary contact. The greater differences in allele frequencies of mtDNA than of allozymes may be due either to the susceptibility of mtDNA to bottleneck effects or to asymmetric selection against hybrid females.

An Indirect Defence Trait Mediated through Egg-Induced Maize Volatiles from Neighbouring Plants	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HERBIVORE-INDUCED VOLATILES; INDUCED RESISTANCE; CHILO-PARTELLUS; SPIDER-MITES; STEM BORERS; CIS-JASMONE; OVIPOSITION; RESPONSES; SIGNALS; APHID	Attack of plants by herbivorous arthropods may result in considerable changes to the plant's chemical phenotype with respect to emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). These HIPVs have been shown to act as repellents to the attacking insects as well as attractants for the insects antagonistic to these herbivores. Plants can also respond to HIPV signals from other plants that warn them of impending attack. Recent investigations have shown that certain maize varieties are able to emit volatiles following stemborer egg deposition. These volatiles attract the herbivore's parasitoids and directly deter further oviposition. However, it was not known whether these oviposition-induced maize (Zea mays, L.) volatiles can mediate chemical phenotypic changes in neighbouring unattacked maize plants. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the effect of oviposition-induced maize volatiles on intact neighbouring maize plants in 'Nyamula', a landrace known to respond to oviposition, and a standard commercial hybrid, HB515, that did not. Headspace volatile samples were collected from maize plants exposed to Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) egg deposition and unoviposited neighbouring plants as well as from control plants kept away from the volatile emitting ones. Behavioural bioassays were carried out in a four-arm olfactometer using egg (Trichogramma bournieri Pintureau & Babault (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)) and larval (Cotesia sesamiae Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)) parasitoids. Coupled Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for volatile analysis. For the ` Nyamula' landrace, GC-MS analysis revealed HIPV production not only in the oviposited plants but also in neighbouring plants not exposed to insect eggs. Higher amounts of EAG-active biogenic volatiles such as (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene were emitted from these plants compared to control plants. Subsequent behavioural assays with female T. bournieri and C. sesamiae parasitic wasps indicated that these parasitoids preferred volatiles from oviposited and neighbouring landrace plants compared to those from the control plants. This effect was absent in the standard commercial hybrid we tested. There was no HIPV induction and no difference in parasitoid attraction in neighbouring and control hybrid maize plants. These results show plant-plant signalling: 'Nyamula' maize plants emitting oviposition-induced volatiles attractive to the herbivore's natural enemies can induce this indirect defence trait in conspecific neighbouring undamaged maize plants. Maize plants growing in a field may thus benefit from this indirect defence through airborne signalling which may enhance the fitness of the volatile-emitting plant by increasing predation pressure on herbivores.

Complex inheritance of larval adaptation in Plutella xylostella to a novel host plant	HEREDITY			English	Article						host range expansion; diamondback moth; AFLP analysis; linkage mapping; inheritance	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; DIAMONDBACK MOTH; GENETIC-BASIS; OVIPOSITION PREFERENCE; ECOLOGICAL GENETICS; RANGE EVOLUTION; RESISTANCE; LEPIDOPTERA; INSECTS; LINKAGE	Studying the genetics of host shifts and range expansions in phytophagous insects contributes to our understanding of the evolution of host plant adaptation. We investigated the recent host range expansion to pea, in the pea-adapted strain (P-strain) of the crucifer-specialist diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). Larval survivorship on the novel host plant pea and a typical crucifer host (kale) was measured in reciprocal F-1, F-2 and backcrosses between the P-strain and a strain reared only on crucifers (C-strain). Reciprocal F-1 hybrids differed: offspring from P-strain mothers survived better on pea, indicating a maternal effect. However, no evidence for sex-linkage was found. Backcrosses to the P-strain produced higher survivorship on pea than C-strain backcrosses, suggesting recessive inheritance. In a linkage analysis with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers using P-strain backcrosses, two, four and five linkage groups contributing to survival on pea were identified in three different families respectively, indicating oligogenic inheritance. Thus, the newly evolved ability to survive on pea has a complex genetic basis, and the P-strain is still genetically heterogeneous and not yet fixed for all the alleles enabling it to survive on pea. Survivorship on kale was variable, but not related to survivorship on pea. This pattern may characterize the genetic inheritance of early host plant adaptation in oligophagous insect species.

Reciprocal parental crosses between Cry1Ab-susceptible and Cry1Ab-resistant populations, F-1 by F-1 crosses, and backcrosses of F-1 with the Cry1Ab-resistant population were successfully completed. Larval mortality of the parental and cross-populations were assayed on Cry I Ab diet and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-corn leaf tissue. Maternal effects and sex linkage were examined by comparing the larval mortality between the two F-1 populations. Dominance levels of resistance were measured by comparing the larval mortality of the Cry1Ab-resistant, -susceptible, and -heterozygous populations. Number of genes associated with the resistance was evaluated by fitting the observed mortality of F-2 and backcross populations with a Mendelian monogenic inheritance model. Cry1Ab resistance in D. saccharalis was likely inherited as a single or a few tightly linked autosomal genes. The resistance was incompletely recessive on Bt corn leaf tissue, while the effective dominance levels (D-ML) of resistance increased as Cry1Ab concentrations decreased with Cry1Ab-treated diet. D-ML estimated based on larval mortality on intact Bt corn plants reported in a previous study ranged from 0.08 to 0.26. This variability in D-ML levels of Cry1Ab resistance in D. saccharalis suggests that Bt corn hybrids must express a sufficient dose of Bt proteins to make the resistance genes functionally recessive. Thus, Bt resistant heterozygous individuals can be killed as desired in the "high/dose refuge" resistance management strategy for Bt corn. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Pest Status and Management of Corn Earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Field Corn in the United States	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Helicoverpa zea; transgenic crop; Bacillus thuringiensis; maize	HELICOVERPA-ZEA LEPIDOPTERA; FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; INSECTS ATTACKING CORN; PYRAMIDED BT TRAITS; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT; HELIOTHIS LEPIDOPTERA; BODDIE LEPIDOPTERA; STEINERNEMA RIOBRAVIS; VIRESCENS LEPIDOPTERA	The corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), is a common lepidopteran pest of corn (Zea mays L.) in the United States. This article provides an overview of the life history, ecology, plant injury, and management of H. zea in corn. Leaf injury by H. zea feeding can occur in vegetative stage corn, though this type of injury is rare. The most common type of injury is caused by larval feeding in ears. Because kernel injury is typically limited to the tip of the ear, H. zea is generally not considered an economic pest. The use of transgenic corn hybrids expressing insecticidal Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner can reduce injury from H. zea, though complete control is not achieved with most Bt traits. Resistance has been reported to several Bt toxins. Because H. zea is a major economic pest in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and because H. zea moths that developed on corn can migrate to cotton, selection pressure on H. zea in Bt corn has major implications for the pest status and injury to Bt cotton. Although the impact of H. zea on yield of field corn is generally negligible, the selection pressure exerted by Bt corn has led to management issues in cotton.	[Reay-Jones, Francis R.

The resulting neonates were bioassayed for susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1Ab protein. The median lethal concentrations (LC(50)s) for the different collections ranged from 0.42 to 2.37 ng/cm(2). The bioassay results suggest that Philippine corn borer populations were highly susceptible to Cry1Ab protein prior to the widespread deployment of Bt corn. The upper limit of the estimated LC99 (104 ng/cm(2)) from the pooled bioassay data was selected as a candidate diagnostic concentration and subsequently tested on eleven ACB populations. Results of the validation assays showed that the mortality response of all the tested ACB populations was higher than the expected mortality (99%). Therefore, the concentration of 104 ng/cm(2) was used to monitor susceptibility in ACB populations in the Philippines. Monitoring of field populations during 2009 in areas where Bt corn had been grown for 3 years found some enhanced survival of neonates at the diagnostic concentration but progeny of the diagnostic-concentration survivors did not survive on Bt corn, indicating that ACB populations in the Philippines remain susceptible to Cry1Ab-containing Bt corn hybrids.

Association of citrus leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) damage with physiological parameters and larval weight in Citrus reticulata	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						Phyllocnistis citrella; citrus; photosynthesis; stomatal conductance; infestation; larval weight	POPULATION FLUCTUATION; CAMERARIA-OHRIDELLA; LEAF; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PARASITOIDS; LEAVES; IMPACT	The citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton causes injury to citrus and related species in the Rutaceae family. The damage that the CLM larvae can cause is significant in citrus plantations. We tested two citrus cultivars-'Kinnow' (Citrus reticulata Blanco) and 'Fairchild' (a hybrid of Citrus reticulata Clementine x Orlando Tangelo) - to quantify CLM larvae infestation and effect on the physiology of the citrus cultivars. We then compared the CLM larval weight with its associated damage. To calculate infestation level, mine area and total leaf area, we used the image analysis technique. The infestation level of CLM was higher in 'Fairchild' than in 'Kinnow' cultivar of citrus. For both cultivars, larval weight of CLM was directly proportional to the amount of mines generated. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the mines that CLM larvae generate pose significant effect on the net photosynthetic rates and water use efficiency of citrus nursery plants. These results will help improve our understanding of the interaction between CLM and citrus nursery plants and effect of the pest on the yield potential of the crop.

We identified maize chromosome regions associated with antibiosis to the corn earworm, and compared the results with those previously obtained for concentration of silk maysin, a C-glycosyl flavone that inhibits larval growth. We evaluated antibiosis with a dried-silk bioassay of 76 (GT114 x GT119)F-2:3 lines, derived by self-pollinating Fz plants from the high and low tails of the distribution for silk maysin concentration. Variation in 8-d larval weights resulting from silks of the F-2:3 lines was compared with variation in restriction fragment length polymorphism genotypes at 39 flavonoid pathway loci or linked markers of corresponding F-2 plants. The multiple-locus model that best explained variation of larval weights included a major effect at the pi region of chromosome I and smaller effects in the umc166b region (chromosome 1) and the sh1 region (chromosome 9). The model for maysin concentration of the corresponding F-2 plants was nearly identical, with the exception that the sh1 locus was replaced by the nearby umc105a locus. Our results provide evidence that in this population silk maysin concentration and corn earworm antibiosis are under similar genetic control and that the pi locus plays the major role in determining variation in both traits. Because we evaluated the tails of the distribution and probed only at flavonoid pathway loci, all chromosome regions associated with corn earworm resistance in this population may not have been detected.

Insecticidal Activity of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Bh1 against Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Other Lepidopteran Pests	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; BRUSH-BORDER MEMBRANE; CROSS-RESISTANCE; BT MAIZE; PLUTELLA-XYLOSTELLA; CRYSTAL PROTEIN; MIDGUT; NOCTUIDAE; TOXINS	Bacillus thuringiensis is an important source of insect resistance traits in commercial crops. In an effort to prolong B. thuringiensis trait durability, insect resistance management programs often include combinations of insecticidal proteins that are not cross resistant or have demonstrable differences in their site of action as a means to mitigate the development of resistant insect populations. In this report, we describe the activity spectrum of a novel B. thuringiensis Cry protein, Cry1Bh1, against several lepidopteran pests, including laboratory-selected B. thuringiensis-resistant strains of Ostrinia nubilalis and Heliothis virescens and progeny of field-evolved B. thuringiensis-resistant strains of Plutella xylostella and Spodoptera frugiperda. Cry1Bh1 is active against susceptible and B. thuringiensis-resistant colonies of O. nubilalis, P. xylostella, and H. virescens in laboratory diet-based assays, implying a lack of cross-resistance in these insects. However, Cry1Bh1 is not active against susceptible or Cry1F-resistant S. frugiperda. Further, Cry1Bh1 does not compete with Cry1Fa or Cry1Ab for O. nubilalis midgut brush border membrane binding sites. Cry1Bh1-expressing corn, while not completely resistant to insect damage, provided significantly better leaf protection against Cry1Fa-resistant O. nubilalis than did Cry1Fa-expressing hybrid corn. The lack of cross-resistance with Cry1Ab and Cry1Fa along with independent membrane binding sites in O. nubilalis makes Cry1Bh1 a candidate to further optimize for in-plant resistance to this pest.

Aerial insecticide applications reproducing commercial production practices were made when D. saccharalis infestation levels exceeded a recommended action threshold. In addition to decreased D. saccharalis infestations, 6.3 - 14.5-fold reductions in end of season injury, expressed as the percentage of bored sugarcane internodes, were observed in plots treated with novaluron. D. saccharalis control in novaluron plots was equivalent to (P > 0.05) or better (P < 0.05) than that achieved with tebufenozide, an ecdysone agonist that has been extensively used for over a decade on sugarcane. With a numerical trend of a 3.1-fold decrease in percent bored internodes, the pyrethroid gamma-cyhalothrin seemed less effective than the biorational insecticides in protecting sugarcane against D. saccharalis. Using continuous pitfall trap sampling, no measurable (P > 0.05) decreases in predaceous and non-predaceous soil-dwelling non-target arthropods were associated with insecticides. However, numerical trends for decreases in immature crickets associated with novaluron and gamma-cyhalothrin were recorded in 2007. Our data suggest that novaluron will fit well in Louisiana sugarcane integrated pest management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Beuzelin, J. M.; Meszaros, A.; Reagan, T.

Within this group, dardanus and phorcas are shown to be sister-species, with constantinus as the stem. The supposed relationship of this group of three Rutaceae-feeding species to the five members of the Canellaceae/Lauraceae-feeding Papilio hesperus-group (including P.nobilis Rogenhofer) is questioned. The significance of this analysis is discussed with special reference to Trimen's original hypothesis on the evolution of mimetic patterns in female Papilio dardanus, the unique male patterns of phorcas and dardanus, and natural and laboratory-produced hybrids. A pathway modelling technique is developed to represent the possible course of evolution of the phorcas-group, in terms of speciation events and the accumulation and decay of the pattern polymorphisms.

Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (at 1500 infective juvenile/ ml concentraction), Steinerma glaseri (at 1500 infective juvenile/ ml concentration), H. bacteriophora + S. glaseri (at 1500 infective juvenile/ ml concentration), Xenorhabdus spp., (at 4 x 10(12) concentration) Photorhabdus spp., (at 4 x 10(12) concentration) metabolites of Xenorhabdus spp. (at 50% concentration) and metabolites of Photorhabdus spp (at 50% concentration) were sprayed on cabbage hybrid CB-60 grown in pots placed in the greenhouse. After 7 days, the highest P. brassicae larval mortality (90.43%) was observed where H. bacteriophora + S. glaseri were sprayed. In field experiment, best-performing treatments from greenhouse experiment were selected i.e. H. bacteriophora + S. glaseri (at 1500 infective juvenile/ ml concentration), Xenorhabdus spp., (at 4 x 10(12) concentration) and metabolites of Xenorhabdus spp. (at 50% concentration) were sprayed on a highly susceptible cabbage hybrid (CB-60). Heterorhabditis bacteriophora + Steinerma. glaseri @ 1500 infective juvenile/ ml was found to be more superior with maximum mortality (80.43) of cabbage butterfly larvae in comparison with other treatments. From the present study, it may be concluded that EPNs (H. bacteriophora and S. glaseri) application is more effective as compared to their symbiotic bacteria and metabolite for cabbage butterfly management.

E. Smith), is the main pest of maize in Brazil, attacking plants from emergence to reproductive stages. Here, we conducted studies to evaluate the efficacy of two seed treatments (chlorantraniliprole alone and imidacloprid combined with thiodicarb) on Bt and non-Bt maize in laboratory bioassays with distinct FAW strains that are susceptible, selected for resistance to Bt-maize single (Cry1F) or pyramided (Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2) events and F-1 hybrids of the selected and susceptible strains (heterozygotes), and in the field against a natural infestation. In the laboratory, leaf-discs from seed treated Bt-maize plants at 7 d after emergence (DAE) increased the mortality of FAW resistant, heterozygote, and susceptible strains up to 24.8%, when compared with the respective maize grown without a seed treatment. In the field against natural infestations of FAW, Bt maize with a seed treatment had similar to 30% less FAW damage than non-Bt maize with the same seed treatment at 7 and 14 DAE. No differences in FAW damage was observed between Bt and non-Bt maize grown with and without a seed treatment at 21 DAE. Maize seeds treated with chlorantraniliprole alone or imidacloprid and thiodicarb combined presented limited protection against early infestations of FAW strains under laboratory and field studies.

Life history parameters of H. armigera larvae feeding on young cotton plants showed a significant developmental delay of up to 7 d for the resistant strain compared with the susceptible strain on non-Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton. This fitness cost was not evident on artificial diet. There was no developmental delay in the F-1 hybrid progeny from the reciprocal backcross of the resistant and susceptible strains, indicating that the fitness cost is recessive. In two cohorts tested, survival to pupation of resistant larvae on Bt cotton expressing Cry1Ac was 54 and 51% lower than on non-Bt cotton, whereas all susceptible and F-1 larvae tested on Cry1Ac cotton were killed. Mortality of susceptible larvae occurred in the first or second instar, whereas the F-1 larvae were able to develop to later instars before dying, demonstrating that resistance is incompletely recessive. The intrinsic rate of increase was reduced by >50% in the resistant strain on Cry1Ac cotton compared with the susceptible strain on non-Bt cotton. There was a significant reduction in the survival of postdiapausal adults from the resistant strain and the F-1 strains, indicating that there is a nonrecessive overwintering cost associated with Cry1A resistance in H. armigera.

However, there has been considerable debate and concern about larval movement of the target insects in a seed blend because of its potential effect on the development of resistance. Reported here are studies to determine the larval movement of European corn borers, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), in a seed blend compared to a structured refuge and their effects on survival, feeding injury and larval fitness. Also evaluated is the relative performance of a purple seeded corn hybrid as a surrogate host plant for tracking gene flow. Seed blend and structured refuge arrangements of Agrisure GT/CB/LL Bt corn expressing Cry1Ab and isoline plants were evaluated at two locations in 2013 and 2014 by manually infesting refuge plants with first and second generation corn borer larvae. The majority of leaf and stalk injury was recorded on the refuge plant, which amounted to 66-83% of the total tunnel length. In both refuge arrangements, plant injury and the number of larvae recovered significantly decreased on neighboring plants with increasing distance away from the refuge plant in the same row. The relative decline in injury was much more pronounced in the seed blend, with neighbor Bt plants experiencing very minor tunneling or no injury at all due to the high dose trait. Eighty-nine percent fewer live larvae were also found on neighbor Bt plants in the seed blend compared to those found in the structured refuge plots. Larvae that moved to Bt plants as well as older instars that were manually placed on Bt plants failed to complete development. Comparison of the number of tunnels and larvae recovered per refuge plant indicated that the seed blend may not produce as many susceptible individuals as those produced in a structured refuge arrangement. Although the purple seeded hybrid showed lower levels of ear and stalk injury, it could serve as an appropriate surrogate refuge plant to track gene flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LEPIDOPTERA; AGE-STAGE; SPECIALIST; HERBIVORES; RESISTANCE	The fitness of Plutella xylostella L. on different genetically manipulated Brassica plants, including canola's progenitor (Brassica rapa L.), two cultivated canola cultivars (Opera and RGS(003)), one hybrid (Hyula(401)), one gamma-ray mutant-RGS(003), and one transgenic (PF) genotype was compared using two-sex and female-based life table parameters. All experiments were conducted in a growth chamber at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. There were significant differences in duration of different life stages of P. xylostella on different plant genotypes. The shortest (13.92 d) and longest (24.61 d) total developmental time were on Opera and PF, respectively. The intrinsic rate of increase of P. xylostella ranged between 0.236 (Opera) and 0.071 day(-1) (PF). The highest (60.79 offspring) and lowest (7.88 offspring) net reproductive rates were observed on Opera and PF, respectively. Comparison of intrinsic rate of increase, net reproductive rates, finite rate of increase, mean generation time, fecundity, and survivorship of P. xylostella on the plant genotypes suggested that this pest performed well on cultivars (RGS(003) and Opera) and performed poorly on the other manipulated genotypes especially on mutant-RGS(003) and PF. Glucosinolate levels were significantly higher in damaged plants than undamaged ones and the lowest and highest concentrations of glucosinolates were found in transgenic genotype and canola's progenitor, respectively. Interestingly, our results showed that performance and fitness of this pest was better on canola's progenitor and cultivated plants, which had high levels of glucosinolate.

Two of the most promising genetic methods for the control of epidopteran insects are inherited or F1 and hybrid sterility. To induce F1 sterility in C. partellus, male pupae were irradiated with various doses of gamma radiation (0-15 krad) and emerging adults of normal appearance were used in crosses with normal females. The F1 progeny were reared on artificial diet and the resulting adult males were crossed with unirradiated females to give F2, the process being repeated until F5 progeny were obtained. For each generation lifespan of males, oviposition, egg hatchability and sex ratio were carefully recorded. The results showed that females mated with irradiated males oviposited significantly fewer eggs than normal and that this phenomenon was perpetuated over several generations. Hatchability of eggs laid by females mated to irradiated males or male progeny was significantly lower than that of the controls and sex ratio was distorted slightly in favour of males in all generations observed. The lower oviposition, lower egg hatch, distortion of sex ratio in favour of males and the apparent persistence of sterility over several generations offer the potential of inherited sterility for the control of C. partellus.

Thus, several strains of C. sesamiae from Kenya are envisaged for introduction into western Africa. The present study investigates the reproductive compatibility between four populations of C. sesamiae from West Africa and Kenya with the noctuid Sesamia calamistis as the host using reciprocal crosses as well as backcrosses of hybrid females with males of the parental populations. Searching time of the male for the female and mating period varied significantly with couple and ranged between 0.78-1.9 min and 3.4-12.8 s, respectively. Crosses that involved females from inland Kenya (KI) did not yield any female offspring. However, backcrosses of hybrid female bearing a KI male genome with a KI male yielded both female and male offspring. Thus, there was a partial reproductive incompatibility between KI and West African populations which suggested that the latter were infected with Wolbachia sp. However, this should not affect the efficacy of a population introduced from East into West Africa, as there is a high degree of sib-mating in this gregarious parasitoid species. It was concluded that the regional differences in the relative importance of C. sesamiae was due to differences in the insect and plant host range of the different populations.

For this reason, the aim of this study was to determine the biotic and abiotic factors affecting populations through fortnightly sequential sampling, following a 2 x 2 moving displacement system, which sampled every two palms and every other line in a one hectare oil palm plantation, counting the number of live and dead individuals present in the 17th and 25th S. cecropia leaves of each palm evaluated. Results indicate that S. cecropia is attacked by a variety of predators, parasitoids and entomopathogens. Among the former are the spiders (Araneae), bugs (Reduviidae), wasps (Vespidae), and ants (Formicidae), with Crematogaster being the most important. Among the parasitoids, Brachymeria sp. and Rhysipolis sp. were most abundant. These species require the nectar of plants such as Melanthera aspera, Solanum quitoense, Emilia sonchifolia, Lantana camera, Cassia reticulata, Stachytarpheta cayennensis and Urena lobata, for food until the adult stage. An entomopathogenic fungus was also detected infecting the larval stage and was identified as Isaria sp. Crematogaster sp. predation on larval stages of S. cecropia was estimated to be 42 %. Parasitism by Brachymeria sp. in pupal stages was 16.8 %, mortality caused by Rhysipolis sp. on larval stages was 3.5 % and mortality by Isaria sp. was 1.5 %. It is concluded that these biological control agents are important in the regulation of S. cecropia populations in oil palm plantations in Colombia.

Toward the physiological basis for increased Agrotis ipsilon multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus infection following feeding of Agrotis ipsilon larvae on transgenic corn expressing Cry1Fa2	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Agrotis ipsilon; Lepidoptera; AgipMNPV; Baculoviridae; Herculex (R) I; Bacillus thuringiensis aizawai; Chymotrypsin; Gut physiology	NUCLEAR-POLYHEDROSIS-VIRUS; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS-RESISTANT; HELIOTHIS-VIRESCENS LEPIDOPTERA; BLACK CUTWORM LEPIDOPTERA; BORDER MEMBRANE-VESICLES; HELICOVERPA-ZEA; BACULOVIRUS INFECTION; PROTEINASE ACTIVITIES; OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS; ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY	Larvae of the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel, were more susceptible to infection by A. ipsilon multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgipMNPV: Baculoviridae) after feeding on Herculex (R) I, a transgenic corn hybrid expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-derived toxin Cry1Fa2 compared to larvae fed on isoline corn. We investigated the physiological basis for increased susceptibility to virus infection following exposure to Herculex (R) I by analyzing the midgut pH, gut protease activity and peritrophic matrix structure which are important factors for both Bt toxin action and baculovirus infection. No significant treatment differences were found in the pH of anterior midgut, central midgut or posterior midgut in larvae fed Herculex (R) I or isoline diets. Analysis of soluble and membrane-associated gut proteinase activities from larvae fed Herculex (R) I or isoline diets indicated that membrane-associated aminopeptidase activity and soluble chymotrypsin-like proteinase activity were significantly lower in Herculex (R) I -fed larvae compared to isoline-fed larvae. The number and relative molecular masses of soluble chymotrypsin-like proteinases did not differ. Baculoviruses were not susceptible to in vitro degradation by bovine chymotrypsin, suggesting that chymotrypsin degradation of baculovirus occlusion-derived virus did not result in reduced infection of larvae fed on isoline diet. Scanning electron micrographs of the peritrophic matrices of Herculex (R) I -fed larvae and isoline-fed larvae indicated that Herculex (R) I did not result in damage to the peritrophic matrix that could facilitate subsequent baculovirus infection. Additional research is required to further delineate the physiological basis for enhanced baculovirus infection following exposure to sublethal doses of Bt toxins. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Deuterium-labeled alcohols, aldehydes and fatty acids corresponding to the tao pheromone components were topically applied to the pheromone glands in different ratios and their selective incorporation into pheromone components was determined by gas chromatography with mass: selective detection, Acetylation of the (E)- and (Z)-11-tetradecenols was unselective, whereas the corresponding aldehydes and acids were selectively incorporated into the pheromone components, Z strain females selectively metabolized the Z-isomers whereas E strain females converted the E-isomers, The E strain being the most selective of the two strains, Hybrids converted both geometric isomers, The relative conversion rate of both E- and Z-isomers of all tetradecenoic acids with the double bond in positions from 7-12, was also determined, In addition to the Delta 11-isomers, the E strain females converted (E)-8-tetradecenoic acid into acetate and the Z strain females converted (E)-12-tetradecenoic acid. None of these substrates occur naturally in the pheromone gland, but (E)-12-tetradecenyl acetate is a pheromone component of the Asian corn borer O. furnacalis, Thus the possibility for conversion of (E)-12-tetradecenoic acid to acetate in the Z strain, as well as the earlier reported conversion of (Z)-11-tetradecenoic acid to acetate in O. furnacalis, suggests that O. furnacalis is closest related to the Z strain of O. nubilalis.

These records have generally exhibited similar but very distinctive wing color patterns on the upper and urdersides, especially the orange and blue on the hindwings. This paper reviews the 120-year history of "fletcheri"- type records and presents a number of new records, including some from P. glaucus and one from P. rutulus. Other female variants are also figured and compared since "fletcheri" Phenotypes have historically almost always been males. we report oil the first known female specimen of "fletcheri" from Vermont and discuss another female fletcheri phenotype captured in eastern Washington (also in 2008). It remains unclear whether interspecific introgression between P. canadensis, P. glaucus, and P. rutulus plays any role in generating these rare phenotypes, but fletcheri specimens are all from areas near the hybrid zone. Natural environmental conditions may play some role in causing this phenotype, especially since none have he en generated under lab conditions.	[Scriber, J.

NOCTUIDAE; AGE-STAGE; CULTIVARS; FECUNDITY; ARMYWORM; HISTORY	Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) is one of the polyphagous pests destroying crops such as sugar beet worldwide. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the resistance of 24 sugar beet genotypes to S. exigua. In this study, nine sugar beet cultivars (Dorotea, Tous, Persia, Silenta, Jaam, HM1339RZ, Jolgeh, Ekbatan, and SBSI006), three hybrids ((7112* SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5, (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-15, and (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-16), four lines (FC201, FC301, FC220, and FC221), and eight populations (SB26, SB27, SB28, SB29, SB30, SB33, SB34, and SB35) were assessed. The experiments were performed under laboratory conditions at 25 +/- 1(circle)C, 60 +/- 5% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h using age-stage, two-sex life table procedure. The larval period ranged from 17.09 d on FC301 to 14.47 d on SB30. The total fecundity (F) was highest on (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 (905.13 eggs) and lowest on FC301 (r.0.104 d(-1) ,lambda: 1.11 d(-1)) SB26 (r: 0.185 d(-1), lambda: 1.203 d(-1)) and FC220 (r: 0.114 d(-1), lambda: 1.12 d(-1)) had no significant difference with (7112* SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 and FC301, respectively. The comparison of demographic parameters of S. exigua on 24 sugar beet genotypes suggested that FC220 and FC301 were the most resistant and (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 and SB26 were the most susceptible genotypes to this pest.

Full utilization of transgenic poplars requires a comprehensive understanding of the growth-related phenotypic characteristics and ecological risks associated with of genetically modified trees. In the present study, we assessed the effects of transgenic poplar 741 with different insect-resistant genes on plant growth and arthropod communities in the field. Transgenic lines carrying the Cry1Ac and Cry3A genes were used as model lines, and non-transgenic poplar 741 was used as a control. Over a period of 6 years, we analyzed plant growth and transcriptomic data, and monitored arthropod richness and abundance in an experimental forest comparing transgenic and control lines. Our results indicate that the Pb29 line had a similar plant height to CK, but a significantly lower diameter at breast height (DBH) than CK. The plant height and DBH of the CC84 line were slightly higher than those of CK, but the differences were not significant. Transcriptome data analysis showed downregulated and upregulated expression of growth hormone-related genes and lignin synthesis-related genes, respectively, in the Pb29 line compared with CK and the CC84 line. The survey data obtained in this study showed that annual trends in arthropod numbers in the ecosystem were consistent among transgenic poplar 741 and control lines, gradually decreasing with time since planting. The Cry1Ac line has selective resistance to Lepidoptera and exerted strong toxic effects on Arctiidae, Tortricidae, and Notodontidae, but had no obvious effects on Lyonetiidae or Geometridae. The Cry3A line exhibited significant resistance to coleopterans only in 2016 when the abundance of coleopteran insects was high. Both lines exhibited inhibitory effects on non-target pests. The two transgenic lines were similar to the control with respect to arthropod community structure, and there were no significant differences in arthropod diversity indices between transgenic and control lines, although richness was slightly higher for the Cry3A line than for the control. The results of this study showed that the insertion of Bt genes had no apparent inhibitory effect on the growth of poplar 741. Also, there was no adverse environmental impact of transgenic poplar 741 on ecosystem arthropod communities compared with conventional poplar 741.

A third toxin, Vip3A, is available in pyramids expressing two or more Bt toxins in corn hybrids and cotton varieties, but uncertainty exists regarding deployment strategies. During a growing season, H. zea infests corn and cotton, and debate arises over use of Vip3A toxin in corn where H. zea is not an economic pest. We used a three-locus, spatially explicit simulation model to evaluate when using Vip3A in corn might hasten evolution of resistance to Vip3A, with implications in cotton where H. zea is a key pest. When using a conventional refuge in corn and initial resistance allele frequencies of Cry1A and Cry2A were 10%, transforming corn with Vip3A slowed resistance to these toxins and delayed resistance evolution to the three-toxin pyramid as a whole. When Cry resistance allele frequencies exceeded 30%, transforming corn with Vip3A hastened the evolution of resistance to the three-toxin pyramid in cotton. When using a seed blend refuge strategy, resistance was delayed longest when Vip3A was not incorporated into corn and used only in cotton. Simulations of conventional refuges were generally more durable than seed blends, even when 75% of the required refuge was not planted. Extended durability of conventional refuges compared to other models of resistance evolution are discussed as well as causes for unusual survivorship in seed blends.

However, phylogeographic data of the species are lacking. Results: We analysed 284 individuals from 38 populations across Europe, Asia, and North America. A 1242 bp fragment of the mitochondria, COI gene and an 893 bp fragment of the 285 rDNA has been Sanger sequenced. Twenty-four haplotypes were detected on the COI gene, and two alleles were identified on the 28S rDNA We revealed two distinct clades for both markers reflecting the geographic origins, Asia and Europe. The genetic distance between the two main clades is 2.08% on the COI gene and 0.10% on the nuclear DNA. An overlapping zone of the two clades was found across Eastern Europe and the Anatolian Peninsula. We detected heterozygote individuals of the 285 rDNA gene in Moldavia, Ukraine and in the southern part of Turkey. These suggest that the two clades can hybridise. Furthermore, the presence of European type homozygote individuals has been confirmed in the southern part of Turkey as well. Conclusions: We have shown that both post-glacial recolonization and recent expansion events influenced the present genetic structure of P. platani. The genetic patterns revealed at least two refugia during the last ice age: one in the Balkan Peninsula and the other in the Caucasus region. Recent expansion was detected in some European and Central Asian populations. The two main clades (Europe/Asia) show definite genetic differences; however, several hybrid individuals were found in the overlapping zone as well (stretching over Eastern Europe and the Anatolian Peninsula). Discrepancies in mitochondrial and nuclear data indicate introgressions in the southern part of the Anatolian Peninsula.

Effects of Pink Bollworm Resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis on Phenoloxidase Activity and Susceptibility to Entomopathogenic Nematodes	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						biological control; fitness cost; immune response; integrated resistance management; simulation modeling	HELICOVERPA-ARMIGERA LEPIDOPTERA; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENTS; MOTH EPHESTIA-KUEHNIELLA; FITNESS COSTS; INSECT RESISTANCE; HOST-PLANT; BT COTTON; TRANSGENIC COTTON; TRICHOPLUSIA-NI; STEINERNEMA-CARPOCAPSAE	Widespread planting of crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) imposes selection on many key agricultural pests to evolve resistance to Bt. Fitness costs can slow the evolution of Bt resistance. We examined effects of entomopathogenic nematodes on fitness costs of Bt resistance in the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a major pest of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., in the southwestern United States that is currently controlled by transgenic cotton that produces Bt toxin Cry1Ac. We tested whether the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema riobrave Cabanillas, Poinar, and Raulston (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) affected fitness costs of resistance to Cry1Ac in two laboratory-selected hybrid strains of pink bollworm reared on non-Bt cotton bolls. The nematode S. riobrave imposed a recessive fitness cost for one strain, and H. bacteriophora imposed a fitness cost affecting heterozygous resistant individuals for the other strain. Activity of phenoloxidase, an important component of insects' immune response, did not differ between Bt-resistant and Bt-susceptible families. This suggests phenoloxidase does not affect susceptibility to entomopathogenic nematodes in Bt-resistant pink bollworm. Additionally, phenoloxidase activity does not contribute to Bt resistance, as has been found in some species. We conclude that other mechanisms cause higher nematode-imposed mortality for pink bollworm with Bt resistance genes. Incorporation of nematode-imposed fitness costs into a spatially explicit simulation model suggests that entomopathogenic nematodes in non-Bt refuges could delay resistance by pink bollworm to Bt cotton.

(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was monitored in fields with up to 117 accessions of Nicotiana species (Solanaceae) during 1985-1994 at Oxford, NC, Tifton, GA, and Athens, GA. Large numbers of wasps were observed flying over or resting on several Nicotlana species, especially N. noctiflora Hooker and N. sanderae Hort. ex Watson (hybrid between N. alata Link & Otto and hi. forgetiana Hort, ex Hemsley). During the IO-vr sampling period, an average of 60 times as many C. nigriceps adults mere counted in N. noctiflora plots and 19 times as many wasps were counted in N. sanderae plots than were found in commercial tobacco, N. tabacum L. ('NC 2326'), even though N. noctiflora and N. sanderae are poor host plants for tobacco budworm larvae. Male wasps predominated in plots of N. noctiflora; whereas, female wasps predominated in cultivated tobacco fields. There were no significant differences in the sex ratios of wasps collected from N. alata or N. sanderae. C. nigriceps adults were associated primarily with the flowers of, N. sanderae, N. alata, and N. forgetiana, but they were found equally on the leaves and flowers of N. noctiflora. C. nigriceps adults appeared to be attracted to volatile components from N. noctiflora leaves and flowers. Several kilograms of field-grown N. noctiflora flowers and leaves were extracted with methylene chloride, and the volatile components were isolated. Gas chromatography showed only 4 volatile peaks of interest in N. noctiflora, and they were identified as nitrogen-sulfur heterocycles.

Seven commercial tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill, cultivars 'Marmand','Edkawy', VF-145, GS-27,'Pakmor-B', 'Floradade', and UCX-281 grown under greenhouse conditions were evaluated for differences in mortality and feeding (leaf area ingested) of fourth-instar larvae of cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduvar), and Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). Plants of the cultivars Floradade, GS-27, and Packmor-B sustained the most damage (more leaf area ingested) by cottom leafworm, while GS-27 and VF-145 sustained the most damage by Colorado potato beetle. Mortality of Colorado potato beetle was lowest on the F1 hybrid GS-27, indicating that GS-27 was the most susceptible cultivar to Colorado potato beetle. Variation in chemical and nutrient composition (reducing sugars, total sugars, ascorbic acid, total phenols and total protein content) of leaves explained some of the observed differences in mortality and feeding among the tomato cultivars and insect species. The correlation coefficient of reducing sugars with leaf consumption was positive (0.758) for S. littoralis and negative (-0.485) for L. decemlineata. The correlation coefficients of ascorbic acid with insect mortality were negative (-0.389 for S. littoralis and -0.459 for L. decemlineata) indicating that they may require ascorbic acid for growth. Total phenols in tomato leaflets were positively correlated with mortality of S. littoralls. Edkawy, VF-145. and UCX-281 were the most resistant cultivars.

Relationship between oviposition, virulence gene expression and parasitism success in Cotesia typhae nov sp parasitoid strains	GENETICA			English	Article						Parasitoid; Reproductive success; Oviposition behaviour; Polydnavirus; New host; Biological control	CEREAL STEM BORERS; LEPIDOPTERAN STEMBORERS; HYMENOPTERA-BRACONIDAE; CHELONUS-INANITUS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; FLAVIPES COMPLEX; LIFE-HISTORY; POLYDNAVIRUS; EVOLUTION; HOST	Studying mechanisms that drive host adaptation in parasitoids is crucial for the efficient use of parasitoids in biocontrol programs. Cotesia typhae nov. sp. (Fernandez-Triana) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a newly described parasitoid of the Mediterranean corn borer Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Braconidae are known for their domesticated bracovirus, which is injected with eggs in the host larva to overcome its resistance. In this context, we compared reproductive success traits of four Kenyan strains of C. typhae on a French and a Kenyan populations of its host. Differences were found between the four strains and the two most contrasted ones were studied more thoroughly on the French host population. Parasitoid offspring size was correlated with parasitism success and the expression of bracovirus virulence genes (CrV1 and Cystatin) in the host larva after parasitism. Hybrids between these two parasitoid strains showed phenotype and gene expression profiles similar to the most successful parental strain, suggesting the involvement of dominant alleles in the reproductive traits. Ovary dissections revealed that the most successful strain injected more eggs in a single host larva than the less successful one, despite an equal initial ovocyte number in ovaries. It can be expected that the amount of viral particles increase with the number of eggs injected. The ability to bypass the resistance of the allopatric host may in consequence be related to the oviposition behaviour (eggs allocation). The influence of the number of injected eggs on parasitism success and on virulence gene expression was evaluated by oviposition interruption experiments.

This species has diverged into two genetically differentiated but morphologically identical strains, "the rice" and "the corn". They have been analyzed by sequencing the genes cytochrome oxydase I, II and ITS1 from populations from the United States and Brazil. However, no such studies were performed in Colombia. In here, we identified 43 haplotypes by sequencing a fragment of the COI gene from 102 individuals, of which 40 had already been identified as the "corn" and "rice" strains or to their hybrids from Tolima, and the rest were collected from corn, cotton, sorghum, grass and rice fields in other regions of Colombia. The corn strain haplotype H1 was the most frequently found in this country, representing the main target for FAW monitoring programs. AMOVA analysis confirmed the population structure between Colombian and North American S. frugiperda haplotypes (F-ST = 0.76812, P < 0.001), but not within the different Colombian regions, suggesting high gene flow within the country. The ML trees obtained for Tolima and for Colombia as a whole did not generate clustering amongst S. frugiperda sequences, neither via host-plant association nor by geographical areas. The minimum spanning network for Colombia corroborated our finding that the haplotype H1 has the highest frequency in the country. Our data suggest that haplotype frequency determination will be useful in the establishment of a monitoring system for this species.	[Saldamando-Benjumea, C.

Alternate crop and weed host plant oviposition preferences by the Mexican rice borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Corn; Eoreuma loftini; Infestation; Sorghum; Sugarcane; Weeds	EOREUMA-LOFTINI LEPIDOPTERA; DIATRAEA-SACCHARALIS; TEXAS SUGARCANE; PYRALIDAE; CORN; INSECTICIDES; RESISTANCE; LINEOLATA; SELECTION; SITES	The Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), is the key pest of sugarcane, Saccharum hybrids, in south Texas, having largely displaced the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), and it is moving into rice- and sugarcane-growing areas of east Texas and Louisiana. While a number of alternative weed and crop hosts have been reported, the extent to which they might support Mexican rice borer populations is unknown. This study involved choice assays that compared oviposition preference for and larval infestations of five mature graminaceous weed species. Levels of infestation between sugarcane and corn, Zea mays L, crop hosts and between corn and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, were also assessed. We determined that the average number of larval entry holes in sudangrass stems was >= 2.5-fold more than for any of the other four weed host plants, that corn had >= 5.9-fold more larval entry holes than sorghum and >= 8.2-fold more than sugarcane. Greater oviposition and infestation of one non-crop host over another was not related to numbers of stems per plant, but was associated with the greater stem diameter and abundance of dry leaf tissue found in Sudangrass, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench ssp. drummondi (Nees ex Steud.) de Wet & Harlan, johnsongrass, S. halepense (L.) and barnyardgrass, Echinochloa crus-galli (L) P. Beauv.; relative to the other weed species in this study. In terms of the crop plants, stalk diameter and quantity of dry leaf tissue were not associated with numbers of eggs or larval entry holes in the choice assays between corn and sorghum, and between sugarcane and corn. While corn has been known as a host of the Mexican rice borer for at least 84 yr, its role in area-wide population dynamics and control efforts has likely been greatly underestimated.

E. Smith, 1797). has become one of the most devastating pests in the world with diverse host range. To develop effective integrated management strategies against S. frugiperda it is crucial to know its alternative host plants. In this study, we provide the first information on the occurrence of S. frugiperda in onion crops in Africa. Monitoring was carried out during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons in onion monoculture and in intercropping with groundnut to detect the presence and assess the incidence of S. frugiperda. The highest average incidence (2.88%) and larval density (0.79 per 9 m(2)) were observed in onion monoculture. The classification of the onion leaf damage rating scale indicated low S. frugiperda infestation. This suggests that future studies will need to assess this aspect which we consider to be a survival strategy to maintain its population throughout the year. which contributes to sustain the insect in the study area during times when its preferred hosts are not present. Furthermore, genetic studies are needed to provide a better explanation of the ecology of this pest and to find out which of the two existing strain infests onions or whether it is an unknown hybrid population of S. frugiperda.

J	Reineke, A; Zebitz, CPW				Reineke, A; Zebitz, CPW			Suitability of polymerase chain reaction-based approaches for identification of different gypsy moth (Lepidoptera : Lymantriidae) genotypes in central Europe	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						Lymantria dispar; polymerase chain reaction; molecular markers; nucleic acids	DISPAR L; ARBITRARY PRIMERS; UNITED-STATES; DNA; POPULATIONS; MARKERS; PCR	Two different molecular marker approaches-random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and restriction site polymorphism analysis of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS-2) - have been used to assess whether Asian genotypes of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., have been introduced or migrated to central Europe. In previous studies, both marker systems have proved to be reliable for distinguishing Asian and North American genotypes of this insect and thus for detecting the geographical origin of pheromone-trapped specimens in North America. RAPD analysis of >1,000 samples from 18 different geographical origins in Europe revealed that-with the exception of 2 locations-Asian, North American, and hybrid RAPD markers were present at varying proportions in all European populations. However, none of the European gypsy moth specimens was classified as Asian genotype after analysis of the ITS-8 region. The results are discussed in relation to the possible bottlenecks associated with the release of a small number of European moths in North America and the different genomic regions analyzed with both marker systems. These effects may have influenced the suitability of both diagnostics for distinguishing gypsy moth isolates from different geographical origins.

Estimating the frequency of Cry1F resistance in field populations of the European corn borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						pair mating; Bt resistance; allele frequencies; F1 and F2 screening; European corn borer	HELICOVERPA-ARMIGERA LEPIDOPTERA; OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS LEPIDOPTERA; ALLELES CONFERRING RESISTANCE; THURINGIENSIS TOXIN CRY1AB; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; INSECT RESISTANCE; BT CROPS; CROSS-RESISTANCE; TRANSGENIC CROPS; FITNESS COSTS	BACKGROUND Transgenic corn hybrids that express toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have suppressed European corn borer populations and reduced the pest status of this insect throughout much of the US corn belt. A major assumption of the high-dose/refuge strategy proposed for insect resistance management and Bt corn is that the frequency of resistance alleles is low so that resistant pests surviving exposure to Bt corn will be rare. RESULTS The frequency of resistance to the Cry1F Bt toxin was estimated using two different screening tools and compared with annual susceptibility monitoring based on diagnostic bioassays and LC50 and EC50 determinations. An F-1 screening approach where field-collected individuals were mated to a resistant laboratory strain and progeny were assayed to determine genotype revealed that resistance alleles could be recovered even during the first year of commercially available Cry1F corn (2003). Estimates of frequency from 2003-2005 and 2006-2008 indicated that, although allele frequency was higher than theoretical assumptions (0.0286 and 0.0253 respectively), there was no indication that the frequency was increasing. Similar estimates in 2008 and 2009 using an F-2 screening approach confirmed the presence of non-rare resistance alleles (frequency approximate to 0.0093 and 0.0142 for 2008 and 2009, respectively). The results of both screening methods were in general agreement with the observed mortality in diagnostic bioassays and LC50 and EC50 determinations. CONCLUSIONS These results are consistent with previous modeling results, suggesting that the high-dose/refuge strategy that is in place for Bt corn may be effective in delaying resistance evolution even when a relatively high frequency of resistance alleles exists.

Host strain specific sex pheromone variation in Spodoptera frugiperda	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY			English	Article							FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; BIOSYNTHESIS-ACTIVATING NEUROPEPTIDE; FRAGMENT-LENGTH-POLYMORPHISMS; HELICOVERPA-ZEA; NOCTUIDAE POPULATIONS; HELIOTHIS-VIRESCENS; INSECT PHEROMONES; DESATURASE GENES; FIELD-EVALUATION; IDENTIFICATION	Background: The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae) consists of two distinct strains with different host plant preferences for corn and rice. To assess whether pheromonal-mediated behavioral isolation accompanies the habitat isolation on different host plants, we compared the sex pheromone composition among females of the two strains. Pheromone glands were extracted with or without injection of pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN). To assess the mode of inheritance of this variation, we also analyzed the pheromone composition of F-1 hybrid females. Results: Relative to intra- strain variation, the pheromone composition of the two strains differed significantly. Corn strain females contained significantly more of the second most abundant pheromone compound Z11-16:Ac (m), and significantly less of most other compounds, than rice strain females. When females were injected with PBAN before their glands were extracted, the differences between the strains were less pronounced but still statistically significant. The pheromone composition of hybrid females showed a maternal inheritance of the major component Z9-14:Ac (M) as well as of Z11-16:Ac (m). Most other compounds showed an inheritance indicating genetic dominance of the corn strain. The within-strain phenotypic correlations among the various components were consistent with their hypothesized biosynthetic pathway, and between-strain differences in the correlation structure suggested candidate genes that may explain the pheromone differences between the two strains. These include Delta 9- and Delta 11 desaturases, and possibly also a Delta 7-desaturase, although the latter has not been identified in insects so far. Conclusion: The two host strains of S. frugiperda produce systematically differing female sex pheromone blends. Previously- documented geographic variation in the sexual communication of this species did not take strain identity into account, and thus may be partly explained by different strain occurrence in different regions. The finding of pheromone differences reinforces the possibility of incipient reproductive isolation among these strains, previously shown to differ in the timing of nocturnal mating activity and host plant use. Finding the genetic basis of the pheromone differences, as well as these other biological traits, will help to elucidate the role of premating isolation in the continuing differentiation of these two strains that may eventually lead to speciation.

The effects of introducing malathion susceptible males into the population were monitored by determining the LD50s for 21 day old larvae from each population. F1 hybrid larvae were found to be intermediate in resistance between larvae from the parental strains, and resistance appeared to be inherited in a codominant fashion. Populations which received only a single release of males were, in general, more malathion susceptible the greater the introduction ratio (except at a ratio of 20:1). Larger populations subjected to repeated introductions of susceptible males showed a clear trend of decreasing larval survival after malathion treatment with increasing release ratio (including the 20:1 ratio). These results indicated that desirable alleles, such as those for insecticide susceptibility, can be introduced into established populations, and that this line of research should be given more emphasis in preventing development of resistance or in ameliorating established resistance.

Putumayo, Colombia, based on molecular and morphological characters. The new species, H. tristero, is a close relative of H. cydno, a geographically differentiated species which lacks red coloration and engages in Mullerian mimicry with other blue and yellow Heliconius species in Central and northwestern South America. H. tristero has switched mimetic associations, instead mimicking the local, sympatric forms of two widespread mimetic species, H. erato and H. melpomene. This discovery provides evidence that the splinter species H. heurippa, H. tristero and H. timareta represent phenotypically divergent members of the H. cydno group that are endemic to successive river valleys on the eastern slope of the northern Andean Cordillera. The nominal taxon Heliconius amaryllis bellula Stichel, currently misapplied to both H. tristero and H. melpomene populations from the Mocoa region of Colombia, is considered here to represent a hybrid between H. heurippa and H. tristero. The Mocoa melpomene race is formally named Heliconius melpomene mocaa, new subspecies. (C) 1996 The Linnean Society of London.

Phase I, random local processes (including genetic drift and idiosyncratic selection), and phase III, interdemic selection are the most controversial phases of the shifting balance. Phase II consists of ordinary natural selection to a new adaptive peak within populations, and is uncontroversial. 3. Heliconius have bold patterns of iridescent blue, black, yellow, white, and red. These are clearly warning patterns, and near-perfect Mullerian mimicry has evolved among species, suggesting tight control by natural selection. Field experiments have also demonstrated strong selection (often s > 0.1 on single colour pattern loci), and the population structure of Heliconius is typically not conducive to phase I. Yet the colour patterns are clearly somewhat independent and incompatible signals of unpalatability. 4. There is empirical evidence in Heliconius for both controversial phases. For phase I, occasional and local polymorphisms of colour pattern in a number of species go against the generally expected (and generally observed) monomorphism for Mullerian mimics. 5. For phase III, one of the few colour pattern clines mapped in detail has been observed to move rapidly over a period of 20 years. There are also a number of curious 'leapfrog' geographical disjunctions in colour pattern races. Disjunctions are expected if successful races have spread from the centre of the range (e.g. the Amazonian rayed races) via phase III, in competition with earlier races that are now distributed in scattered places along the periphery of the range. 6. Evidence from the genomes of Heliconius may in the near future aid in understanding colour pattern 'supergenes' and to help test for origin and spread via shifting balance.

Sampling European corn borer (Lepidoptera : Crambidae) larvae from seed corn drying bins for Bt resistance monitoring	SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS TOXINS; METARHIZIUM-ANISOPLIAE; BEAUVERIA-BASSIANA; HELIOTHIS-VIRESCENS; ENTOMOGENOUS FUNGI; INSECT RESISTANCE; F-2 SCREEN; FIELD; TEMPERATURE; STATISTICS	Monitoring for resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) toxins in transgenic crops is challenging, in part because alleles conferring resistance appear to be rare. Consequently, several complementary methods are used to identify, collect and test putatively resistant individuals. A series of experiments conducted at commercial seed production facilities explored an alternative sampling method. Larvae of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, were collected from bins containing Bt hybrid seed corn and their inbred progeny (both F-2 and backcross-F-2 larvae) were tested for resistance to the Bt toxin Cry1Ab. Marked, laboratory-reared O. nubilalis larvae also were placed beneath drying corn ears to evaluate potential contamination of samples by larvae developing on non-Bt corn. Both feral and laboratory-reared larvae were used to examine the causes and levels of mortality of larvae in drying bins. Screening of larvae on diet containing Cry1Ab failed to provide evidence of resistance, although insufficient inbred lines survived to make conclusions about the presence of resistance alleles in larvae originally collected beneath Bt corn. Both larvae from previously dried non-Bt corn and O. nubilalis moving between adjacent bins are potential sources of contamination of larvae collected beneath drying Bt corn. Exposure to conditions inside seed corn drying bins for 3 d significantly increased O. nubilalis mortality. Larvae collected beneath seed corn also showed infection by the pathogens Nosema pyrausta (Paillot) and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, with significant mortality apparently caused by B. bassiana. While contamination and mortality may limit the application of sampling beneath drying bins, several modifications could improve the potential utility of the technique.

Screening of South African sugarcane cultivars for resistance to the stalk borer, Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae)	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Eldana saccharina; cultivar; pest management; resistance mechanisms; screening methodology; stalk borer; sugarcane; susceptibility rating	LOUISIANA; CRAMBIDAE	Resistant sugarcane cultivars are an important control measure for the stalk borer, Eldana saccharina Walker, in South African sugarcane, Saccharum spp. hybrids. Selection for resistance is based on field assessments and potted sugarcane screening trials of test cultivars. This paper describes the screening methodology and examines its efficacy for evaluating susceptibility to E. saccharina. Aims were to improve discrimination of borer susceptibility and to develop a quantitative, statistically meaningful method of rating cultivars. Test cultivars were planted in a replicated lattice design and artificially infested with E. saccharina. Four variables, namely length of stalk bored, number of internodes bored, numbers of surviving larvae + pupae, mass of larvae + pupae, that quantified borer damage and performance, were used to calculate a susceptibility/resistance rating for all cultivars on a 'one to nine' unit scale, where two units was equivalent to a 95 % confidence interval and the mid-point of the scale represented the control mean. Ratings were standardized and independent of those of other test cultivars within the same trial. Differences in susceptibility were significant in all trials and well discriminated in the majority. Improved discrimination produced a greater spread of cultivar ratings across the rating scale, facilitating the identification of resistant cultivars. The screening method and variables measured take into account the known resistant mechanisms to E. saccharina and provide a means of estimating the likely impact of cultivars on area-wide pest management in terms of larval survival and moth production.

The treatments included methomyl applied to grassy adult aggregation areas, or "action sites," for adult suppression, fenvalerate applied to the field for larval control, a combination of methomyl applied to the action site with fenvalerate applied to the field, and an untreated check. Two applications were made in and around fields of hybrid seed production during the second flight (mid-July to late-August) in Iowa. The male, or tasselled inbred, sustained higher levels of larval infestation, resulting in a greater response to treatment. Larval tunnelling damage and infestation level were reduced with applications of fenvalerate to the field. Although applications of methomyl resulted in fewer adults in the grass following action site treatment, the subsequent effect on infestation and damage was not significant. Adult sampling data during high population levels in 1986 documented a temporary reduction of adults in the action site after treatment, suggesting a lack of residual activity by methomyl. Blacklight trap data indicated that the timing of initial insecticide applications in the action site corresponded with a majority of newly mated and actively ovipositing females and second applications targeted ovipositing and post-oviposition females.

This pest has been controlled almost exclusively with chemical insecticides and Bt plants (transgenics); however,resistance evolution has been detected to these two control tactics. Therefore, alternative control tactics are needed for management and control of the fall armyworm. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the resistance of maize landraces from Brazil to larvae of this herbivore in the winter and summer seasons, studying also the occurrence of the predator Doru luteipes (Dermaptera: For ficulidae). The variety Perola had the highest resistance levels to fall armyworm in the summer season, with lower values of leaf injury, number of infested plants, and number of larvae. Conversely, this variety did not express resistance to the pest in winter. Doru luteipes was found abundantly in the summer season, showing no differences between varieties. This is the first study to evaluate the resistance of maize landraces from Brazil to fall armyworm in the winter and summer seasons. The next step is the molecular characterization of the variety Perola, as well as evaluating its effects on the most common natural enemies of the pest in Brazil, such as the predator D. luteipes and the egg parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). These results may assist future maize breeding programs aimed at developing cultivars and hybrids resistant to the pest, and hence reducing agriculture'sdependence on chemical insecticides and transgenic plants.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ten different sugar beet genotypes on nutritional indices of the beet army worm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lep.: Noctuidae) at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (L: D) hour. The sugar beets evaluated in this study included two sugar beet cultivars (HM 1339 RZ and SBSI006), five populations (SB26, SB27, SB29, SB33, SB34), one hybrid (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 and two lines (FC 301 and FC 220). Fourth instar larvae reared on (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 showed the highest Relative Growth Rate (RGR) of 0.31 mg mg(-1) day(-1), Relative Consumption Rate (RCR) of 4.79 mg mg(-1) day(-1) and Approximate Digestibility (AD) value of 94.35% compared with the other host plants. The lowest value of RCR (0.81 mg mg(-1) day(-1)) was on SBSI006. The Efficiency of Conversion of Ingested food (ECI) was varied from 1.80% on FC 220 to 9.14% on SB34. The highest AD value of fifth instar (92.63%) was on (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 and the lowest value of this index was recorded on SB27 (83.71%). The highest AD value of whole larval instars was noted in (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 (93.73%). The lowest value of RCR (1.78 mg mg(-1) day(-1)) was found on SB27. The heaviest pre-pupa (81.01 mg), pupa (72.55 mg) and wet adults (19.14 mg) of beet armyworm were recorded on (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5. The results indicated that (7112*SB36)* Sh-1-HSF-5 was the most suitable host for S. exigua that should be considered in cultivation or breeding programs.	[Talaee, L.; Fathipour, Y.; Talebi, A.

These species have a great importance to in natura fruits consumption, industrialization, medicinal use and also as ornamental plants. The different Passiflora species are host of a great diversity of arthropods that can cause injuries, economic damages and, in some situations, the plant death. Among the arthropods, leafhopper caterpillars are considered frequent and severe pests in the main passion fruit producing regions. The present work is an occurrence report of Isia alcumena and Spodoptera cosmioides attacking passion fruit plants (Passiflora edulis Sims) in the Federal District, Brazil. The S. cosmioides and S. eridania caterpillars were collected while consuming leaves of Passiflora edulis intra-specific hybrid located in the Germplasm Active Bank 'Flor da PaixAo' at Embrapa Cerrados. The caterpillars of I. alcumena were collected on leaves of the Passiflora edulis cv. BRS Rubi do Cerrado at the Agricultural Support Unit, Embrapa Cerrados. After collected, the caterpillars were individualized in a breeding system with leaves of the host plants. The development of the caterpillar was accompanied until the emergence of the adults, which were identified and fixed in entomological pins for permanent dry preservation.

Montenegrina and Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck x Citrus reticulata Blanco hybrid Murcott), in Montenegro County (29 degrees 68'S and 51 degrees 46'W), southern Brazi l. At fortnightly samplings, from July 2001 to June 2003, all the new shoots from 24 randomly selected trees were inspected. The species richness reached five native species in the Murcott orchard, and six in Montenegrina. In Murcott, the presence of Ageniaspis citricola (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), an exotic species, was detected in the first year of sampling, probably migrating from the nearby areas where it had been released for the miner control. In Montenegrina, its presence was only registered in the second year. A. citricola in both areas was dominant and changed the community structure of parasitoid complex of P citrella in both orchards.

Johnstown is in an area known to maintain a univoltine population of O. nubilalis. The 30,000 inbred corn plants tested for resistance, however, were infested each year with a bivoltine population of O. nubilalis. Each sample site collection was maintained as a separate population, and the 2nd laboratory-reared generation was tested for diapause frequency in growth chambers programmed to force most univoltine individuals to enter larval diapause and allow a minimum of 50% of bivoltine individuals to continue development. These results illustrate that bivoltine populations dispersed at least 32 km/yr. The results indicate further that light southerly or easterly surface winds (under 8 km/h) were the essential transport mechanisms for this dispersal. It is probable that bivoltine O. nubilalis have been invading the historically univoltine areas of northwestern Minnesota, North Dakota, and the Canadian prairie provinces from the south for years.

The genome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori (L.), encodes two Met paralogs, BmMet1 and BmMet2. We have previously proposed that BmMet2 forms a functional complex with steroid receptor co-activator (BmSRC) in the presence of JH and induces Kruppel-homolog 1 (BmKr-h1). In this study, we characterized BmMet2 domains and examined the role of BmMet1. A series of reporter and two-hybrid assays on BmMet2 revealed that the bHLH domain played a critical role in the binding to the JH response element of BmKr-h1 (kJHRE), the PAS-A in the transcriptional activation, and the PAS-B in the JH recognition. Furthermore, we confirmed that the BmMet2/BmSRC complex recognizes the core kJHRE (GGCCTCCACGTG). BmMet1 was found to interact with BmSRC and weakly activated the kJHRE reporter in a JH-dependent manner. The BmMet1 transcript level was much higher than the BmMet2 transcript level in the epidermis during the larval and pupal stages. By contrast, the BmMet2 transcript was hardly detected during the larval stage, but was abundant in the adult stage. These results suggest that BmMet1 is involved in the JH-dependent induction of BmKr-h1 in larvae, whereas BmMet2 is involved in adults.

(Asparagales: Asparagaceae) were studied under laboratory conditions to assess their interaction. Development, survival, fecundity, and consumption data were analyzed by the age-stage, two-sex life table. This study indicated that asparagus is a natural host of H. armigera. However, the poor nutritional content in asparagus foliage and the poor fitness of H. armigera that fed on asparagus indicated that asparagus is a suboptimal host in comparison to hybrid sweet corn. The uncertainty associated with life table parameters was estimated by using jackknife and bootstrap techniques, and the results were compared for statistical inference. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), net reproductive rate (R-0), and mean generation time (T) were estimated by the jackknife technique to be 0.0780 day(-1), 1.0811 day(-1), 67.4 offspring, and 54.8 days, respectively, while those estimated by the bootstrap technique were 0.0752 day(-1), 1.0781 day(-1), 68.0 offspring, and 55.3 days, respectively. The net consumption rate of H. armigera, as estimated by the jackknife and bootstrap technique, was 1183.02 and 1132.9 mg per individual, respectively. The frequency distribution of sample means obtained by the jackknife technique failed the normality test, while the bootstrap results fit the normal distribution well. By contrast, the relationship between the mean fecundity and the net reproductive rate, as estimated by the bootstrap technique, was slightly inconsistent with the relationship found by mathematical proof. The application of the jackknife and bootstrap techniques in estimating population parameters requires further examination.

However, few studies have considered the influences of bacteria-plant interactions on insect feeding and oviposition. The objective of this study was to determine how rhizobacterial inoculation of bermudagrass affects larval development and ovipositional behaviors of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda J.E. Smith). Eight blends of rhizobacteria known to induce root or shoot growth in grasses were applied weekly to hybrid bermudagrass for 5 wk. Oviposition was evaluated in two no-choice trials with bacteria-treated, fertilized, or nontreated grass. Grass blades from these treatments were extracted in polar and nonpolar solvents and assayed for oviposition responses. Another experiment compared the development of fall armyworm larvae on bermudagrass treated with each of the eight rhizobacterial blends for 5 wk to larvae fed nontreated bermudagrass. Females deposited more eggs on nontreated and fertilized grass and <= 34% of eggs on grass treated with rhizobacterial blends. Moths exposed to polar and nonpolar extracts were unable to reproduce these results. Larval and pupal weights at days 10 and 12 and the number of adults to eclose were lower for larvae fed some, but not all, bacteria-treated bermudagrass relative to controls. This is one of the few studies to investigate plant-microbe-insect interactions in an economically important system. Although the effects noted with fall armyworm are limited, induced changes in roots also reported for these bacteria may have greater utility than foliar changes for mediating interactions with biotic or abiotic stresses.

Bt susceptibility of the six strains was compared with that of known Cry1Ab-susceptible and -resistant strains of D. saccharalis. At least two of the six strains demonstrated a similar level (>526-fold) of resistance to Cry1Ab as shown in the known Cry1Ab-resistant strain, while resistance levels were relatively lower for other strains (116- to 129-fold). All the six strains were highly cross-resistant to Cry1Aa (71- to 292-fold) and Cry1Ac (30- to 248-fold), but only with a low level to Cry1F (<7-fold). Larval growth of all six strains was also inhibited on Bt-treated diet, but, except for Cry1F, the growth inhibition of the six strains was considerably less than that of the Cry1Ab-susceptible larvae. The results provide clear evidence that the observed resistance to Cry1Ab maize in the six strains is a result of resistance to the Cry1Ab protein in the plants. The low level of cross-resistance between Cry1A and Cry1F suggests that pyramiding these two types of Bt proteins into a plant could be a good strategy for managing D. saccharalis.

Bt Maize Seed Mixtures for Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae): Larval Movement, Development, and Survival on Non-transgenic Maize	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						corn earworm; refuge in the bag; insect resistance management; pollen movement; paternal silencing	RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY; EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; INSECT RESISTANCE; CROSS-POLLINATION; MIXED PLANTINGS; PEST-MANAGEMENT; CROPS; CRAMBIDAE; REFUGES	In 2012 and 2013, field trials were conducted near Rosemount, MN, to assess the movement and development of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) larvae on non-Bt refuge corn plants within a seed mixture of non-Bt and Bt corn. The Bt corn hybrid expressed three Bt toxins-Cry1Ab, Cry1F, and Vip3A. As the use of seed mixtures for insect resistance management (IRM) continues to be implemented, it is necessary to further characterize how this IRM approach impacts resistance development in ear-feeding Lepidopteran pests. The potential for Bt pollen movement and cross pollination of the non-Bt ears in a seed mixture may lead to Bt toxin exposure to larvae developing on those refuge ears. Larval movement and development byH. zea, feeding on non-Bt refuge plants adjacent to either transgenic Bt or non-Bt plants, were measured to investigate the potential for unintended Bt exposure. Non-Bt plants were infested withH. zea eggs and subplots were destructively sampled twice per week within each treatment to assess larval development, location, and kernel injury. Results indicate that H. zea larval movement between plants is relatively low, ranging from 2-16% of larvae, and occurs mainly after reaching the second instar. Refuge plants in seed mixtures did not produce equivalent numbers of H. zea larvae, kernel injury, and larval development differed as compared with a pure stand of non-Bt plants. This suggests that there may be costs to larvae developing on refuge plants within seed mixtures and additional studies are warranted to define potential impacts.	[Burkness, Eric C.; Cira, T.

Caterpillars become infected after ingesting polyhedral occlusion bodies (POB) present in contaminated mulberry leaves and spread through the body after passing the epithelium of the midgut. As this organ is responsible for digestion, most absorption of nutrients requires an intact epithelium to maintain gastrointestinal physiology. Considering the importance of this organ in the feeding of caterpillars and in the production of quality silk threads, and because it is also the first barrier faced by the BmNPV, the study analyzed details of cytopathological events in the intestinal cells as well as evaluated the action of the antioxidant systems as a response to cellular infection. For this purpose, B. mori hybrid caterpillars of fifth instar were inoculated with a suspension of 7.8 x 10(7) POB ml(-1) and, from the first to the eighth day post-inoculation (dpi), segments of the midgut were collected and processed for light and electronic microscopy. The nuclei of columnar cells showed polyhedric occlusion bodies in the seventh dpi and fragmentation of those cells, with peritrophic matrix disorganization. Analysis of antioxidant systems shows some moments of changes of the catalase enzymes and superoxide dismutase. Analysis of the cholinergic system revealed changes only at the beginning of the infection. Thus, the article acknowledges the antioxidant system as a barrier to stop viral infection, albeit it cannot stop infection from occurring, once a coevolutionary bond is maintained between virus and host.

Miskin's holotype is fixed by monotypy and illustrated, with type locality Rockhampton, Queensland. Fixed differences in the mitochondrial genomes of J. eubulus and J. evagoras in which the mean pairwise divergence is only 0.85% indicate absence of matrilineal gene flow, whereas allozyme data show significant structure within and between populations of both species consistent with recent diversification. Underlying causes for the observed genetic patterns are investigated. The two species are parapatric, with a narrow range of overlap along the Great Escarpment in south-eastern Queensland. Jalmenus eubulus is restricted to vegetation communities comprising brigalow-dominated old-growth open-forests and woodlands in the Brigalow Belt (with larvae monophagous on Acacia harpophylla F. Muell. ExBenth), whereas J. evagoras occurs in a range of disturbed eucalypt woodlands/open-forests predominantly in montane and coastal areas east of this bioregion (with larvae polyphagous on Acacia species other than A. harpophylla). The conservation status of J. eubulus is considered to be vulnerable nationally and critically endangered in New South Wales according to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria. Nationally, the geographic range has an estimated area of occupancy of less than 2000 km(2), is severely fragmented, and the extent or quality of its habitat, which is poorly conserved, continues to decline. It is recommended that the taxon be used as an indicator for identification of remnant old-growth forest for conservation planning, as well as a flagship for the conservation of invertebrate biodiversity associated with this threatened ecological community.

J	Tan, JG; McCaffery, AR				Tan, JG; McCaffery, AR			Expression and inheritance of nerve insensitivity resistance in larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) from China	PESTICIDE SCIENCE			English	Article							HELIOTHIS-VIRESCENS F; DIAMONDBACK MOTH LEPIDOPTERA; MUSCA-DOMESTICA L; PYRETHROID RESISTANCE; HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; SYNTHETIC PYRETHROIDS; INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE; PERMETHRIN RESISTANCE; HOUSE-FLIES; SUPER-KDR	Nerve insensitivity resistance to synthetic pyrethroids was detected in a resistant field strain (JSFX-R) of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), using a neurophysiological assay in which extracellular spontaneous neuronal activity was measured in response to cis-cypermethrin. The nerve insensitivity mechanism was selected using a combination of toxicological and neurophysiological methods. The third-instar larvae in selected strains of Family-37 and CTR strain expressed a very high resistance to fenvalerate (RF = 2060-fold and 805-fold, respectively) and high cross-resistance to DDT (RF = 1927-fold and 2384-fold, respectively) which was not affected by two metabolic synergists, PBO and DMC. The frequency of nerve-insensitive individuals detected in neurophysiological assays (54, 81 and 100% for JSFX-R strain, and the selected strains Family-43 and Family-37, respectively) was not only positively correlated (R-2 = 0.968) with the frequency of non-PBO-synergisable resistant individuals detected in toxicological tests (37.5, 62.5 and 90% for JSFX-R strain, Family-43 and Family-37, respectively), but also positively correlated (R-2 = 0.978) with the frequency of DDT-resistant individuals detected in toxicological tests (40, 67.5 and 93.3% for JSFX-R strain, Family-43 and Family-37, respectively). Analysis of dose-mortality Lines to DDT and fenvalerate from F-1 hybrids (R female x S male) indicated that nerve insensitivity resistance to DDT and fenvalerate in the CTR strain was inherited in an incompletely recessive pattern. Degree of dominance (D) was estimated to be -0.66 (+/- 0.06) (DDT) and -0.26 (+/- 0.04) (fenvalerate). The dose-mortality curves to DDT in backcross progeny were strongly suggested, by chi-square analysis, to be fitted with those expected of a one-gene model. Evidence for the co-existence of nerve insensitivity and oxidative metabolic resistance mechanisms within individual H armigera and the effects of their interaction on the expression of resistance to fenvalerate are discussed.

(Lepidoptera : Bombycidae) cocoons	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY			Portuguese	Article						sericiculture; natural diet; varietal selection		The success of sericiculture greatly depends on the availability of mulberry cultivars with agronomic characteristics that maximize the production and quality of silkworm, Bombyx mori L., cocoons. The effect of the cultivars Miura (standard) and Korin, and the hybrids SM 14, SM 63, SK 1, SK 4 and FM 86 was evaluated on silkworm development, and on cocoon production and quality, at the Instituto Agronomico do Parand, INPAR, in Londrina, PR, Brazil (23 +/- 3 degrees C; 61 +/- 8% RH). The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four replicates. Larvae feeding either on 'SK 4' or on 'Korin' showed a higher weight compared to that of larvae feeding on 'Miura". Cocoon weight (both sexes) and pupae weight (male) obtained with larvae fed on SK 4 were higher compared with that of insects that fed on 'Miura'; there was no difference among the remaining treatments. Silk net weight was independent of the cultivar used. Cocoon shell weight was similar amongst insects raised on 'Miura' and on the other mulberry materials. The percentage of cocoon spinning was higher than 90% in all treatments, with the spinning concentrating in the first two days. The proportion of first grade cocoons varied from 80% (SK4) to 90%. The results obtained with the studied cultivars were either similar or superior to that of the standard cultivar Miura with emphasis to 'SK 4', thus showing the potential use of these cultivars in sericulture in the state of Parand.

However, natural hybrids occasionally occur among some closely related species in the same habitat, and host preference, extreme climate stress, and geographic isolation probably lead to their uncertain taxonomic consensus. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of D. houi was extracted and sequenced by using high-throughput technology, and the mitogenome composition and characteristics were compared and analyzed of these species, then the phylogenetic relationship was constructed using the maximum likelihood method (ML) and the Bayesian method (BI) based on their 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) dataset, which were combined and made available to download which were combined and made available to download among global Lasiocampidae species data. Mitogenome of D. houi was 15,373 bp in length, with 37 genes, including 13 PCGs, 22 tRNA genes (tRNAs) and 2 rRNA genes (rRNAs). The positions and sequences of genes were consistent with those of most known Lasiocampidae species. The nucleotide composition was highly A+T biased, accounting for similar to 80% of the whole mitogenome. All start codons of PCGs belonged to typical start codons ATN except for COI which used CGA, and most stop codons ended with standard TAA or TAG, while COI, COII, ND4 ended with incomplete T. Only tRNA(Ser (AGN)) lacked DHU arm, while the remainder formed a typical "clover-shaped" secondary structure. For Lasiocampidae species, their complete mitochondrial genomes ranged from 15,281 to 15,570 bp in length, and all first genes started from trnM in the same direction. And base composition was biased toward A and T. Finally, both two methods (ML and BI) separately revealed that the same phylogenetic relationship of D. spp. as ((((D. punctatus + D. tabulaeformis) + D. spectabilis) + D. superans) + (D. kikuchii of Hunan population + D. houi) as in previous research, but results were different in that D. kikuchii from a Yunnan population was included, indicating that different geographical populations of insects have differentiated. And the phylogenetic relationship among Lasiocampidae species was ((((Dendrolimus) + Kunugia) + Euthrix) + Trabala). This provides a better theoretical basis for Lasiocampidae evolution and classification for future research directions.

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Larvae	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						fall armyworm; larval feeding; maize; cultivars; host-plant resistance; Africa		The fall armyworm (FAW) has recently invaded and become an important pest of maize in Africa causing yield losses reaching up to a third of maize annual production. The present study evaluated different aspects of resistance of six maize cultivars, cropped by farmers in Kenya, to FAW larvae feeding under laboratory and field conditions. We assessed the arrestment and feeding of FAW neonate larvae in no-choice and choice experiments, development of larvae-pupae, food assimilation under laboratory conditions and plant damage in a field experiment. We did not find complete resistance to FAW feeding in the evaluated maize cultivars, but we detected differences in acceptance and preference when FAW larvae were given a choice between certain cultivars. Moreover, the smallest pupal weight and the lowest growth index were found on 'SC Duma 43' leaves, which suggests an effect of antibiosis of this maize hybrid against FAW larvae. In contrast, the highest growth index was recorded on 'Rachar' and the greatest pupal weight was found on 'Nyamula' and 'Rachar'. The density of trichomes on the leaves of these maize cultivars seems not to be directly related to the preference of neonates for feeding. Plant damage scores were not statistically different between cultivars in the field neither under natural nor artificial infestation. However, plant damage scores in 'Nyamula' and 'Jowi' tended to be lower in the two last samplings of the season compared to the two initial samplings under artificial infestation. Our study provides insight into FAW larval preferences and performance on some African maize cultivars, showing that there are differences between cultivars in these variables; but high levels of resistance to larvae feeding were not found.

Peter			Transgenic upregulation of the condensed tannin pathway in poplar leads to a dramatic shift in leaf palatability for two tree-feeding Lepidoptera	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Plant-insect interaction; Plant defense; Phenolic glycoside; Defoliator; Geneticmodification; Populus; Aspen; Salicinoid	QUAKING ASPEN; GYPSY MOTHS; HERBIVORE; PERFORMANCE; RESISTANCE; COMMUNITIES; METABOLISM; CHEMISTRY; GENOMICS; DEFENSE	Transgenic hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x tremuloides) overexpressing the MYB134 tannin regulatory gene show dramatically enhanced condensed tannin (proanthocyanidin) levels, as well as shifts in other phenolic metabolites. A series of insect bioassays with forest tent caterpillars (Malacosoma disstria) and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillars was carried out to determine how this metabolic shift affects food preference and performance of generalist tree-feeding lepidopterans. Both species showed a distinct preference for the high-tannin MYB134 overexpressor plants, and L. dispar performance was enhanced relative to controls. L. dispar reached greater pupal weight and showed reduced time to pupation when reared on the MYB134 overexpressing poplar. These results were unexpected since enhanced condensed tannin levels were predicted to act as feeding deterrents. However, the data may be explained by the observed decrease in the salicinoids (phenolic glycosides) salicortin and tremulacin that accompanied the upregulation of the condensed tannins in the transgenics. We conclude that for these two lepidopteran species, condensed tannin levels are unlikely to be a major determinant of caterpillar food preference or performance. However, our experiments show that overexpression of a single regulatory gene in transgenic aspen can have a significant impact on herbivorous insects.	[Boeckler, G.

Gypsy moth larvae that were parasitized by C. melanoscela strains from France and South Korea, and an unparasitized control group, were allowed to develop on foliage from 5 tree species (red oak, tamarack, sugar maple, hybrid poplar clone NC5271, and white pine) and synthetic diet. Food plant had a significant effect on gypsy moth relative growth, development time, and pupal weight. Gypsy moth food plant affected C. melanoscela development time and size. Host plant influenced percentage of parasitism, but this effect varied between blocks. Parasitoid strain was a major factor in development time, size, and host selection, but was of marginal influence on parasitism rates and sex ratio. Plant suitability to gypsy moth, both in host species and phenology, was the strongest underlying factor in C. melanoscela parasitoid success, development time, and size. Plant and strain effects on C. melanoscela may be important factors in guiding biological control efforts against gypsy moth.

The mutagenic action of ionizing radiation was well known in the field of genetics long before it was realized by entomologists that it might be used to induce dominant lethal mutations in insects, which, when released, could sterilize wild female insects. The use of radiation to induce dominant lethal mutations in the sterile insect technique (SIT) is now a major component of many large and successful programs for pest suppression and eradication. Adult insects, and their different developmental stages, differ in their sensitivity to the induction of dominant lethal mutations, and care has to be taken to identify the appropriate dose of radiation that produces the required level of sterility without impairing the overall fitness of the released insect. Sterility can also be introduced into populations through genetic mechanisms, including translocations, hybrid incompatibility, and inherited sterility in Lepidoptera. The latter phenomenon is due to the fact that this group of insects has holokinetic chromosomes. Specific types of mutations can also be used to make improvements to the SIT, especially for the development of strains for the production of only male insects for sterilization and release. These strains utilize male translocations and a variety of selectable mutations, either conditional or visible, so that at some stage of development, the males can be separated from the females. In one major insect pest, Ceratitis capitata, these strains are used routinely in large operational programs. This review summarizes these developments, including the possible future use of transgenic technology in pest control, (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Suzuki, MG; Shimada, T; Kobayashi, M				Suzuki, MG; Shimada, T; Kobayashi, M			Bm kettin, homologue of the Drosophila kettin gene, is located on the Z chromosome in Bombyx mori and is not dosage compensated	HEREDITY			English	Article						Bombyx mori; dosage compensation; female heterogamety; kettin; sex-linked gene; Z chromosome	SEX-LINKED ENZYME; BUTTERFLIES; SEQUENCE	In Bombyx mori, the female is the heterogametic sex and the sex determining system is referred to as ZZ/ZW. In a previous study, we found that this insect does not show dosage compensation at the transcriptional level. To confirm the validity of our conclusion, we investigated whether or not another sex-linked gene is dosage compensated. To identify new Z-linked genes, total RNA from reciprocal hybrid females between the silkworm strains p50 and C108 was compared using the differential display technique. Nine cDNA fragments corresponding to several differentially expressed mRNAs were cloned and sequenced. The analysis of nucleotide sequence polymorphisms confirmed that one of these cDNAs, ZDD4, originated from the Z chromosome. The amino acid sequence deduced from ZDD4 has homology with kettin, a modular protein in the Z-disc of Drosophila melanogaster muscles. On immunoblots of Bombyx larval muscle proteins a polypeptide of 380 kDa was labelled with antibody to the ZDD4 peptide. We considered that the gene corresponding to ZDD4 encodes a kettin homologue in the silkworm, and denote it as Bm kettin. By a three-point cross, Bm kettin was mapped at 40.0 CM on the Z chromosome. Southern blot analysis revealed that Bm kettin was present at one copy in the genome. Northern blot analysis showed that Bm kettin mRNA was 9.1kb in length, and that the level of the mRNA in males was two times greater than that of females. Taken together with our previous observations, the present data suggest that lack of dosage compensation is a general rule in B. mori. Moreover, the twofold difference in Bm kettin expression between males and females may help explain the sexual difference in the wing flapping activity observed in some groups of Lepidoptera.

Evaluation of the impact of the toxic protein Cry1Ab expressed by the genetically modified cultivar MON810 on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) behavior	MEDYCYNA WETERYNARYJNA-VETERINARY MEDICINE-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article						bees; pollinators; agroecosystem; MON810; Cry	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS TOXIN; INSECTICIDAL PROTEINS; HYPOPHARYNGEAL GLANDS; POLLINATOR DECLINES; TRYPSIN-INHIBITOR; TRANSGENIC PLANTS; BT-TOXIN; POLLEN; BUMBLEBEES; WORLD	Pollinators play a crucial role in natural ecosystems by maintaining both the biodiversity of wild plants and agricultural activity. In modern agriculture health problems affecting honey bee populations have resulted in an increased exploitation of alternative pollinators such as bumblebees. When Bt products are used, either as sprays or transgenic crops, non-target organisms such as pollinators may be exposed to the Cry proteins via contact or through ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar. The cultivation of transgenic crops, e.g. maize, raises concerns among different social groups. Even in scientific bee journals there have appeared articles saying that bees might avoid collecting pollen and/or nectar from such plants. Therefore, the aim of our research was to assess the potential negative influence of the genetically modified maize MON810 expressing Cry1Ab - a protein toxic to the most serious lepidopteran pest, the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) [Hubner] (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) - on the behavior of the honey bee in conditions of the limited possible choice of a host plant. The insect material was one honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) family in a hive, which included a queen and approximately 800 worker bees. The honey bees were from the Apiculture Division, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences. The plant material consisted of transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) plants DKC3421 Yield Gard (event MON810) from the Monsanto Company (St. Louis, MO, USA), expressing a gene encoding a truncated form of the Cry1Ab protein derived from B. thuringiensis Berliner, and the corresponding near-isogenic hybrid (DKC 3420). This research has not revealed any significant differences in the number of honey bees visiting the two maize cultivars that would be caused by the potential negative impact of the genetically modified maize MON810.

One promising approach toward restoring American chestnut to natural forests is development of blight-tolerant trees using genetic transformation. However, transformation and related processes can result in unexpected and unintended phenotypic changes, potentially altering ecological interactions. To assess unintended tritrophic impacts of transgenic American chestnut on plant-herbivore interactions, gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) caterpillars were fed leaf disks excised from two transgenic events, Darling 54 and Darling 58, and four control American chestnut lines. Leaf disks were previously treated with an LD50 dose of either the species-specific Lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) or the generalist pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk). Mortality was quantified and compared to water blank controls. Tree genotype had a strong effect on the efficacies of both pathogens. Larval mortality from Btk-treated foliage from only one transgenic event, Darling 54, differed from its isogenic progenitor, Ellis 1, but was similar to an unrelated wild-type American chestnut control. LdMNPV efficacy was unaffected by genetic transformation. Results suggest that although genetic modification of trees may affect interactions with other nontarget organisms, this may be due to insertion effects, and variation among different genotypes (whether transgenic or wild-type) imparts a greater change in response than transgene presence.

Invasions of insect pests and fungal pathogens of woody plants into the northwestern part of European Russia	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES			Russian	Article						invasive insects; woody plants; European part of Russia	EMERALD ASH BORER; DUTCH ELM DISEASE; DIEBACK; GRACILLARIIDAE; LEPIDOPTERA; HISTORY	Invasions of insects and fungi is a serious problem for the existence of woody plants in the northwest of the European part of Russia. The following species of moths (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) that produce mines in the leaves of woody plants recently arrived in the region: Phyllonorycter issikii (feeding on lime), Cameraria ohridella (feeding on chestnut), and, likely, Acrocercops brongniardella (feeding on oak). Increasing average monthly temperatures during the growing season is a favorable factor which can promote the spread of pests and pathogens and increase their population density The particularly warm season of 2018 likely contributed to the noticeable increase in the population density of the invasive mining moths as well as the adventive poplar mining moth Phyllonorycter populifoliella. Spreading species of stem-boring and bark beetles, as well as diseases associated with them, might be particularly dangerous; in particular, Scolytus spp. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are involved in spreading Dutch elm disease (caused by Ophiostoma novo-ulmi). It has been demonstrated that hybrids of Oph. novo-ulmi are spread in the region and can be highly pathogenic. Emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is another serious potential aggressive invader. The northwestern border of its invasive range is currently in the environs of the city of Tver, but its arrival by highways, with transport or planting materials to the northwest of the European part of Russia is likely. The recent invasion of the ascomycete Hymenoscyphus fraxineus has already led to a noticeable deterioration of the condition of ash trees in Saint Petersburg and the Leningrad Region. The combined effect of the buprestid beetle A. planipennis and fungus El. fraxineus can have fatal consequences for ash. It is necessary to continue monitoring invasive species range dynamics and studying their adaptation to local conditions and the interaction of invasive insects with local and invasive woody plant pathogenic organisms.

The inheritance of resistance to a carbamate insecticide was measured in adults of a resistant population of the Oriental fruit moth (OFM), Grapholita molesta (Busck), a destructive pest of peach in northeastern North America. The inheritance of variations in inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in susceptible and resistant OFM adults was determined and quantitative measurements were made of total acetylcholinesterase and nonspecific esterase activity. Resistance and acetylcholinesterase inhibition were linked to the sex chromosome and were shown to be highly correlated (r(2) > 0.91), suggesting that the mutant acetylcholinesterase was the basis for most of the observed resistance in adults. Levels of nonspecific esterase activity were 2.0- to 4.8-fold higher in resistant than in susceptible OFM and twice as high in males as in females, but there was no evidence that this resistance factor was sex linked. Results of bioassays of susceptible, resistant, and F-1 hybrid OFM indicated that resistance appeared to be incompletely recessive in all F-1 males and in females of the (R female X S male) F-1 progenies. In contrast, resistance appeared to be intermediate in daughters of resistant males mated with susceptible females (S female X R male). Because of the lack of effective alternative control strategies, the identification of actual or potential resistance mechanisms and its genetic basis in actual pests are needed to maximize and predict the likelihood of success in resistance management programs.

Establishment of cotesia flavipes (Hymenoptera : braconidae) in sugarcane fields of Ethiopia and origin of founding population	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Cotesia flavipes; Chilo partellus; Ethiopia; COI; sugarcane	CHILO-PARTELLUS SWINHOE; STEM-BORERS LEPIDOPTERA; CAMERON HYMENOPTERA; APANTELES-FLAVIPES; HOST SELECTION; SESAMIAE HYMENOPTERA; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; SUITABILITY; STEMBORERS; NOCTUIDAE	Cotesia flavipes (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is used as a classical biological control agent against Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), a serious exotic pest of cereal crops in eastern and southern Africa. This parasitoid has been introduced into several African countries for the control of C. partellus in maize, Zea mays L., and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.), but it has never been released in Ethiopia. It is hypothesized that it spread into Ethiopia from populations released in Kenya and Somalia to become the predominant parasitoid of C. partellus in maize and sorghum fields of the country. In recent surveys conducted in Ethiopia, C. flavipes was recovered from C. partellus in sugarcane, Saccharum L. spp. hybrids, at a site > 2,000 km from the nearest known release sites in Kenya and Somalia. These findings question published hypotheses that estimate the dispersal rate of C. flavipes to be 60 kin per year in Africa, and they suggest that since its release in Africa this parasitoid has developed strains adapted to searching particular host plants infested by particular stem borers. The anomalies between our results and previous reports evoked the hypothesis that C. flavipes in Ethiopian sugarcane might be a different strain. To test this hypothesis, we compared partial COI gene sequences of C. flavipes collected from sugarcane in Ethiopia and those of specimens from other African countries to determine the origin of the Ethiopian population. In addition, COI sequences were obtained for C. flavipes from other continents. The C. flavipes population established in Ethiopian sugarcane is most closely related to the populations released against C. partellus in maize in other parts of Africa, which were derived from the original population imported from Pakistan. The dispersal rate of the parasitoid was estimated to be > 200 km per year.	[Assefa, Y.; Conlong, D.

Cross-resistance of Cry1Ab-selected Asian corn borer to other Cry toxins	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bacillus thuringiensis; Ostrinia furnacalis; Bt maize; cross-resistance; Cry proteins	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS TOXINS; HELIOTHIS-VIRESCENS LEPIDOPTERA; INSECTICIDAL CRYSTAL PROTEINS; MOTH PLUTELLA-XYLOSTELLA; BASE-LINE SUSCEPTIBILITY; BT-TRANSGENIC CROPS; SUBSP-KURSTAKI; HELICOVERPA-ARMIGERA; OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS; DELTA-ENDOTOXINS	The Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is the most important insect pest of maize in China. Despite the proven track record of biotech Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize to provide an effective means to control lepidopteran pests such as the European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), these crops have not been commercialized in China. However, Cry1Ab- and Cry1F-expressing maize derived from genetic transformation events MON810 (Monsanto), Bt11 (Syngenta) and TC1507 (Pioneer, DuPont) as well as Cry1Ah-, Cry1A- (a Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac hybrid toxin), and Cry1Ac-, Cry1Ie-expressing maize developed by the Chinese institutions have been shown to effectively suppress O. furnacalis in field trials. The development of resistance in target pests is a major threat to the use of Bt maize. A strain of O. furnacalis selected with Cry1Ab protein incorporated into artificial diet developed more than 100-fold resistance to Cry1Ab after 35 generations of selection, and readily consumed Cry1Ab-expressing maize silks. Although LC(50)s of the selected insect strain were not progressively increased, and even decreased in the following generations, these insects (ACB-AbR) could survive on Cry1Ab-expressing maize tissue after 51 generations of selection. In addition, susceptibility of ACB-AbR to a number of other Bt toxins to which the selected strains had not previously been exposed, was significantly decreased. The highest level of cross-resistance was observed with Cry1Ah (131-fold), followed by Cry1Ac (36-fold). A low level of cross-resistance (6-fold) to Cry1F was also detected. In contrast, ACB-AbR was equally susceptible to Cry1Ie as the unselected control strain. These results indicate that the availability of multiple toxins could improve resistance management strategies, provided that the potential for cross-resistance among toxins is not an issue.

The Phylogenetics and Biogeography of the Central Asian Hawkmoths, Hyles hippophaes and H. chamyla: Can Mitogenomics and Machine Learning Bring Clarity?	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						molecular ecology; deep; machine learning; morphological analysis	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; BODY-SIZE; LEPIDOPTERA; EVOLUTION; SPHINGIDAE; ASSOCIATION; FORMAT	The western Palaearctic species of the hawkmoth genus Hyles (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) have long been the subject of molecular phylogenetic research. However, much less attention has been paid to the taxa inhabiting the central and eastern Palaearctic, particularly Central Asia, where almost 50% of the species diversity of the genus occurs. Yet, many taxonomic conundrums hinder a proper assessment of the true diversity in these moths. One still unresolved group of species includes Hyles hippophaes and Hyles chamyla. Despite a largely overlapping morphology and ecology, a plethora of infraspecific taxa display some unique divergent characters over a wide geographical area. In this study, we undertook a taxonomic assessment of each population and resolved this species complex using an integrative approach. A combination of new computational techniques (DAISY-II) in comparative morphology and recent advances in DNA extraction methods and sequencing of museum specimens (WISC) alongside more traditional genetic approaches allowed testing of the three main phenotypes-bienerti, chamyla and apocyni-in terms of their morphological, mitochondrial and biogeographical integrity, and to elucidate their evolutionary relationships. Our results support the existence of two closely related species, Hyles chamyla and H. hippophaes, but the former species H. apocyni (here discussed as the ecological form apocyni of H. chamyla) is best regarded as a hybrid between H. chamyla and H. h. bienerti. The results indicate that the evolutionary relationship between H. chamyla and H. hippophaes is one of admixture in the context of ongoing ecological differentiation, which has led to shared morphological characters and a blurring of the species boundaries. These results clarify the evolutionary relationships of this species complex and open future research lines, including the analysis of nuclear markers and denser sampling, particularly of H. hippophaes and H. vespertilio in western Europe.

Selection of processing tomato genotypes with high acyl sugar content that are resistant to the tomato pinworm	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Solanum pennellii; Allelochemical; Tuta absoluta; Pest resistance	INHERITANCE; TRICHOMES; BIOLOGY; HYBRIDS	Acyl sugars are allelochemicals present at high concentrations in leaves of accessions of the wild tomato Solanum pennellii; they confer resistance to a large number of arthropod pests, including the tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae). Accession 'LA716', with high contents of acyl sugars in the leaves, was used as a source of resistance to start a genetic breeding program of processing cultivated tomato, S. lycopersicum. We selected plants of the F-2 generation of an interspecific cross (S. lycopersicum cv. 'Redencao' x S. pennellii 'LA716') for extremes of concentrations (high and low) of acyl sugars in the leaves and evaluated the resistance of selected genotypes to the tomato pinworm, compared with plants of the parental and F-1 generations. The concentrations of acyl sugars present in the genotypes selected for high contents were close to those of S. pennellii 'LA 716', while the genotypes with low concentrations of acyl sugars were close to cultivar 'Redencao'. The F-1 hybrid ('Redencao' x 'LA716') had intermediate concentrations of acyl sugars, but was closer to Redencao, indicating that the inheritance of this type of character is due to a recessive major gene, along with minor genes with additive effects. There was a direct association between high contents of acyl sugars and non-preference for oviposition and suppression of larval development, indicating that the allelochemical acts through mechanisms of non-preference for oviposition and through antibiosis. Genotypes with high contents of acyl sugars were more effective in reducing the damage caused by the tomato pinworm. Genotypes RVTA-2010pl#94 and RVTA-2010pl#31, selected for high contents of acyl sugars, showed a good level of resistance to T. absoluta, similar to the wild genotype LA716. These genotypes are promising for use in a breeding program for developing commercial processing tomatoes.	[Dias, D. M.; Resende, J. T. V.; Faria, M. V.; Camargo, L. K. P.; Chagas, R. R.; Lima, I.

Cross-resistance between the Mexican Rice Borer and the Sugarcane Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae): A Case Study Using Sugarcane Breeding Populations	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							YIELD; PYRALIDAE	The sugarcane borer (SCB) [Diatraea saccharalis (F.)] and Mexican rice borer (MRB) [Eoreuma loftini (Dyar)] are two economically important pests of sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) in the United States. Because of similarities in larval feeding behavior, selecting for resistance to one species could provide resistance to the other, a phenomenon we have termed "cross-resistance". The objective of this study was to determine if SCB-resistance in sugarcane is correlated with resistance to MRB. Thirty genotypes from Louisiana previously identified as either resistant or susceptible to the SCB and 50 from Texas with unknown resistance status to either species were evaluated for percent borer-damaged internodes. Data from the SCB-resistant and-susceptible genotypes were used to determine the SOB-resistance status of all 80 genotypes. Similar (P = 0.578) levels of MRB damage were found between the Louisiana and Texas population, whereas, the Louisiana population suffered significantly (P < 0.05) less SOB damage compared to the Texas population. The SOB-resistant genotypes suffered significantly (P < 0.01) less damage from the MRB compared to their susceptible counterparts. A significant (P < 0.001) association was found in percent SOB and MRB-damaged internodes among the Louisiana and the SOB-resistant populations but not among the Texas or SOB-susceptible populations. Furthermore, the SOB-resistant genotypes were 40% less likely than susceptible ones to be bored by the MRB. Resources developed for SOB-resistance could form the foundation material to breed for resistance to both pests.

Contribution of ergot alkaloids to suppression of a grass-feeding caterpillar assessed with gene knockout endophytes in perennial ryegrass	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						Ascomycota; Clavicipitaceae; Neotyphodium; defensive mutualism; host-plant resistance; ergovaline; Lolium perenne; black cutworm; Agrotis ipsilon; tritrophic interaction	ARGENTINE STEM WEEVIL; FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; BLACK CUTWORM LEPIDOPTERA; TALL FESCUE; FUNGAL ENDOPHYTE; INFECTED GRASSES; NEOTYPHODIUM ENDOPHYTE; MEDIATED RESISTANCE; LOLITREM-B; ERGOVALINE	Neotyphodium and Epichloe species (Ascomycota: Clavicipitaceae) are fungal symbionts (endophytes) of grasses. Many of these endophytes produce alkaloids that enhance their hosts' resistance to insects or are toxic to grazing mammals. The goals of eliminating from forage grasses factors such as ergot alkaloids that are responsible for livestock disorders, while retaining pasture sustainability, and of developing resistant turf grasses, require better understanding of how particular alkaloids affect insect herbivores. We used perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L. (Poaceae) symbiotic with Neotyphodium lolii x Epichloe typhina isolate Lp1 (a natural interspecific hybrid), as well as with genetically modified strains of Lp1 with altered ergot alkaloid profiles, to test effects of ergot alkaloids on feeding, growth, and survival of the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a generalist grass-feeding caterpillar. Neonates or late instars were provided clippings from glasshouse-grown plants in choice and rearing trials. Wild-type endophytic grass showed strong antixenosis and antibiosis, especially to neonates. Plant-endophyte symbiota from which complex ergot alkaloids (ergovaline and lysergic acid amides such as ergine) or all ergot alkaloids were eliminated by endophyte gene knockout retained significant resistance against neonates. However, this activity was reduced compared to that of wild-type Lp1, providing the first direct genetic evidence that ergot alkaloids contribute to insect resistance of endophytic grasses. Similarity of larval response to the two mutants suggested that ergovaline and/or ergine account for the somewhat greater potency of wild-type Lp1 compared to the knockouts, whereas simpler ergot alkaloids contribute little to that added resistance. All of the endophyte strains also produced peramine, which was probably their primary resistance component. This study suggests that ergot alkaloids can be eliminated from an endophyte of perennial ryegrass while retaining significant insect resistance.	[Potter, Daniel A.; Stokes, J.

Hidden Phylogenomic Signal Helps Elucidate Arsenurine Silkmoth Phylogeny and the Evolution of Body Size and Wing Shape Trade-Offs	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							GENETIC-BASIS; LEPIDOPTERA; MOTHS; BATS; MORPHOLOGY; TREE; DIVERSIFICATION; SATURNIIDAE; BUTTERFLIES; PREDATION	One of the key objectives in biological research is understanding how evolutionary processes have produced Earth's diversity. A critical step toward revealing these processes is an investigation of evolutionary tradeoffs-that is, the opposing pressures of multiple selective forces. For millennia, nocturnal moths have had to balance successful flight, as they search for mates or host plants, with evading bat predators. However, the potential for evolutionary trade-offs between wing shape and body size are poorly understood. In this study, we used phylogenomics and geometric morphometrics to examine the evolution of wing shape in the wild silkmoth subfamily Arsenurinae (Saturniidae) and evaluate potential evolutionary relationships between body size and wing shape. The phylogeny was inferred based on 782 loci from target capture data of 42 arsenurine species representing all 10 recognized genera. After detecting in our data one of the most vexing problems in phylogenetic inference-a region of a tree that possesses short branches and no "support" for relationships (i.e., a polytomy), we looked for hidden phylogenomic signal (i.e., inspecting differing phylogenetic inferences, alternative support values, quartets, and phylogenetic networks) to better illuminate the most probable generic relationships within the subfamily. We found there are putative evolutionary trade-offs between wing shape, body size, and the interaction of fore- and hindwing (HW) shape. Namely, body size tends to decrease with increasing HW length but increases as forewing (FW) shape becomes more complex. Additionally, the type of HW (i.e., tail or no tail) a lineage possesses has a significant effect on the complexity of FW shape. We outline possible selective forces driving the complex HW shapes that make Arsenurinae, and silkmoths as a whole, so charismatic.

Predator Preference for Bt-Fed Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Prey: Implications for Insect Resistance Management in Bt Maize Seed Blends	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Cry1Ab; fall armyworm; multicolored Asian lady beetle; Harmonia axyridis; resistance management	COLORADO POTATO BEETLE; EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; HARMONIA-AXYRIDIS; ARANEAE THERIDIIDAE; TRANSGENIC CROPS; FITNESS COSTS; COLEOPTERA; LARVAE; COCCINELLIDAE; LADYBIRD	Understanding indirect, trophic-level effects of genetically engineered plants, expressing insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), is essential to the ecological risk assessment process. In this study, we examine potential indirect, trophic-level effects of Bt-sensitive prey using the predator, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), feeding upon Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) larvae, which had delayed development (lower body mass) following ingestion of Cry1Ab maize leaves. We found no adverse effects on development and survival when H. axyridis larvae were fed S. frugiperda larvae that had fed on Cry1Ab maize tissue. Presence of Cry1Ab in H. axyridis decreased considerably after switching to another diet within 48 h. In a no-choice assay, H. axyridis larvae consumed more Bt-fed S. frugiperda than non-Bt-fed larvae. Preference for S. frugiperda feeding on Bt maize was confirmed in subsequent choice assays with H. axyridis predation on Bt-fed, 1-5-d-old S. frugiperda larvae. We suggest that H. axyridis preferred prey, not based on whether it had fed on Bt or non-Bt maize, but rather on larval mass, and they compensated for the nutritional deficiency of lighter larvae through increased consumption. Pest larvae with variable levels of resistance developing on Bt diet are often stunted versus sensitive larvae developing on non-Bt diet. It is possible that such larvae may be preferentially removed from local field populations. These results may have implications for insect resistance management and may be played out under field conditions where seed blends of Bt and non-Bt hybrids are planted.	[Svobodova, Z.; Habustova, O.

The antixenosis and antibiosis components of resistance to this pest in five Gossypium hirsutum (HS 6, HHH 81, PCHH 31, Somnath, SS 9) and one Gossypium arboreum (HD 107) genotypes were undertaken at 28+/-2degreesC and 70+/-5% relative humidity under laboratory conditions. The larval period ranged from 8.2 to 9.2 days on buds and 9.2-12.2 days on bolls of different cotton genotypes. The mean larval period irrespective of food was significantly shorter in G. arboreum as compared to G. hirsutum cultivars. Pre-oviposition period (2.42 days) was longer on G. arboreum genotype than on G. hirsutum genotypes (1.44-2.00 days), while the reverse was true for oviposition and post-oviposition periods. Larval survival, pupation, adult emergence, fecundity, incubation period, and egg hatchability were significantly lower on G. arboreum than on G. hirsutum. The first- and third-instar larvae of spotted bollworm preferred buds than bolls in both, G. arboreum and G. hirsutum genotypes. Multi-choice assays on larval preference for buds and bolls among different genotypes revealed that the preference for buds of G. arboreum was significantly higher by the first-instar and lower by the third-instar larvae than the G. hirsutum variety and hybrids. G. hirsutum cultivars were more preferred than the G. arboreum variety, and among the plant parts the lower leaf surface, buds and bolls were preferred over the other plant parts for egg laying by the female. The interactions between E vittella larvae and cotton genotypes are quite diverse, and there is a distinct possibility for increasing the levels and diversifying the basis of resistance to this pest by intensive breeding program.

Resistance in this strain allows survival at high toxin concentrations that kill. all susceptible individuals, and permits rapid growth at lower sublethal concentrations that inhibit growth of susceptibles. To quantify the number and relative effects of loci contributing to rapid growth on low concentrations of toxin, a genetic linkage analysis was done with markers on 10 of the 31 chromosomes of H. virescens in a backcross design. Linkage group 9 (marker locus MPI) contributed as much as 80% of the total resistance to Cry1Ac growth inhibition in YHD2. Recombination between the resistance locus or loci and the marker locus used to identify linkage group 9 occurred only when the informative hybrid parent was the father, which was expected because crossing-over does not occur in H. virescens females. Linkage group 11 (marker locus GDA) made a smaller contribution to resistance that was only detectable when the effect of Linkage group 9 was removed. In addition to the effects of these 2 linkage groups, slight but significant differences between families suggested that additional unlinked loci had minor effects on resistance. Measurements of the resistance levels conferred by a small number of genes with the largest effects may be useful in predicting the selection response of H. virescens in the field following the release of transgenic cotton expressing B. thuringiensis toxins.

This model has been successfully employed to study the resistance or susceptibility against pathogens and/or toxins. It had been demonstrated that the skin contact with Lonomia obliqua caterpillar bristles induces local inflammation and may elicit severe hemorrhagic disorders. In the present study, blood coagulation time, and the acute inflammatory reaction were scored 24 h after injection of the Lonomia bristles crude extract in a subcutaneous dorsal air pouch. The acute inflammation was determined by the leukocyte concentration in the local exudates. The highest interline differences were observed between the AIR(MAX) (10(6) cells/ml) and AIR(MIN) (2 x 10(5) cells/ml) and this distinct expression involves the number of monocytes, eosinophils and mainly neutrophils. Regarding coagulation, the highest interline difference was observed between the H-III and L-III mice, and the F-1 [L-III x H-III] hybrids showed the overdominance of the fast clotting character. The adaptative immune response was evaluated by comparing the anti-Lonomia bristle extract IgG titer among the lines: the antibody titers were higher in the H lines than in the L ones and equivalent in the AIR(MAX) and AIR(MIN) mice, in accordance to the phenotype profiles generated by the distinct selective processes. The genetically selected mice lines-AIR(MAX), AIR(MIN), H-I, H-III, H-G, L-III and L-G-showed an almost continuous distributions for inflammation, coagulation time and IgG antibody titers, being the interline variances always higher than the intraline ones for the individually measured phenotypes. Altogether, these results suggest the independent polygenic regulation of these traits, being indicative of the genetic control to Lonomia toxin innate and adaptative sensitivity in humans.

Therefore, we studied the butterfly Maniola jurtina as a model for this group. The species has two major genetic lineages (mean genetic distance between lineages: 0.033; F-CT: 0.052), most probably evolving in glacial differentiation centres in the western and eastern Mediterranean. The onset of this differentiation might have been the beginning of the last glacial stage maximum some 40 kyr BP. A hybrid zone between these two lineages exists in western Central Europe. No genetic substructures have been found within the two lineages (F-SC: 0.017) and average genetic distances are very small. Therefore, it is highly probable that postglacial expansion was of the phalanx type. There is, at most, very limited differentiation at regional and local scales. However, the genetic diversity within populations is high (means: A: 2.68; H-E: 17.2%; P: 78%), as would be predicted for such a common species. Comparison of these results with a published allozyme analysis revealed a similar phylogeographical pattern, but lower genetic diversity in the latter. Morphological patterns of wings and genitalia show similar geographical patterns as allozyme data. (c) 2005 The Linnean Society of London.

In 2017 and 2018, each field was sampled four times during the summer for D. saccharalis by inspecting 100 sugarcane stalks and for foraging ants using plastic tubes baited with hot dog at 12 locations. One non-parasitized D. saccharalis larva was collected in 2017 and in 2018 out of 12,100 and 12,600 stalks sampled, respectively. Additional sampling of 50 stalks per field in October showed that 0.6% (2017) and 0.1% (2018) of the sugarcane stalks had bored internodes, and one Cotesia flavipes (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) cocoon mass was observed. Seven ant species foraged in sugarcane fields, including the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, which was the most abundant ant. Solenopsis invicta was not affected by soil type; however, sugarcane fields on shallow organic soils might represent a more suitable environment. The third most abundant foraging ant, Nylanderia bourbonica (Forel), was more abundant in mineral soil fields than in shallow and deep organic soil fields. Results suggest that D. saccharalis population levels in Florida sugarcane are extremely low under current production conditions regardless of soil type. In addition, the observation of C. flavipes, S. invicta, and six other ant species suggest that biological control contributes to these low D. saccharalis population levels.

Fifteen of the 18 field populations were collected from seven locations across Louisiana and the other three populations were sampled from the Gulf Coast area of Texas during 2004-2006. Neonates of D. saccharalis were exposed to a meridic diet treated with selected concentrations of Cry1Ab protein. Larval mortality was measured at 7 days after inoculation. Statistically significant differences in median lethal concentrations (LC50S) were detected among insect populations from different geographical locations, but the field populations remained as susceptible as a laboratory strain of D. saccharalis that had been maintained in the laboratory for > 20 years without exposure to any chemical insecticides or Bt toxins. The LC(50)s of Cry1Ab protein, which was extracted from DKC69-70 Bt corn hybrid, ranged from 0.03 to 0.32 mu g/g for the seven field populations collected during 2004. The LC50 values based on bioassays with purified, trypsin-activated Cry1Ab protein from a recombinant Escherichia coli culture were 0.03-0.17 mu g/g for the 11ield populations collected during 2005-2006. Small changes in Cry1Ab susceptibility were detected among crops, years of sampling, or locations. All field-collected insect populations, except one, exhibited lower LC50 values than the laboratory strain. The results of this study suggest that field populations of D. saccharalis remain generally susceptible to the Cry1Ab protein after 8 years use of transgenic Bt corn in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast area of Texas.

Modeling the Impact of Cross-pollination and Low Toxin Expression in Corn Kernels on Adaptation of European Corn Borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) to Transgenic Insecticidal Corn	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bt corn; resistance management; simulation	OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS LEPIDOPTERA; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT; SEED MIXTURES; NON-BT; PYRALIDAE; DYNAMICS; SURVIVAL; BEHAVIOR; CONTAMINATION	We used a mathematical model with processes reflecting larval mortality resulting from feeding on cross-pollinated ears or Bt ears of corn to analyze the risk of evolution of Cry-toxin resistance in Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner). In the simulations, evolution of resistance was delayed equally well by both seed mixtures and blocks with the same proportion of refuge. Our results showed that Bt-pollen drift has little impact on the evolution of Bt resistance in O. nubilalis. However, low-toxin expression in ears of transgenic corn can reduce the durability of transgenic corn expressing single toxin, whereas durability of pyramided corn hybrids is not significantly reduced. The toxin-survival rate of heterozygous larvae in Bt-corn ears expressing one or two proteins has more impact on evolution of Bt resistance in O. nubilalis than the parameters related to larval movement to Bt ears or the toxin-survival rate of the homozygous susceptible larvae in Bt ears. Bt resistance evolves slower when toxin mortality is distributed across the first two larval stadia than when only the first instars are susceptible to Bt toxins. We suggest that stakeholders examine toxin-survival rates for insect pests and take into account that instars may feed on different parts of Bt corn.

J	Milwright, RDP				Milwright, RDP			Breeding biology of the Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus in the fenland basin of eastern Britain	BIRD STUDY			English	Article								This paper describes, for the first time, aspects of the breeding biology of the British Golden Oriole population. The Golden Oriole population in the fenland basin of East Anglia became established in 1967 and since the early 1980s the annual breeding population has varied from about 20 to 35 pairs. Males arrived in mid-Mac, and females about a week later Nest building starts about five days after female arrival. Mean date for first egg laying was around I June. The mean clutch size was 3.53. Observed incubation periods were 18 to 19 days. Mean hatching date was 18 June, and the mean brood size at seven days was 2.60. Nestling periods were from 13 to 15 days, and the mean fledging date was 3 July. Failed clutches may be replaced; no evidence was found for genuine second broods. Estimated mean productivity of all nests including failures was 1.4-2.0 fledgings per nest. The greatest cause of failure was bad weather in June, and nests produced three times as many fledged young in warm dry Junes as in cool wet ones. The breeding habitat is very strongly associated with plantations of early leafing hybrid Black Poplars Populus nigra. A total of 94.2% of all nests found were in these trees, and since 1987 this figure has risen to 100%. The mean height of the nests in poplars was about 7 m below the top of the tree, irrespective of the height of the tree. Most nests were in the north, northeast or east sectors of the tree, and 80% were within two trees of the edge of the woodland. Breeding densities were generally at or below 0.25 pairs/km(2), but up to 2.25 pairs/km(2). Nestling diet contains many Poplar-feeding Lepidoptera and a surprising number of Bumblebees. Conservation efforts should aim to produce more areas of Poplar woodland with plenty of woodland edges and with 30 ha/km(2) of Poplar plantation.

Results of normal and inverse cluster analyses of plot samples of the full range of indigenous vegetation remaining in each District are presented. Up to 17 plant communities from each District are characterised in terms of physiognomy, flora, and physiography. These range from beech forests and lowland red tussock grassland through upland shrublands, shrub-tussocklands, tussocklands, sedgelands, and wetlands to high-alpine communities (snowbank, cushionfield, scree). The 649 indigenous and 97 adventive vascular plant taxa plus 21 hybrids are listed by District. Plant distributions, particularly altitudinal and geographic limits for many alpine and some threatened taxa, are described. Of the region's fauna, 61 birds, 268 Lepidoptera, 202 Coleoptera (some in both orders undescribed), and several other invertebrates including the rare land snail Powelliphanta spedeni spedeni are listed by District. Distributions of several rare andi or local taxa are described both within and beyond the Region. Aquatic fauna of unmodified upland lakes and ponds of Umbrella District are recorded. Within the Region, 31 areas ranging from 25 ha to 2620 ha are recommended for protection, 20 (6260 ha or 2.4%) from the Umbrella District and 11 (11 615 ha or 9.5%) from the Nokomai District. These were selected so as to adequately represent the full range of remaining indigenous ecosystems and their associated landforms. Details of progress (to July 1997) with the implementation phase of the programme are outlined. Of the 31 Recommended Areas for Protection (RAPs) identified in the field surveys, seven now have some degree of protection over their full extent and nine are partly protected. These protected areas represent 44% (c. 7985 ha) of the total area of the 31 RAPs (18 060 ha) identified. Tenure review of pastoral leasehold land continues to be an important means of protecting conservation values in these two Districts, as in other parts of the South Island high country.

GLYPHOSATE TOLERANT VOLUNTEER CORN CONTROL AT TWO DEVELOPMENT STAGES	PLANTA DANINHA			English	Article						enetically modified; in tank mixture; ACCase inhibitors; auxin inhibitors; antagonism; rampant weed	INTERFERENCE	The loss of grains during the harvest of glyphosate tolerant corn may generate volunteer plants, which can interfere in the conventional or glyphosate crop in succession. The current work aim to evaluate the control of the volunteer corn glyphosate tolerant under two weed stages. Aimed to evaluate the control of volunteer glyphosate tolerant corn in two stages of development. There were conducted two experiments with hybrid 2B688 HR (lepidoptera and glyphosate tolerant), the application were at V-5 and V-8 stage. The experiment was randomized block design with four replicates, using the treatments: haloxyfop at 25, 50 and 62 g ha(-1) alone and associated with 2,4-D at 670 g ha(-1) or fluroxypyr at 200 g ha(-1). The standard was clethodim at 84 g ha(-1) with 2,4-D and fluroxypyr at same rates. The applications of haloxyfop and clethodim both isolated or in a mixture with 2,4-D and fluroxypyr at V5 stage showed total control (100%) at 32 and 39 days after the application, except for haloxyfop + 2,4-D (25 + 670 g ha(-1)) mixture, which did not provided adequate control. At V8 stage, haloxyfop + 2,4-D (50 + 670 g ha(-1)) and haloxyfop + 2,4-D (62 + 670 g ha(-1)) mixtures took up to 6 and 10 days or longer to reach adequate to excellent control, when compared to haloxyfop isolated applications in the same doses, respectively. Either isolated clethodim or mixed with 2, 4-D and fluroxypyr did not show adequate control. The treatments showed efficient control on volunteer corn plants at V-5 stage, except for haloxyfop + 2, 4-D (25 + 670 g ha(-1)) mixture. At V-8 stage applications, haloxyfop either isolated or mixture with fluroxypyr demonstrated excellent control on every evaluated dose. The mixture with 2, 4-D can reduce haloxyfop efficiency at low doses. Clethodim alone or mixed with 2,4-D or furoxypyr did not provide acceptable level of control.	[Costa, N., V; Scariot, C.

J	Raksrithong, P; Locharoenrat, K				Raksrithong, Pawin; Locharoenrat, Kitsakorn			Absorption spectra and electric field distributions of butterfly wing scale models coated with a metal film studied by finite-difference time-domain method	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article								Inspired by alternative hybrid-biophotonic structures and modern computational electromagnetics in plasmonics, herein, we attempted to understand the plasmonic properties of a metal film (gold or palladium) on the surface features of butterfly wing scales, as they might represent the dominant features of structure-enhanced and/or structure-attenuated optical properties. Light-harvesting plasmonic antenna was loaded on these natural substrates. We examined the plasmonic properties of three models representing the scales of three lepidoptera species. Each scale model was assumed to have a 100 nm metal coating. In addition to the electron micrograph of the lepidopterans' wings, the optical properties of the investigated structures were numerically studied using the finite-difference time-domain technique. We first constructed the biophotonic models of butterfly structures coated with a metal film, and then they were verified by scanning electron microscopy images using Lumerical Software, which provided an accurate solution of Maxwell's equation for the micro/nanostructures. The metal samples were palladium or gold, while the investigated scales of butterfly species were Catopsilia pomona, Danaus genutia, and Cetbosia pentbesilea. Electric field and absorption spectra were observed under broadband light irradiations at perpendicular- and parallel-polarized light illuminations. As a result of the formation of variations of metals on the different features of wing scales, we observed changes in the absorption intensities and a redshift in the main peak absorbance. The spectra further showed a close relationship with the electric field distribution. A metal film coated on the butterfly wing scales acted as an optical plasmonic sensitivity to amplify and attenuate the visible light, whereas the existence of wave propagating modes from the well-defined structural variations resulted in a reduction and enhancement of the bandwidth of absorbance. Among the three simulation models, the Cetbosia pentbesilea scale model coated with a gold film demonstrated the best plasmonic properties to the electric field, in terms of its potential application for further biophotonic structure fabrication.

Susceptibility of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin Cry2Ab before and after the introduction of Bollgard-II	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Helicoverpa armigera; Bt cotton; Bacillus thuringiensis; Resistance; Cry2Ab	INSECTICIDAL PROTEIN; DELTA-ENDOTOXINS; CRY1AC; RESISTANCE; TOXICITY; KURSTAKI; SPECIFICITY; EXPRESSION; SURVIVAL; EFFICACY	The geographical variability in Helicoverpa armigera susceptibility levels to Cry2Ab toxin expressed by transgenic maize (not currently commercialized in India) was determined through log dose probit assays conducted on populations collected during 2004-05 (from 25 districts) and 2007-08 (from 22 districts) across India. While 2004-05 is the year prior to commercialization of dual gene Bollgard-II-Bt cotton that expresses Cry2Ab in addition to Cry1Ac, 2007-08 is two years after its commercial release. LC50 values ranged from 6.0 to 28.6 mu g Cry2Ab/ml of diet in 2004-05 and from 2.46 to 34.7 mu g Cry2Ab/ml of diet in 2007-08. The IC50 range in 2004-05 and 2007-08 was from 0.31 to 2.3 mu g/ml and 0.10-3.4 mu g/ml of diet, respectively. The probit analysis data of 2004-05 can be used as baseline indices to monitor for changes in the H. armigera susceptibility to Cry2Ab, subsequent to the introduction of Bollgard-II cotton in India. The probit analysis data of 2007-08 showed that the baseline has not undergone any significant changes two years after cultivation of Bollgard-II in India. The relatively low toxicity of Cry2Ab and its higher expression late in the cotton season compared with Cry2Ab, compounded with its presence in Bt hybrids on a separate linkage group from Cry1Ac suggest problems of resistance in the future.

Within-population allozyme variability is consistently high, and local effective population sizes are inferred to be in the thousands of individuals. The pairwise analysis yields an average neighbourhood area of radius 3.5 km. Among populations within most regions, differentiation is low and M > 2 effective individuals population(-1) generation(-1). Pairwise comparisons within the britannica group show a disjunction indicating that it is out of equilibrium, perhaps as a result of secondary contact between highland and lowland groups. Comparison between meridionalis groups on mainland Italy and Corsica yields M > 12; this is surely too high and lack of equilibrium resulting from initial colonization is suspected. The hierarchical analysis indicates that 23 less than or equal to M less than or equal to 88 among the taxa napi, bryoniae and meridionalis that meet in hybrid zones; no effective gene flow barrier exists among them. This high estimate could also result from recent primary contact, but such a genetic barrier should produce the 'edge effects' seen in population genetic simulations, and no evidence of this was found among geographically close samples of napi and bryoniae populations from Switzerland. Studies of gene flow among geographic regions are greatly limited by the equilibrium assumption, though studies of local differentiation are much less so. Population studies of gene flow on local scales at regional boundaries provide limited means of testing the equilibrium assumption, and both regional and local analyses provide testable predictions about local population structure. When the equilibrium assumption is not upheld, local patterns at regional boundaries can provide historical information about primary vs. secondary contact.

However, FAW presents a high capacity to develop resistance to Bt protein-expressing crop lines, as reported in Brazil, Argentina, Puerto Rico and the southeastern U.S. Here, FAW genotypes resistant to pyramided maize events expressing Cry1F/Cry1A.105/Cry2Ab2 (P-R genotype) and Cry1A.105/Cry2Ab2 (Y-R genotype) from Brazil were used to investigate the interactions between non-Bt hosts (non-Bt maize, non-Bt cotton, millet and sorghum) and fitness costs. We also tested a FAW genotype susceptible to Bt maize and F-1 hybrids of the resistant and susceptible genotypes (heterozygotes). Recessive fitness costs (i.e., costs affecting the resistant insects) were observed for pupal and neonate to adult survival of the P-R genotype on non-Bt cotton; larval developmental time of the P-R genotype on millet and sorghum; larval and neonate-to-adult developmental time of the Y-R genotype on non-Bt cotton and sorghum; the fecundity of the Y-R genotype on non-Bt cotton; and mean generation time of both resistant genotypes. However, on non-Bt cotton and non-Bt maize, the P-R genotype had a higher fitness (i.e., fitness benefits), displaying greater fecundity and rates of population increases than the Sus genotype. Non-recessive fitness costs (i.e., costs affecting heterozygotes) were found for fecundity and population increases on millet and sorghum. These findings suggest that, regardless of the disadvantages of the resistant genotypes in some hosts, the resistance of FAW to Cry1 and Cry2 Bt proteins is not linked with substantial fitness costs, and may persist in field conditions once present.

The fertile female progeny can be backcrossed with H. virescens males to produce more sterile male and fertile female offspring. Successive generations of backcross female progeny continue to produce sterile male and fertile female offspring when backcrossed to H. virescens males. Backcross sterile males readily mate with wild-type H. virescens females under field conditions. Backcross male sterility is of interest for its potential to suppress populations of the pest moth Heliothis virescens. Rickettsia-like organisms have been observed in the testes of backcross sterile males and the two parental species of Heliothis. Prokaryotic endosymbionts have been associated with hybrid sterility in other insects. Therefore, we investigated Heliothis endosymbionts via an analysis of their PCR-amplified rRNA genes (rDNA). Prokaryotic-specific primers were used to amplify 16S rDNA from aseptically removed testes. PCR reactions without testes extract were negative. Endosymbionts from H. virescens and H.subflexa were genetically different. The size of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA indicates that endosymbionts in backcross sterile males originate from H. subflexa. Sterile males have essentially a H. virescens nuclear genome as a result of backcrossing. We propose that backcross male sterility results from an incompatibility between the maternally inherited endosymbiont type found in the cytoplasm and the predominantly paternal genetic material found in the nucleus.

Hedgerow barriers and other reduced-risk controls for managing Oriental fruit moth, Grapholitha molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae) in apples	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						grapholitha molesta; flight behavior; IPM; live hedgerows; reduced-risk insecticides	OBLIQUEBANDED LEAFROLLER LEPIDOPTERA; CODLING MOTH; ARTHROPOD PESTS; ORCHARDS; INSECTICIDES; RESISTANCE; HOMOPTERA; CICADELLIDAE; PERFORMANCE; MICHIGAN	Management of Oriental fruit moth, Grapholitha molesta (Busck), in apple using an 'Enhanced Integrated Pest Management (IPM)' program comprised of a hedgerow barrier, pheromone-based mating disruption and reduced-risk [non-organophosphorous (OP) or carbamate] insecticides was investigated over a 5-year period. The barrier was comprised of a planting of three rows of hybrid poplar, Populus deltoides Bartr. x Populus nigra L., one row of Italian alder, Alnus cordata L. (nectar reward), and one row of white pine, Pinus strobus L. The hedgerow completely surrounded the perimeter of the apple orchard and was treated with garlic and a low rate of pyrethroid insecticide in 4 of the 5 years. The Enhanced IPM program significantly reduced G. molesta populations as measured by moth captures in pheromone traps. Captures of G. molesta were significantly higher in apple orchards treated with OP and carbamate insecticides, 'Conventional IPM', and either not surrounded by the hedgerow or with the barrier present but not treated with the repellent compounds. To explain these differences in G. molesta control, and the potential non-lethal effect of hedgerow barriers on G. molesta orchard colonization, we studied the adult vertical movement in a traditional unsprayed standard apple orchard at three different heights: 0.95, 1.95 and 3.20 m, respectively. In the overwintering generation at a height of 0.95 and 1.95 m, the mean number of moths captured per sampling period was 14.64 and 14.84, respectively, and only 2.95 at 3.20 m. However, the number of individuals captured in the second and third generations was not significantly different at the three different heights. Fruit damage evaluated before 'June drop' closely corresponded to the distribution of moths captured during the overwintering generation. Fruit damage at a height of 1.95 and 3.20m was 5.8 and 3.5%, respectively. These results indicated that G. molesta is a weak flyer and that hedgerow barriers exerted some influence in the colonization of the orchard by limiting the free movement of adults from the overwintering generation. Thus, hedgerow barriers seem to limit early migration and establishment of G. molesta in the orchard. This in turn may reduce the size of the following generations and makes subsequent control easier under the Enhanced IPM program.

The dose-mortality regression lines of the F, hybrid of susceptible females and resistant males (SR) and resistant females and susceptible males (RS) were roughly intermediate between those of parental lines, i.e., SS and RR. This result indicates that the mode of inheritance of fenvalerate resistance was neither complete dominance nor recessive, with no sex-linkage. The egg size of RR lines was significantly smaller than that of the SS lines. The RS and SR lines have an egg size close to that of their own matrilineage. We considered that the mode of inheritance of resistance and that of egg size were different from each other, although the selection experiment showed that there is a negatively correlated response between these parameters. The survival rate of the RR lines was significantly lower than that of the SS lines. However, the survival rate of the RS lines did not differ from that of the SR lines. Reproductive fitness is discussed with regard to different egg sizes among parental lines and reciprocal crosses.

Intercropped Bt and non-Bt corn with ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis) as a tool to resistance management of Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Brachiaria ruziziensis; fall armyworm; resistance; alternative host; Santa F&#233; system; Vip3Aa20		BACKGROUND Corn intercropped with ruzigrass is common in Brazil, and it can improve the physicochemical features of soils, increase water retention, and suppress the emergence of resistant weeds and soil nematodes. As both corn and ruzigrass are hosts to Spodoptera frugiperda (the main corn pest in South America), the cultivation of both these plants in the same place at one time motivates investigation into the pest population dynamics. We hypothesize that the intercropping system influences S. frugiperda pressure and leaf injury in corn. Considering that if corn hybrids with high dose toxin expression are used, ruzigrass may be a potential host to susceptible S. frugiperda larvae, consequently an alternative refuge and be included as a tool for the resistant management of Bt corn. To test these hypotheses about the use of ruzigrass as an alternative host of S. frugiperda in an intercropping system with corn, we conducted field trials in three seasons to verify S. frugiperda population dynamics and leaf injury to crop systems. In addition to phenotypic evaluation, we also characterized molecularly S. frugiperda strains collected in corn and ruzigrass to identify strain differences. RESULTS The insects collected in both corn and ruzigrass were identified as corn strains. Ruzigrass was used as a S. frugiperda host during all crop cycles. The intercropped system did not increase the S. frugiperda population or leaf injury on Bt corn. CONCLUSION The results suggest that the intercropped system is not prejudicial to Bt corn cultivation since high dose concept applies to all larvae instars. The results also suggest that ruzigrass may be used as a promising alternative refuge in Bt corn agroecosystems, if compliance with management strategies is followed.
