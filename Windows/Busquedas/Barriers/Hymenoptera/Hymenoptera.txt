J	Boato, A; Battisti, A				Boato, A; Battisti, A			High genetic variability despite haplodiploidy in primitive sawflies of the genus Cephalcia (Hymenoptera, Pamphiliidae)	EXPERIENTIA			English	Article						Hymenoptera; Symphyta; haplodiploidy; heterozygosity; allozymes	POPULATION-GENETICS; HETEROZYGOSITY; SELECTION; INSECTS; NEODIPRION; DIVERSITY; DISTANCE; NUMBER	Hymenoptera are haplodiploid and usually display very low genetic variation. Most data concern social or parasitic Apocrita, while the little information available for the primitive phytophagous species of the suborder Symphyta is contradictory. The present study is related tea seven species of the genus Cephalcia, living in coniferous forests of Northern Eurasia and sharing spruce (Picea sp. pi.) as host plant. individuals from 22 populations belonging to Cephalcia abietis, C. alashanica, C. arvensis, C. erythrogaster, C. fallenii, C. fulva, C. klugii from Europe and China were surveyed for genetic variation at 28 loci using enzyme electrophoresis. Pairs of sibling species were recognized within C. arvensis and C. fallenii, corresponding to different phenological and morphological forms. In the latter case, reproductive isolation in sympatry occurs despite low genetic distance (D = 0.059). Large genetic distances and fixed alternate alleles were observed between Chinese and European populations of C. abietis and C. arvensis. Expected heterozygosity of Cephalcia populations (0.197, SD 0.064) is significantly higher than that of other Symphyta (Tenthredinoidea) (average H-exp 0.059, SD 0.032) (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, Z = 4.39, p <0.01). These data suggest that haplodiploidy per se does not reduce the genetic variation in most Cephalcia populations. Most of the factors that can lower the potential for genetic diversity in a haplodiploid genetic system are not so effective in Cephalcia populations, which seem to be comparable to diplodiploid insect populations in diversity. In a few isolated populations the large number of fixed loci and the large genetic distances may support the predicted faster rate of fixation, as a consequence of haplodiploidy.

Despite their high species numbers and specific biology, there are only few studies on speciation in Hymenoptera. This study aims to identify very early reproductive barriers in a local, sympatric population of Nasonia vitripennis (Walker 1836), a hymenopterous parasitoid of fly pupae. We studied ecological barriers, sexual barriers, and the reduction in F1-female offspring as a postmating barrier, as well as the population structure using microsatellites. Results We found considerable inbreeding within female strains and a population structure with either three or five subpopulation clusters defined by microsatellites. In addition, there are two ecotypes, one parasitizing fly pupae in bird nests and the other on carrion. The nest ecotype is mainly formed from one of the microsatellite clusters, the two or four remaining microsatellite clusters form the carrion ecotype. There was slight sexual isolation and a reduction in F1-female offspring between inbreeding strains from the same microsatellite clusters and the same ecotypes. Strains from different microsatellite clusters are separated by a reduction in F1-female offspring. Ecotypes are separated only by ecological barriers. Conclusions This is the first demonstration of very early reproductive barriers within a sympatric population of Hymenoptera. It demonstrates that sexual and premating barriers can precede ecological separation. This indicates the complexity of ecotype formation and highlights the general need for more studies within homogenous populations for the identification of the earliest barriers in the speciation process.

We review what is known of their sex pheromone chemistry and function, paying particular emphasis to the Hymenoptera Aculeata (primarily ants, bees, and sphecid and vespid wasps), and provide a framework for the functional classification of their sex pheromones. Sex pheromones often comprise multicomponent blends derived from numerous exocrine tissues, including the cuticle. However, very few sex pheromones have been definitively characterized using bioassays, in part because of the behavioral sophistication of many Aculeata. The relative importance of species isolation versus sexual selection in shaping sex pheromone evolution is still unclear. Many species appear to discriminate among mates at the level of individual or kin/colony, and they use antiaphrodisiacs. Some orchids use hymenopteran sex pheromones to dupe males into performing pseudocopulation, with extreme species specificity.

Understanding how they overcome these obstacles is crucial for the development of effective risk assessment and regulation. Reproductive biology is known to influence establishment capacity in plants and is widely used for risk assessment. This biological field should receive more attention, and particularly in the case of insects, as they display a wide range of reproductive traits and have a great impact on the economy and environment. Among insects, the order Hymenoptera is of interest for its diversity, both in terms of reproductive traits and introduction history, as invasive species and biological control agents. We review the main reproductive strategies of Hymenoptera, spanning parthenogenesis, sex determination, reproductive parasites and mating strategies, and evaluate their effect on invasive potential. For instance, thelytoky could decrease the strength of Allee effects while Arrhenotoky could increase adaptive potential. A species with complementary sex determination could be more affected by inbreeding than other species, while paternal genome elimination could lead to high levels of homozygosity. Finally, some reproductive behaviours could decrease inbreeding, facilitate mate location or adaptation by encouraging admixture. The two invasive speciesApis mellifera scutellataandLeptocybe invasaand the biocontrol agentAphidius erviserve as case studies to illustrate the effect of reproductive traits on species capacities to become established in a new area.

Immigrant inviability promotes reproductive isolation among host-associated populations of the gall wasp Belonocnema treatae	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						ecological speciation; hypersensitive response; local adaptation; barriers to gene flow; Quercus; Hymenoptera; Cynipidae; Fagaceae	PROGRAMMED CELL-DEATH; NATURAL-SELECTION; GENE FLOW; INSECTS; HYPERSENSITIVITY; HYMENOPTERA; RESISTANCE; PLANTS	Ecological speciation describes the evolutionary process whereby divergent natural selection between environments generates reproductive isolation. Studying the magnitude of sequential reproductive barriers between ecologically divergent populations improves our understanding of the way these barriers evolve and how each contributes to the speciation process. Immigrant inviability describes the lower fitness of immigrants in non-native environments and is an important, but long underexplored, reproductive barrier. In this study, we test the role of immigrant inviability among host-associated populations of the gall wasp Belonocnema treataeMayr (Hymenoptera: Cynipini: Cynipidae) by measuring the ability of gall wasps to initiate and complete gall formation, while avoiding host immune responses, on closely related native and non-native live oaks, Quercus virginianaMill., Quercus fusiformisSmall, and Quercus geminataSmall (Fagaceae). In general, we found evidence for immigrant inviability when B.treatae populations colonized non-native host species. However, patterns were variable among years, suggesting that episodic events may play an important role in connecting ecologically divergent populations.

It is known from parasitoid wasps in the genera Nasonia and Trichogramma (Hymenoptera). In these haplodiploids, the egg fertilized by sperm carrying PSR matures as a haploid male that again carries, and is capable of transmitting, the PSR chromosome. Because of its unique transmission behavior, the PSR chromosome may be easily transmitted between species. This study tests whether the interspecific transmission of PSR between Trichogramma kaykai Pinto and Stouthamer and Trichogramma deion Pinto and Oatman (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is affected by two types of postzygotic reproductive isolation, i.e., hybrid inviability and hybrid sterility. The results show that PSR can rescue fertilized eggs that would normally be inviable in the interspecific cross and the rescued eggs develop into male offspring that carry PSR. The results suggest that the two types of postzygotic reproductive isolation have no effect on the transmission of PSR between the two Trichogramma species.

Diversity, Host Ranges, and Potential Drivers of Speciation Among the Inquiline Enemies of Oak Gall Wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae)	INSECT SYSTEMATICS AND DIVERSITY			English	Article						Synergus; Cynipidae; ecological speciation; Quercus; gall-forming insects	ANDRICUS-QUERCUSCALICIS HYMENOPTERA; RACE FORMATION; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; DNA BARCODES; PARASITOIDS; POPULATION; INSECTS; HISTORY	Animals that exploit living spaces of other animals (inquilines) may have specialized traits that adapt them to extended phenotypes of their 'hosts'. These adaptations to host traits may incur fitness trade-offs that restrict the host range of an inquiline such that shifts to new hosts might trigger inquiline diversification. Speciation via host shifting has been studied in many animal parasites, but we know less about the role of host shifts in inquiline speciation. Synergus Hartig (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Synergini) is a speciose but taxonomically challenging genus of inquilines that feed inside galls induced by oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Cynipini). Here, we report on a large collection of Synergus reared from galls of 33 oak gall wasp species in the upper Midwestern United States. We integrated DNA barcodes, morphology, ecology, and phenology to delimit putative species of Synergus and describe their host ranges. We find evidence of at least 23 Synergus species associated with the 33 gall wasp hosts. At least five previously described Synergus species are each complexes of two to five species, while three species fit no prior description. We find evidence that oak tree phylogeny and host gall morphology define axes of specialization for Synergus. The North American Synergus have experienced several transitions among gall hosts and tree habitats and their host use is correlated with reproductive isolation. It remains too early to tell whether shifts to new hosts initiate speciation events in Synergus inquilines of oak gall wasps, or if host shifts occur after reproductive isolation has already evolved.

Geometric morphometrics is a useful tool to detect minimal morphological variations, which often are undetectable by traditional morphological studies and even by classical morphometric approaches. We applied geometric morphometrics to wing venation to assess a complex case of sibling species in the genus Eubazus (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), parasitoids of conifer bark weevils of the genus Pissodes (Coleoptera, Curculionidae). The results and methods were compared with previous taxonomic studies on the same species, involving classical multivariate morphometrics, isoenzyme analyses, cross-mating experiments and biological observations. Geometric morphometrics confirmed the previous division into four distinct species. However, this approach enabled the four species to be separated simultaneously, with a reliability of 98.6% for well-classified females and 93.1% for males. A similar result in previous studies was obtained only by combining isoenzyme analyses and several canonical variate analyses, including many morphometric characters. Furthermore, measurements of wing venation were less time-consuming, more reliable and required less prior knowledge of braconid taxonomy than the measurements needed for the classical morphometrics methods. Geometric morphometrics was used also to test the effect of host species on wing shape. Several female populations of Eubazus semirugosus originating from three different Pissodes spp. were compared. Significant differences were found in wing shape between conspecific Eubazus from different host species. The results are discussed in relation to reproductive isolation and genetic flow between the four species.

This study aims to clarify genetic differentiation of G. brasiliensis based on the nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene and three nuclear DNA regions, the inter-transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) and putative 60S ribosomal protein L37 (RpL37), as well as crossing experiments. Four lineages are recognized in individuals assigned as G. basiliensis by morphology, (1) individuals occurring in Japan and probably South Korea, (2) individuals from a small subtropical island of Japan, Iriomote-jima, (3) individuals from temperate lowlands of Japan and high altitude areas of Southeast Asia, and (4) individuals occurring widely in Asia, America, Hawaii and Africa. The first lineage is a specialist of Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), a pest of fresh fruit, and also the fourth lineage has a capacity to parasitize this pest species. The first, third and fourth lineages occur sympatrically at least in Tokyo. The third and fourth lineages differed in mate choice and host use to some extent, but post-mating isolation between them was almost absent.

Cotesia, vestalis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) has been widely used in many parts of the world as a major biocontrol agent, of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The rate of parasitism and the rate of control exerted on the pests are highly variable geographically as well as not. all introduction and augmentations were successful. Populations from different geographic regions often display various Levels of reproductive incompatibility because they have been geographically isolated, experienced different selection pressures and/or adapted to various local environments. Experiment were conducted to compare reproductive compatibility between two geographic populations of C. vestalis one from Fukuoka, Japan (Temperate population) and the other from Mandalay, Myanmar (Tropical population). Results indicated that there was partial incompatibility between the two populations.

Ovule-gall stimulating a large fake fruit on Miconia chamissois Naudin (Melastomataceae): a structural overview	BOTANY			English	Article						Allorhogas uberlandiensis; Hymenoptera; histochemistry; nutritive tissue	HYMENOPTERA-BRACONIDAE DORYCTINAE; PHYTOPHAGOUS BRACONID; INSECTS; CELLS	The developmental processes of galls are better known when they are induced on vegetative organs, whereas they have hardly ever been described for reproductive ones. Herein, galls induced by Allorhogas uberlandiensis (Hymenoptera) on ovules of Miconia chamissois Naudin (Melastomataceae) were analyzed in terms of morphological, anatomical, histochemical, and cytological characteristics. Galls are induced on the ovules before fertilization, and act as a physiological seed. Therefore, the ovary grows and develops into a fruit-like gall. The ovule-galls are on average 20-times larger than the seeds, and fruit-like gall volume is on average 5.4-times greater than that of mature fruits. These are related to cell hypertrophy and tissue hyperplasia in the host organ. There is a typical nutritive-tissue formation in the ovule-gall with lipid, protein, and pectin storage, as well as a storage tissue close to the epidermis. This nutritive tissue shows a smooth endoplasmic reticulum, multivesicular bodies, and mitochondria-rich cells. After gall induction, all of the ovules degenerate, and the ovary and hypanthium hypertrophy to form the fruit-like gall. The fruit-like galls form a physical barrier blocking the anthesis, thereby preventing fertilization and keeping only ovule-galls. Our study shows that the galling insect A. uberlandensis may reduce the reproductive success of M. chamissois, thus acting as a biological control agent for this host-plant population.

Here we describe the courtship behavior of two sibling species (N. longicornis and N. giraulti) and compare their courtship to that of N. vitripennis. Courtship behavior of Nasonia males includes mounting of females, orientation to the female's head, and a repeated series of stereotypic movements, including head nods, mouthpart extrusions, antennal sweeps, and wing vibrations. Females signal receptivity by lowering their antennae in synchrony with opening their genital orifice. After copulation, males engage in brief postcopulatory displays. All three species have the basic components described above. However, although the three species are quite similar morphologically, there are distinct differences in courtship displays. Notable differences include the length of courtship cycles, the absence of a ritualized antennal sweep prior to the first cycle in vitripennis, additional head nods and ritualized foreleg movements in longicornis, and a dramatic increase in numbers of head nods in giraulti. Results show that closely related species cart often be distinguished based on courtship differences, although many of these differences may not contribute to a reproductive barrier.

In the 1970s, a parasitoid identified as B. hebetor was released for control of Heliothis/Helicoverpa spp. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on the island of Barbados. Because life-history traits of this parasitoid differed from those reported for B. hebetor from the United States, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to determine whether this parasitoid was (i) a population of B. hebetor that attacks noctuids in the held or (ii) a different species from B. hebetor. We confirmed that Heliothis virescens (F.) was a more suitable host for the Barbados strain than for B. hebetor. However, a stored-grain infesting pyralid, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), was a more suitable host for the Barbados strain than was H. virescens. Reciprocal crosses between the Barbados strain and B. hebetor showed that the two populations were reproductively isolated. No mating was observed during a series of 30-min observations of reciprocal crosses, and the crosses produced only male offspring. Examination of each female's spermatheca confirmed that females were not fertilized, Sequence analysis of a 517-bp fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene revealed that two populations of B. hebetor from our laboratory were identical but differed in sequence by 2% from the Barbados strain. Collectively, our results indicate that the Barbados strain is a distinct species from B. hebetor. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

Using morphological characters, host records, museum specimens, flight propensity and phylogenetic analysis of published cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear SNP data, we resolve the long-standing taxonomic confusion within Belonocnema and recognize three distinct species that are distributed throughout the southern and south-eastern USA: B. fossoria (rev. stat.), B. kinseyi (rev. stat.) and B. treatae, while B. quercusvirens is treated as species inquirenda. The presence of mitonuclear discordance results in the failure of a mitochondrial DNA barcode region to distinguish between B. fossoria and B. treatae, while recognizing B. kinseyi, despite the three species being clearly separated based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis of SNP data. We provide re-descriptions and an updated dichotomous key for both asexual and sexual generations of these widespread species. Finally, as Belonocnema has emerged as a model organism for ecological and evolutionary studies, we clarify the species examined in published studies to date.	[Zhang, Y.

In the British Isles, there are 37 recorded species, all of which feed on grasses as larvae and are largely host specific. Some form galls on their hosts; others do not. We used a range of enzyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to investigate a complex of five cryptic species occurring sympatrically in the UK, collected from seven sites in mainland England and Wales: T calamagrostidis (von Schlechtendal), T longicornis (Walker) and T petiolata (Walker) infesting different grass hosts, and T hyalipennis (Walker) s.l. comprising two-host adapted forms (labelled 1 and 2) reared from the grasses Elymus repens and E. farctus, respectively. Nine soluble enzyme systems (some known to be polymorphic in other insects) and 37 RAPD primers allowed taxonomic separation of the species. However, whilst RAPD markers were able to discriminate between the two host-adapted forms of T hyalipennis, enzyme markers (producing phenotypic profiles in the absence of genetic crosses) could not. Upon calculating genetic distances for the RAPD data from which a cladogram of Euclidean distances (relatedness) was produced along with multivariate analysis of the data, T longicornis was shown to be the most 'basal' species, and most related to T hyalipennis s.l.; T. calamagrostidis and T petiolata were found to be more distantly related to these species but most closely related to each other. The two forms of T hyalipennis s.l. appear to be the most closely related of any of the species investigated, probably diverging the most recently. From this data, and since the populations examined were all sympatric without obvious physical barriers to reproduction, it can be concluded that some degree of sympatric evolution has occurred, most obviously in the case of the host-adapted forms of T hyalipennis. If so, this complex of species could be another rare example of sympatric speciation in insects. Further research using more sophisticated molecular markers such as microsatellites, amplified fragment length polymorphic markers (AFLPs) and DNA sequencing (e.g. of mtDNA and ribosomal DNA regions), in conjunction with behavioural studies, are required to further elucidate this interesting species group.

Introduction of genetic variation by admixing different populations may increase the fitness of populations, minimizing the negative effects of rearing many generations in artificial conditions. We experimentally investigated the role of intraspecific hybridization in enhancing the fitness of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma galloi Zucchi, 1988 (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), by reciprocally crossing three populations. Our results showed that the mating type did not affect the number of crosses that produced viable daughters. Homotypic crosses produced 94% viable daughters, while heterotypic crosses produced 92%. There were neither mating incompatibilities nor reproductive barriers between these populations. However, we observed a low fitness value for females from one of the populations studied. The fitness of hybrids was either unchanged or improved (in one case) when compared to the parental populations. We discuss the implications of our results and suggest future research directions.

Development of microsatellite markers for an outbreaking species of oak gall wasp, Zapatella davisae (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), in the northeastern United States	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						next-generation sequencing; ion torrent; population genetics; reproductive mode; parthenogenesis	GALLWASPS HYMENOPTERA; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; PUJADE-VILLAR; GENUS; PARASITOIDS; POPULATION; MELIKA; SOFTWARE; PROGRAM; TANG	Populations of the recently described black oak gall wasp, Zapatella davisae Buffington (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), have been identified as the cause of extensive tree damage and mortality to black oaks, Quercus velutina Lamarck (Fagales: Fagaceae), in the northeastern United States. Relatively little is known, however, about the distribution, phylogenetic placement, and lifecycle of this important tree pest. Therefore, we conducted next-generation sequencing using the Ion Torrent (TM) PGM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.) platform to develop genomic resources for the study of Z. davisae and for other closely related species of oak gall wasps. Individual sequence reads were aligned, assembled into unique contigs, and the contigs were then utilized for the in silico isolation and development of microsatellite markers. In total, we screened 36 candidate microsatellite loci, of which 23 amplified consistently (five polymorphic and 18 monomorphic). We then examined whether the polymorphic loci could be used to infer whether populations of Z. davisae from Cape Cod and Nantucket are sexual or asexual by calculating several metrics of genetic diversity that might indicate the mode of reproduction. These included testing for statistical deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and for linkage disequilibrium (LD), observations for the presence of the Meselson effect, and by calculating the probability that clonal individuals are more prevalent than would be expected in a randomly mating population. While we found significant deviations from HWE and more clonal individuals than expected, our estimates of the Meselson effect were inconclusive due to limited sampling, and we found no evidence of LD. Therefore, the sexual/asexual status of Z. davisae populations remains uncertain.	[Andersen, J. C.; Camp, C. P.; Davis, M. J.; Elkinton, J.

Integration of molecular, ecological, morphological and endosymbiont data for species delimitation within the Pnigalio soemius complex (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						cryptic species; host specificity; integrative taxonomy; morphometry; Rickettsia; thelytoky	PARASITOID FLIES DIPTERA; DNA-SEQUENCES; HOST-SPECIFICITY; GENE; EVOLUTION; TAXONOMY; ITS2; IDENTIFICATION; LEPIDOPTERA; POPULATIONS	Integrative taxonomy is a recently developed approach that uses multiple lines of evidence such as molecular, morphological, ecological and geographical data to test species limits, and it stands as one of the most promising approaches to species delimitation in taxonomically difficult groups. The Pnigalio soemius complex (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) represents an interesting taxonomical and ecological study case, as it is characterized by a lack of informative morphological characters, deep mitochondrial divergence, and is susceptible to infection by parthenogenesis-inducing Rickettsia. We tested the effectiveness of an integrative taxonomy approach in delimiting species within the P. soemius complex. We analysed two molecular markers (COI and ITS2) using different methods, performed multivariate analysis on morphometric data and exploited ecological data such as hostplant system associations, geographical separation, and the prevalence, type and effects of endosymbiont infection. The challenge of resolving different levels of resolution in the data was met by setting up a formal procedure of data integration within and between conflicting independent lines of evidence. An iterative corroboration process of multiple sources of data eventually indicated the existence of several cryptic species that can be treated as stable taxonomic hypotheses. Furthermore, the integrative approach confirmed a trend towards host specificity within the presumed polyphagous P. soemius and suggested that Rickettsia could have played a major role in the reproductive isolation and genetic diversification of at least two species.

Cryptic Species of Parasitoids Attacking the Soybean Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Asia: Binodoxys communis and Binodoxys koreanus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						cryptic species; Binodoxys communis; Binodoxys koreanus; soybean aphid; parasitoids	CLASSICAL BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; OXIDASE SUBUNIT-I; DNA-SEQUENCE DATA; REPRODUCTIVE COMPATIBILITY; TRICHOGRAMMA-MINUTUM; FLIES DIPTERA; 2 POPULATIONS; GENETIC-VARIATION; HOST-SPECIFICITY; CONTROL AGENTS	Collections of parasitoids attacking the soybean aphid, Aphis glycine Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in South Korea yielded specimens that were originally identified as Binodoxys communis (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). We report here on laboratory studies indicating that this population is actually a previously unknown species of Binodoxys. Four classes of comparisons were made between the Korean population and a Chinese population that also had been identified as B. communis. The comparisons included 1) mating trials coupled with behavioral observations and spermathecal examinations, 2) assessment of nucleotide divergence at two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene loci, 3) patterns of host use, and 4) reassessment of morphological characters. These studies revealed premating reproductive isolation of the two populations and minor nucleotide differences in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequences and nuclear internal transcriber spacer 1 sequences, providing strong indications that they are different species. Subtle morphological differences also were discovered that confirmed that the Chinese population corresponds to B. communis, whereas the Korean population does not:. We propose the name Binodoxys koreanus Stary, sp. n. for the Korean Population. The two species exhibited similar host ranges in the laboratory, the most notable exception being that B. koreanus, sp. n. is better able to develop in a Population of Aphis craccivora Koch that harbors the bacterial endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa Moran, which seems to strongly interfere with the development of B. communis. We discuss the implications of our results for biological control introductions against the soybean aphid in North America.

Geographic variation in male courtship acoustics and genetic divergence of populations of the Cotesia flavipes species complex	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						wing fanning; substrate vibration; population genetic structure; AFLP; biotypes; cryptic species; reproductive isolation; Hymenoptera; Braconidae	SESAMIA-CALAMISTIS LEPIDOPTERA; ALLOPATRIC POPULATIONS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; CAMERON HYMENOPTERA; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; MATING-BEHAVIOR; BUSSEOLA-FUSCA; LIFE-HISTORY; BRACONIDAE; SIGNALS	Courtship behaviors of insect populations can vary across the range of a species. Populations exhibiting divergent courtship behavior may indicate genetic divergence or cryptic species. Courtship acoustic signals produced by male wing fanning and genetic structure (using amplified fragment length polymorphisms) were examined for seven allopatric populations of the Cotesia flavipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) species complex, using four C. sesamiae (Cameron) and three C. flavipes Cameron populations. Members of this species complex parasitize lepidopteran pests in gramineous crops including sugarcane, maize, and rice. Significant variation was detected in courtship acoustic signals and genetic structure among populations of both species. For C. sesamiae, courtship acoustic signals varied more between populations of two biotypes that were collected near an area of sympatry. The two biotypes of C. sesamiae were also genetically divergent. For C. flavipes, significant differences in acoustic signals and genetic structure occurred among allopatric populations; these differences support the recent designation of one population as a new species. Courtship acoustics play a role in reproductive isolation in this species complex, and are likely used in conjunction with chemical signals. Ecological factors such as host range and host plant use may also influence the divergence of both courtship acoustic signals and genetic structure among populations in the C. flavipes complex.

Reproductive isolation due to prezygotic isolation and postzygotic cytoplasmic incompatibility in parasitoid wasps	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						cytoplasmic incompatibility; endosymbiotic bacteria; Lariophagus distinguendus; parasitoid wasps; sexual isolation; speciation	LARIOPHAGUS-DISTINGUENDUS HYMENOPTERA; SEXUAL SELECTION; COTESIA-SESAMIAE; HYBRID INCOMPATIBILITIES; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; CARDINIUM SYMBIONTS; WOLBACHIA; POPULATIONS; BIOLOGY; BRACONIDAE	The reproductive barriers that prevent gene flow between closely related species are a major topic in evolutionary research. Insect clades with parasitoid lifestyle are among the most species-rich insects and new species are constantly described, indicating that speciation occurs frequently in this group. However, there are only very few studies on speciation in parasitoids. We studied reproductive barriers in two lineages of Lariophagus distinguendus (Chalcidoidea: Hymenoptera), a parasitoid wasp of pest beetle larvae that occur in human environments. One of the two lineages occurs in households preferably attacking larvae of the drugstore beetle Stegobium paniceum ("DB-lineage"), the other in grain stores with larvae of the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius as main host ("GW-lineage"). Between two populations of the DB-lineage, we identified slight sexual isolation as intraspecific barrier. Between populations from both lineages, we found almost complete sexual isolation caused by female mate choice, and postzygotic isolation, which is partially caused by cytoplasmic incompatibility induced by so far undescribed endosymbionts which are not Wolbachia or Cardinium. Because separation between the two lineages is almost complete, they should be considered as separate species according to the biological species concept. This demonstrates that cryptic species within parasitoid Hymenoptera also occur in Central Europe in close contact to humans.

J	Kitthawee, S				Kitthawee, Sangvorn			Forced-contact mating: A technique for crossing experiments with the fruit fly parasitoid, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera : Braconidae)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL			English	Article						Diachasmimorpha longicaudata; Bactrocera correcta; Bactrocera dorsalis; forced-mating technique; wingless inheritance; species complex; biological control	ARTIFICIAL-INSEMINATION; TEPHRITIDAE; DIPTERA; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; HAWAII	In this paper, a new technique is described for successfully manipulating the mating of a braconid parasitoid (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) of tephritid fruit flies. This forced-contact-mating technique was first developed for cross-mating experiments to determine the inheritance of winglessness in Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead). Since female D. longicaudata only result from fertilized eggs (unfertilized eggs become males), this mating technique has advantages in the mass production of females for biocontrol releases as well as in investigations on the inheritance of the wingless trait and studies of reproductive isolation among different populations of these parasitoids. Free-mated colonies were generally all winged and predominantly male. Wingless males occurred occasionally but wingless females were rare. Virgin, winged females were immobilized by chilling and placed in close contact With wingless males. Active wingless males readily mounted and mated with immobilized female. Progeny of these mated females were all winged (similar to 83%male and 17% female). When F I females remained unmated they produced both winged and wingless males (similar to 1: 1 ratio) but when immobilized F I females were back-crossed with wingless males, both winged and wingless females (similar to 5:1 ratio) were produced in addition to winged and wingless males. The wingless character was thus determined to be controlled by a recessive gene. Crossing experiments between two different Thai populations of D. longicaudata provided evidence that these populations were reproductively isolated. Among free-mated pairs, some sperm transfer occurred but almost no female progeny were produced. Similarly, among forced-mated pairs, more than double the numbers of females had sperm transferred to their spermatheca, but few female progeny were still produced. This suggests that these two populations are reproductively isolated and are part of a closely related species complex. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Crossing experiments between the two regional parasitoid strains indicated no evidence for their reproductive isolation. More wasps were found on the locally occurring host, E. pseudoconspersa, than on E. taiwana, when virgin females of the two moth species were exposed concurrently in the field for 24 hr in Ibaraki Japan. In Ibaraki, many wasps were caught in traps baited with the synthetic sex pheromone of E. pseudoconspersa, 10, 14-dimethylpentadecyl isobutyrate (10Me14Me-15:iBu), but none with that of E. taiwana, (Z)-16-methyl-9-heptadecenyl isobutyrate (16Me-Z9-17:iBu) or blank traps. In Okinawa, Japan, more wasps were found on E. taiwana than on E. pseudoconspersa, and many wasps were caught in traps baited with 16Me-Z9-17:iBu, but only a few with 10Me14Me-15:iBu, and none with blank traps. These results suggest that local wasp strains discriminate between the two sex pheromones, and they strongly prefer the sex pheromone of the moth occurring at their location.

J	Tooker, JF; Koenig, WA; Hanks, LM				Tooker, JF; Koenig, WA; Hanks, LM			Altered host plant volatiles are proxies for sex pheromones in the gall wasp Antistrophus rufus	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Hymenoptera; Cynipidae; insect; mate location; volatiles		We describe a previously uncharacterized function for changes in plant chemistry induced by phytophagous insects: to provide cues for mate location. Larvae of the gall wasp Antistrophus rufus Gillette (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) feed within inconspicuous galls inside the flowering stems of the prairie perennials Silphium laciniatum L. and Silphium terebinthinaceum Jacquin (Asteraceae). Adult male A. rufus emerge before females and are challenged with locating mates that are sequestered within dead plant stems that occur in a matrix of dead vegetation. Allozyme studies revealed complete reproductive isolation between wasp subpopulations in the two plant species. In laboratory bioassays, males responded only to their natal plant species, antennating the stem surface. Males from S. laciniatum also responded to hexane extracts of S. laciniatum stems, and extracts contained much higher concentrations of monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and camphene) than did S. terebinthinaceum. Ratios of "+" and "-" enantiomers of alpha- and beta-pinene approximated 50:50 for nongalled S. laciniatum stems but strongly differed from 50:50 in galled stems, with "+- and "-" enantiomers strongly dominant in different plants. In bioassays, male wasps from S. laciniatum responded to a synthetic blend of the monoterpenes in enantiomeric ratios characteristic of galled stems. Male A. rufus rely entirely on olfaction to locate females within stems in a complex prairie habitat, and gall wasps themselves apparently influence the plant to modify ratios of monoterpene enantiomers. These plant volatiles serve as a signal for males, acting as a sex pheromone proxy for females concealed within plant tissues.

J	Seifert, B				Seifert, B			Rapid range expansion in Lasius neglectus (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) - an Asian invader swamps Europe	DEUTSCHE ENTOMOLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						morphometry; zoogeography; reproductive isolation; sister species; pest species	ANTS	After its first observation in Europe in 1974, Lasius neglectus Van Loon, Boomsma & Andrasfalvy 1990 has performed a rapid range expansion throughout the entire Mediterranean area and has reached Central Europe. The present range is delimited by 1 degrees E and 75 degrees E and by 36 degrees N and 49 degrees N with 38 sites known. Regarding colony structure, mating, mode of distribution, local dominance, pest status, and impact on local ant faunas, neglectus is comparable to Linepithema hll,humile (Mayr 1868). L, neglectus, however, can establish permanent colonies in regions with mean January temperatures of -5 degreesC. Climatic barriers ending the northern expansion of Linepithema and preventing its long-term outdoor persistence in Central Europe and S Scandinavia will not stop neglectus that has the potency to develop into a most important pest species. Morphology. genetics, and zoogeography suggest a very recent separation of neglectus from Lasius turcicus Santschi 1921 with a most probable radiation centre in Asia Minor, The behavioural change from normal aerial mating to exclusively intranidal mating is considered as deciding step leading to complete reproductive isolation from turcicus. The obvious absence of turcicus from huge parts of neglectus' range is a further argument against considering the two as expression of intraspecific polymorphism. The loss of flight behaviour in queens is still nor accompanied by significant morphological changes: wing load and development of flight muscles or fat tissue are comparable to well-flying and claustrally founding Lasius species.

In haplodiploid reproduction, unfertilized eggs typically develop into uniparental haploid males and fertilized eggs into biparental diploid females. Although this reproductive strategy is common to all Hymenoptera, sex-determination is not strictly specified by the number of genome copies inherited. Furthermore, primary sex-determining signals differ among haplodiploid species. In the honeybee, for example, the primary signal is the genotype at a single, polymorphic locus: diploid animals that are homozygous develop into males while heterozygotes develop into females. Sex determination in Nasonia cannot be explained by this mechanism. Various lines of evidence show that the inheritance of a paternal genome is required for female sexual development and suggest a genomic imprinting mechanism involving an imprinted gene, expressed only from a paternal copy, that triggers female sexual development. In this model, haploid or diploid uniparental embryos develop into males due to a maternal imprint that silences this locus. The genomic imprinting model predicts that a loss-of-function mutation in the paternal copy of the imprinted gene would result in male sexual development in a biparental diploid embryo. In support of this model, we have identified rare biparental diploid males in the F1 progeny of X-ray mutagenized haploid males. Although uniparental diploid male progeny of virgin triploid females have been previously described, this is the first report of biparental diploid males in Nasonia. Our work provides a new, independent line of evidence for the genomic imprinting model of Nasonia sex determination.

Theoretical advances have led to a consensus that a role is plausible when CI is combined with other isolating barriers. However, the insect model systems Nasonia and Drosophila are the only two experimental examples documented. Here, we analyzed the components of reproductive isolation between the parasitoid wasp Encarsia suzannae, which is infected by the CI-inducing symbiont Cardinium, and its uninfected sibling species Encarsia gennaroi. Laboratory crosses demonstrated that: (1) sexual isolation is incomplete; (2) hybrid offspring production is greatly reduced in the interspecific CI cross; (3) viable hybrids may be produced by curing E. suzannae males of Cardinium with antibiotics; (4) hybrid offspring production in the reciprocal cross is greatly reduced by hybrid inviability due to genetic incompatibilities; (5) hybrid sterility is nearly complete in both directions at the F1 stage. Thus, asymmetrical hybrid incompatibilities and CI act as complementary isolating mechanisms. We propose a new model for contributions of CI symbionts to speciation, with CI reducing gene flow between species in one direction, and in the other, a symbiont sweep resulting in accelerated mtDNA evolution, negative cytonuclear interactions, and hybrid incompatibilities.

I aim for a more inclusive model that uses ecological interactions to predict the evolutionary existence of sexual reproduction, sexual reproduction asymmetry, and sex ratios in eusocial species. Using a two-level selection process, with within-population selection on the sex ratio of the sexual caste and between-population selection on the worker sex ratio and the degree of sexual reproduction asymmetry, it is found that a male-haploid genome and a worker caste of pure females is the evolutionary optimum of most initial conditions when, like in eusocial hymenoptera, there is no pair bond between the sexual male and female. That a diploid genome and a worker caste with both males and females is the evolutionary optimum of most initial conditions when, like in eusocial termites, there is a pair bond. That sex-linked genomes may evolve in diploid eusocials, and that the model will not generally maintain sexual reproduction by itself. These results hold for ploidy-levels that behave as quantitative or discrete traits, over a relatively wide range of the relative investment in a sexual male versus sexual female, and for partial sexual systems where the genomic portion with diploid inheritance is either fixed or random.

Feasibility of Using an Alternative Larval Host and Host Plants to Establish Cotesia flavipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in the Temperate Louisiana Sugarcane Ecosystem	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						conservation biological control; refuge; Poaceae; stemborer; energy sugarcane	RELEASE STRATEGIES; BORER LEPIDOPTERA; MANAGEMENT; PYRALIDAE	Attempts to establish Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in Louisiana sugarcane fields to control the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) have been unsuccessful. Experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility of using an alternative larval host and host plants to overcome barriers preventing establishment. In addition, we evaluated C. flavipes' ability to search for D. saccharalis in sugarcane without above-ground internodes. Diatraea evanescens Dyar (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) was investigated as an alternative host for C. flavipes. Cotesia flavipes was reared for five generations on D. evanescens without any indication of diminishing fitness as measured by days to parasite pupation and average cocoon mass weight. However, there was a significant reduction in percent parasitism, cocoon mass weight, and percent emergence when C. flavipes parasitized D. evanescens as compared with D. saccharalis, resulting in a 75% reduction in the gross reproductive rate (R-0). Greenhouse studies indicated little difference in parasitism of D. saccharalis on the weed hosts johnsongrass, Sorghum halepense (L.), and vaseygrass, Paspalum urvillei Steud. However, when planted as refuge plots, we found it difficult to establish infestations of D. saccharalis in either of these hosts, or in two energy sugarcanes. After 3 yr of infesting host plants and releasing parasitoids only one parasitized D. saccharalis larvae was recovered within the johnsongrass refuge. Diatraea evanescens readily established in vaseygrass; however, these larvae appear inaccessible to C. flavipes. In contrast, parasitism of D. saccharalis by C. flavipes infesting young sugarcane was 30%.	[White, W. H.] ARS, USDA, Sugarcane Res Unit, Houma, LA 70360 USA; [Wilson, L.

Their reduced dimensions, highly variable morphological characters and possible effect of wide host range and abiotic factors, make correct identification at the species level particularly difficult. This paper combined molecular, morphological, and biological data to characterize a group of Ooencyrtus spp. emerging from the eggs of the variegated caper bug, Stenozygum coloratura in the east Mediterranean area. COI and ITS2 sequencing revealed the presence of six and five divergent clades, respectively. Three clades were identified as Ooencyrtus telenomicida, Ooencyrtus pityocampae and O. pistaciae. Two clades represent new species which are here described and named Ooencyrtus zoeae and Ooencyrtus mevalbelus. These features were combined with reliable morphological characters to facilitate the separation of these species. A dichotomous key and a new synonymy are proposed. Ooencyrtus pistaciae had two distinct COI clades but only one ITS2 Glade. Crossbreeding trials that included Ooencyrtus telenomicida, Ooencyrtus melvabelus sp. nov. and Ooencyrtus zoeae sp. nov. confirmed their reproductive isolation. COI sequences showed 0-0.8% and 4-9% within and between-species genetic differences, respectively. ITS2 showed 0.4-5.9% genetic differences between species, with no genetic differences within species. Haplotype diversity of Israeli and Turkish populations of the various species was 0-0.98 and was particularly low in Ooencyrtus pityocampae, whose Israeli population showed no diversity. The discovery of the Ooencyrtus spp. on the eggs of the caper bug, and their abundance support the idea that the bug can be used as an alternative host for augmentation of populations of these parasitoids in agricultural and forestry systems.

Non-target host risk assessment of the idiobiont parasitoid Bracon celer (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) for biological control of olive fruit fly in California	BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						olives; biological control; non-target risk; Bactrocera oleae; Bracon celer; Tephritidae	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; CONTROL AGENT; PSYTTALIA-CONCOLOR; DIPTERA; TEPHRITIDAE; CAPE	Non-target risk posed by an African parasitoid, Bracon celer Szepligeti (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), was assessed for a classical biological control program against olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae), in California, USA. Behavioral and reproductive responses to nontarget tephritid species were tested with beneficial (Chaetorellia succinea [Costa] and Parafreutreta regalis Munro) (Tephritidae: Tephritinae) and native (Rhagoletis fausta [Osten Sacken]) (Tephritidae: Trypetinae) fruit fly species in successive no-choice and choice experiments under close confinement in quarantine. Nontarget host-plant substrates exposed to B. celer were yellow-starthistle flower heads containing C. succinea, Cape ivy stem galls containing P. regalis, and bitter-cherry fruit containing R. fausta. The parasitoid probed all three infested nontarget plant substrates, but significantly less than olives infested with B. oleae. It produced offspring from P. regalis in Cape ivy stem galls, but appeared unable to penetrate yellow-starthistle flower heads with its ovipositor. Bracon celer killed some B. oleae and R. fausta larvae without parasitism. Reproduction on P. regalis indicates that B. celer has a broad physiological host range, which, combined with the parasitoid's acceptance of all three host-plant substrates, indicates a strong potential to negatively impact non-target species. Although physical and temporal barriers to host attack may reduce risk to most non-target tephritids by B. celer in California, the parasitoid should not be released due to its risk of harming the beneficial P. regalis. Release of P. regalis is still under consideration, however, and final risk assessment should depend on whether the fly proves useful for weed control.

In insects, mate recognition is often based on chemical cues such as hydrocarbons which are distributed over the insect's cuticle. In the parasitoid wasp genus Nasonia (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), interspecific mating possibly occurs in microsympatry between Nasonia vitripennis Walker and Nasonia giraulti Darling despite post-zygotic isolation mechanisms preventing hybridization. Males of N.vitripennis are known to equally court con- and heterospecific females, which they recognize by means of cuticular hydrocarbons. A recent study surprisingly showed that this might not be the case in N.giraulti, leaving open how males of this species achieve the recognition of mating partners. In this study, we investigated chemical mate recognition in N.giraulti in more detail and compared observed behaviors with behaviors of N.vitripennis by conducting experiments with both species concurrently and under the same experimental conditions. We disentangled the role of female-derived non-polar cuticular lipids - i.e., cuticular hydrocarbons - and more polar cuticular lipids in the ability of males to recognize con- and heterospecific females. In addition, we tested whether females of the two species discriminate similarly between con- and heterospecific males. We demonstrate that, in contrast to N.vitripennis, males of N.giraulti prefer live conspecific females over heterospecific ones. Furthermore, in contrast to N.vitripennis, mate recognition in N.giraulti males is not based on cuticular hydrocarbons, but rather involves other chemical messengers, presumably more polar cuticular lipids. In both species, discrimination against heterospecific males decreases with female age.

For parasitic wasps, mating sites are often confined to where their hosts occur and this mutual interaction therefore greatly affects the evolution of alternative mating strategies. Parasitoids of the genus Nasonia (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) - comprising the species Nasonia vitripennis (Walker), Nasonia longicornis Darling, Nasonia giraulti Darling, and Nasonia oneida Raychouhury & Desjardins - parasitize blowfly pupae and typically mate immediately after emergence of the females from the host puparium. However, in one Nasonia species, N. giraulti, mating predominantly occurs within the host. Here, we re-assess within-host mating (WHM) rates within the Nasonia genus, using laboratory lines and field-collected hosts, including N. oneida for which no data were available yet. We confirm that WHM rates are low in N. vitripennis and N. longicornis, but high in N. giraulti. WHM is rare in N. oneida, despite its sympatry and close phylogenetic relationship with N. giraulti. Multiparasitization experiments with N. vitripennis and N. giraulti resulted in lower WHM proportions of N. giraulti. To evaluate whether this was due to an exit hole in the host pupa created by N. vitripennis males - where an exit hole may result in emergence of N. giraulti females and possibly males prior to mating - we artificially created exit holes in the host parasitized by N. giraulti only. This also yielded a lower WHM proportion. Progeny analysis of interspecific crosses of N. longicornis and N. oneida with N. giraulti, generating hybrid female but non-hybrid male offspring, revealed that WHM is largely determined by the maternal species and, hence, by the species to which the male offspring belong. We conclude that WHM is predominantly a male-mediated trait in N. giraulti, resulting from males refraining from making exit holes and mating with females inside the host. We discuss how these findings can be used to evaluate whether WHM contributes to preventing species hybridization.	[Trienens, Monika; Giesbers, Maartje C. W.

We analysed displays of N. vitripennis X N. longicornis hybrid males. Most of them performed well-organised displays that were intermediate between the parental species. However, in both reciprocal crosses, a significant bias towards the behaviour of the grandpaternal species was observed. Possible explanations for this effect are a biased recovery of genotypes, either due to nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction or non-mendelian transmission, or differential activation of genes in hybrid females. This study is a first step towards unravelling the genetic architecture of courtship behaviour of Nasonia, which may provide information about factors responsible for species isolation.

We studied the behavioural and genetic basis of interspecific mate discrimination in Nasonia wasps, using two strains of N. longicornis (LCa and LId) that differ in female acceptance of males from the sibling species N. vitripennis. Both strains showed low acceptance (<= 2%) of N. vitripennis males in the first courtship, but acceptance by LId females subsequently increased (11% by the second and 15% by the third courtship), whereas acceptance by LCa females remained low (:! 2%). After 2 h of exposure to a N. vitripennis male, 59% of LId females mated compared with only 8% of LCa females. Interstrain cross F1 females showed significantly higher acceptance of N. vitripennis males than either parental strain in the first courtship (15-29%) and after 2 h (79-82%). A genetic analysis of acceptance at 2 h revealed three major quantitative trait loci (QTL). For each major QTL, the allele that increased female mate acceptance was dominant. The QTL with the largest effect accounted for half the strain difference, and was confirmed by additional crosses. This QTL was involved in the females' continued reluctance to mate with N. vitripennis males during multiple courtships. Results are discussed in terms of the behavioural and genetic architecture of female mate discrimination and possible implications to the evolution of courtship, mating systems and reproductive isolation.

However, whether they are sufficient by themselves as the sole cue triggering sexual behavior as well as preference of con-over heterospecific mating partners is rarely assessed. We conducted behavioral assays in three representative species of parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) to determine their reliance on CHC as species-specific sexual signaling cues. Results: We found a surprising degree of either unspecific or insufficient sexual signaling when CHC are singled out as recognition cues. Most strikingly, the cosmopolitan species Nasonia vitripennis, expected to experience enhanced selection pressure to discriminate against other co-occurring parasitoids, did not discriminate against CHC of a partially sympatric species from another genus, Trichomalopsis sarcophagae. Focusing on the latter species, in turn, it became apparent that CHC are even insufficient as the sole cue triggering conspecific sexual behavior, hinting at the requirement of additional, synergistic sexual cues particularly important in this species. Finally, in the phylogenetically and chemically most divergent species Muscidifurax uniraptor, we intriguingly found both CHC-based sexual signaling as well as species discrimination behavior intact although this species is naturally parthenogenetic with sexual reproduction only occurring under laboratory conditions. Conclusions: Our findings implicate a discrepancy in the reliance on and specificity of CHC as sexual cues in our tested parasitioid wasps. CHC profiles were not sufficient for unambiguous discrimination and preference behavior, as demonstrated by clear cross-attraction between some of our tested wasp genera. Moreover, we could show that only in T. sarcophagae, additional behavioral cues need to be present for triggering natural mating behavior, hinting at an interesting shift in signaling hierarchy in this particular species. This demonstrates the importance of integrating multiple, potentially complementary signaling modalities in future studies for a better understanding of their individual contributions to natural sexual communication behavior.

Arthropod Community Associated With the Asexual Generation of Bassettia pallida (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						oak gall; natural enemy hypothesis; crypt gall wasp; crypt keeper wasp; successors	PROMOTES REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; GALL WASPS HYMENOPTERA; SENESCENT STEM-GALLS; OAK GALLS; EREMANTHUS-ERYTHROPAPPUS; LIFE-HISTORY; EVOLUTION; PARASITOIDS; PLANT; CHALCIDOIDEA	Cynipid gall wasps play an important role in structuring oak arthropod communities. Wasps in the Cynipini tribe typically lay their eggs in oaks (Quercus L.), and induce the formation of a 'gall', which is a tumor-like growth of plant material that surrounds the developing wasp. As the wasp develops, the cynipid and its gall are attacked by a diverse community of natural enemies, including parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, and inquilines. Determining what structures these species-rich natural enemy communities across cynipid gall wasp species is a major question in gall wasp biology. Additionally, gall wasps are ecosystem engineers, as the abandoned gall is used by other invertebrates.The gall-associated insect communities residing on live oaks (Quercus geminata Small and Quercus virginiana Mill.) are emerging as a model system for answering ecological and evolutionary questions ranging from community ecology to the evolution of new species. Documenting the arthropods associated with cynipids in this system will expand our understanding of the mechanisms influencing eco-evolutionary processes, record underexplored axes of biodiversity, and facilitate future work. Here, we present the community of natural enemies and other associates of the asexual generation of the crypt gall wasp, Bassettia pallida Ashmead. We compare the composition of this community to communities recently documented from two other cynipid gall wasps specializing on live oaks along the U.S. Gulf coast, Disholcaspis quercusvirens Ashmead and Belonocnema treatae Mayr. B. pallida and their galls support a diverse arthropod community, including over 25 parasitoids, inquilines, and other associated arthropods spanning 5 orders and 16 families.

The taxonomy of the group remains poorly understood due to limited morphological evidence (mostly relying on the morphology of the worker caste), the complete lack of molecular evidence, as well as poor sampling effort: most of the species except G. taivanensis have so far been known only from one or two localities in southern China each, and are allopatric to each other. However, our recent collection of many colonies of G. taivanensis group from three localities (Tay Con Linh, Phia Oac - Phia Den, and Hoang Lien Son) in the northern mountainous region of Vietnam showed remarkable diversity in the external morphology of workers, even within a single locality. The present study thus aims to explore species delimitation of the G. taivanensis group in the region using a combination of phylogenetic and morphometric analyses. Phylogenetic analyses for the genome-wide sequence datasets generated by MIG-seq and morphometric analysis using Nest-Centroid (NC) clustering consistently recovered seven major lineages of the G. taivanensis group (six Vietnamese and one Taiwanese lineages), with four singleton colonies for which these analyses yielded inconsistent and complex pictures. Moreover, the sympatric occurrence of the two or three lineages in each of the three localities of northern Vietnam is indirect evidence of the presence of reproductive isolation among these lineages. These lines of evidence strongly support heterospecificity of the lineages. However, phylogenetic analysis for mitochondrial COI gene showed an almost incompatible pattern with these lineages, possibly due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgressive hybridisation. A future comprehensive study on a larger geographic scale is needed to clarify the placement of the singleton colonies and conduct a formal taxonomic revision of the group.

Additions to the taxonomy of the armadillo ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae, Tatuidris)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article							BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT; DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; LIMITS	The taxonomy of the rare ant genus Tatuidris is revised by studying morphological variability among 118 specimens from 52 collection events in 11 countries, and sequences of Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (CO1 'DNA barcodes') of 28 specimens from 13 localities in 6 countries. Tatuidris are cryptic ants that inhabit the leaf litter of Neotropical forests from Mexico to French Guiana, central Brazil, and Peru. Based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range, T. kapasi is relegated to junior synonymy under T. tatusia. Analysis of barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation. The genus Tatuidris, thus, remains monotypic. Male and female reproductive castes are described for the first time.

A test of the sympatric host race formation hypothesis in Neodiprion (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Sympatric speciation; phytophagous insect; host shift; host race; age-range correlation test; Neodiprion	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; MITOCHONDRIAL INTROGRESSION; PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS; GENE FLOW; SPECIATION; DIVERGENCE; EVOLUTION; BUTTERFLIES; PHYLOGENIES; ADAPTATION	Theory suggests that sympatric speciation is possible; however, its prevalence in nature remains unknown. Because Neodiprion sawflies are host specialists and mate on their hosts, sympatric speciation via host shifts may be common in this genus. Here, we test this hypothesis using near-complete taxonomic sampling of a species group, comprehensive geographical and ecological data, and multiple comparative methods. Host-use data suggest that host shifts contributed to the evolution of reproductive isolation in Neodiprion and previous work has shown that gene flow accompanied divergence. However, geographical data provide surprisingly little support for the hypothesis that host shifts occurred in sympatry. While these data do not rule out sympatric host race formation in Neodiprion, they suggest that this speciation mode is uncommon in the genus and possibly in nature.

Males performed 1-5 courtship bouts with both morphs; about half of all successful matings in both morphs occurred after a single bout. Depending on number of bouts performed, mean courtship durations ranged from 47-268 sec for MFs and 59-277 sec for BFs. Courtship success rates were greater for BF couples (80%) than for MF couples (57%). Compared to BF couples, MF couples were more apt to undergo multiple bouts. Results are interpreted in the context of the morphs' life history and the costs/benefits of alternatives. Failure to initiate any courtship during the 15-min observation period (22% for MF pairs, 21% for BF pairs) appeared to be due to apparent lack of interest or to occasional male violence toward females. Possible explanations for the latter, including mistaken identity, odor contamination, and nutritional stress are discussed.

J	Klopfstein, S; Quicke, DLJ; Kropf, C				Klopfstein, Seraina; Quicke, Donald L. J.; Kropf, Christian			The evolution of antennal courtship in diplazontine parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae, Diplazontinae)	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article							SEXUAL SELECTION; MATING-BEHAVIOR; BIRD SONG; IRREVERSIBLE EVOLUTION; BRETHES HYMENOPTERA; RAPID EVOLUTION; DOLLOS LAW; MALE BEES; SPECIATION; GLANDS	Background: As predicted by theory, traits associated with reproduction often evolve at a comparatively high speed. This is especially the case for courtship behaviour which plays a central role in reproductive isolation. On the other hand, courtship behavioural traits often involve morphological and behavioural adaptations in both sexes; this suggests that their evolution might be under severe constraints, for instance irreversibility of character loss. Here, we use a recently proposed method to retrieve data on a peculiar courtship behavioural trait, i.e. antennal coiling, for 56 species of diplazontine parasitoid wasps. On the basis of a well-resolved phylogeny, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of antennal coiling and associated morphological modifications to study the mode of evolution of this complex character system. Results: Our study reveals a large variation in shape, location and ultra-structure of male-specific modifications on the antennae. As for antennal coiling, we find either single-coiling, double-coiling or the absence of coiling; each state is present in multiple genera. Using a model comparison approach, we show that the possession of antennal modifications is highly correlated with antennal coiling behaviour. Ancestral state reconstruction shows that both antennal modifications and antennal coiling are highly congruent with the molecular phylogeny, implying low levels of homoplasy and a comparatively low speed of evolution. Antennal coiling is lost on two independent occasions, and never reacquired. A zero rate of regaining antennal coiling is supported by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Conclusions: Our study provides the first comparative evidence for a tight correlation between male-specific antennal modifications and the use of the antennae during courtship. Antennal coiling in Diplazontinae evolved at a comparatively low rate, and was never reacquired in any of the studied taxa. This suggests that the loss of antennal coiling is irreversible on the timescale examined here, and therefore that evolutionary constraints have greatly influenced the evolution of antennal courtship in this group of parasitoid wasps. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the loss of antennal coiling is irreversible on larger timescales, and whether evolutionary constraints have influenced courtship behavioural traits in a similar way in other groups.

The aim of this study was to understand how changes in the karyotype such as chromosome number and nuclear genome size accompanied the evolution of neotropical stingless bees, and to discuss these data in a phylogenetic context focusing on the karyotype evolution of this clade. We sampled 38 species representing the three Neotropical Meliponini groups; 35 for karyotype analyses and 16 for 1C value measurement. The chromosome number varied from 2n = 16 to 2n = 34, with distinct karyotypic formulae and the presence of a few polymorphisms, such as B chromosomes in one species and arm size differences between homologous chromosomes in two species. The mean 1C value varied from 0.31 pg to 0.92 pg. We associated empirical data on chromosome number and mean 1C value to highlight the importance of Robertsonian fusion rearrangements, leading to a decrease in chromosome number during the Neotropical Meliponini evolution. These data also allowed us to infer the independent heterochromatin amplification in several genera. Although less frequent, Melipona species with 2n = 22 represent evidence of Robertsonian fissions. We also pointed out the importance of chromosomal rearrangements that did not alter chromosome number, such as inversions and heterochromatin amplification.	[Cunha, M. S.; Campos, L. A. O.; Lopes, D.

The jewel wasp genus Nasonia displays quite strong and well-studied post-zygotic reproductive isolation due to a ubiquitous Wolbachia infection causing cytoplasmic incompatibility between different species. Pre-zygotic isolation, however, has received far less research attention in this model organism, especially concerning the mechanisms and criteria of mate choice. In the present study, we analysed mate rejection and mate acceptance rates in cross-comparisons between all four Nasonia species. We put emphasis on observing which sex is more likely to interrupt interspecific matings and how discriminatory behaviour varies across the different species in all possible combinations. We found an asymmetric distribution of assortative mating among the four Nasonia species that appears to be highly influenced by the respective combinations of sex and species. Females appeared to be the main discriminators against heterospecific mating partners, but interestingly, we could also detect mate discrimination and rejection behaviour in males, a widely neglected factor in research on mating behaviour in general and on Nasonia in particular. Moreover, the asymmetry in the assortative mating behaviour was partially reflective of sym- or allopatric distributions of natural Nasonia populations.

Hybridization in the European carpenter ants Camponotus herculeanus and C. ligniperda (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Sister species; Hybridization; Allometry; Numeric taxonomy; Reproductive barrier	FIRE ANTS	The first case of hybridization between the large European carpenter ants Camponotus herculeanus (Linnaeus 1758) and C. ligniperda (Latreille 1802) is demonstrated by means of exploratory and hypothesis-driven data analyses of standardized phenotypic characters. The strong signal separating the parental species allows the identification of hybrid workers on the individual level, based on only seven characters. The frequency of hybridization between the two species is estimated for Central Europe as 0.2-1.0%. This low ratio indicates strong reproductive barriers considering syntopic occurrence at about 10% of the observation sites, a nearly complete overlap of swarming times and basically equal meteorological conditions to release swarming. The presented case increases the known ratio of hybridizing species within the 178 ant species of Central Europe to 19.1%. This figure dramatically contrasts the known hybridization ratio of 0.55% within an estimated number of 2000 ant species from the Holarctic outside Central Europe. This 30-fold lower discovery rate of hybrids may be explained by the predominance of idiosyncratic species delimitation methods in morphology-based taxonomy in combination with the psychology of human decision-making. A neotype of Camponotus ligniperda is fixed in a specimen from the terra typica and comments on the Latin naming are given.

In groups larger than pairs, reproductive dominance (as measured by oocyte length) was distributed continuously in a graded hierarchy, rather than dichotomously, In groups, workers at a particular dominance rank position developed larger oocytes as group size increased, indicating that a focal bee's Stimulus for reproductive development depends on the number of other bees that are subordinate to it. Attempts to relate ovarian development to visible behavioral manifestations of dominance were inconclusive because antagonistic interactions were infrequent.

The natural defenses and complexity of these ants reduce the impact of potentially useful pathogens for biological control. Furthermore, several types of research with entomopathogenic fungi usually focus on only a few isolates of well-known species, like Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, in addition to not always use isolates obtained from leaf-cutting ants. Here, we evaluated the pathogenicity of several filamentous fungi to workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa. For that, we used fungi previously isolated in an extensive isolation study in Atta spp. reproductive females. Conidia suspensions of Aspergillus flavus, B. bassiana, Isaria fumosorosea and Purpureocillium lilacinum were prepared to a final concentration of 10(8) conidia mL(- 1). In addition, we included sterilized distilled water as control and commercial B. bassiana as standard. Ant workers were immersed in these treatments for eight seconds. The number of dead workers was counted daily. Several fungal isolates killed more, or faster than the standard B. bassiana, showing that they may have a better potential for use in leaf-cutting ants ' biological control. Additionally, the present study reports for the first time the pathogenicity of P. lilacinum and I. fumosorosea towards Atta workers. Thus, we showed that an extensive and specific prospection is of importance for the development of biopesticides for leaf-cutting ants control.

In these species production of males can be induced, but attempts to establish sexual lines have failed in all but one genus. We have found three reproductive barriers between antibiotic-induced males and conspecific females of Muscidifurax uniraptor Kogan and Legner (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae): males do not produce mature sperm. females are reluctant to mate, and a major muscle is absent from the spermatheca. These findings suggest that Wolbachia-induced thelytokous reproduction in M. uniraptor is irreversible, and are consistent with the idea that since sexual reproduction has ceased, selection on sexual traits has been removed leading to the disappearance or reduction in these traits. Because under these circumstances asexual reproduction is irreversible, the host has become totally dependent on the symbiont for reproduction.

Consequently, thynnine genitalia play a multifunctional role and have likely been subject to various different selective pressures for both reproductive success and food provisioning. Here, we present a new molecular phylogeny for the Australian Thynninae and use 3D-geometric morphometrics and comparative methods to investigate the morphological evolution of select genital structures across the group. We found significant morphological integration between all male and female structures analysed, which is likely influenced by sexual selection, but also reproductive isolation requirements and mechanical constraints. The morphology of the primary male and female coupling structures was correlated with female body size, and female genitalia exhibited strong negative size allometry. Those male and female coupling structures have evolved at similar evolutionary rates, whereas female structures appear to have evolved a higher degree of morphological novelty over time. We conclude that the unique reproductive strategies of thynnine wasps have resulted in complex evolutionary patterns in their genital morphology, which has likely played a central role in the extensive diversification of the subfamily across Australasia and South America. Our study reinforces the need to treat composite characters such as genitalia by their component parts, and to consider the roles of both male and female reproductive structures in evolutionary studies.

Recent biological studies indicate that the genus is more diverse than indicated by this traditional view, with evidence supporting at least an additional five species in Asia: A. andreniformis, A. laboriosa, A. koschevnikovi, A. nigrocincta, and a species from the highlands of Borneo. Using morphological characters that are well defined and consistent for each of these species, museum specimens from numerous collections were examined and identified. Detailed collection localities from specimen labels and literature sources, distribution maps, and situations that deserve further study are presented for each of these newly recognized species.

Ecological specialization in Diaeretiella rapae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) on aphid species from wild and cultivated plants	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						host range; host switching; reproductive isolation; non-cultivated areas; agroecosystem; Brevicoryne brassicae; Hayhurstia atriplicis	FITNESS TRADE-OFFS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; HOST-RANGE; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; MORPHOLOGICAL VARIABILITY; PARASITOID COMMUNITIES; APPARENT COMPETITION; SITOBION-AVENAE; PEST-MANAGEMENT; CHEMICAL CUES	Diaeretiella rapae is an aphid parasitoid with potential for use in biological control strategies. However, several recent genetic studies have challenged the long held view that it is a generalist parasitoid. We investigated its ecological specialization and ability to use resources in cultivated and uncultivated areas. Ecological specialization would reduce its ability to exploit the diversity of aphid species, particularly in uncultivated areas, and to control pest aphids. Four D. rapae strains were studied, three reared on pest aphids on Brassicaceae and one strain on a non-pest aphid on Chenopodiaceae. For each strain, we performed host-switching experiments, with a total of six aphid species, five of which D. rapae parasitizes in France. We tested cross-breeding ability between strains to detect potential reproductive isolation linked to aphid host species in D. rapae. The strain reared on non-pest aphids was able to develop on aphid species from both cultivated and uncultivated plants. The strains reared on pest aphids, however, exclusively parasitized aphid species on cultivated Brassicaceae. In addition, reproductive isolation was detected between strains from uncultivated and cultivated plants. Thus, the D. rapae populations examined here appear to be showing ecological specialization or they may even be composed of a complex of cryptic species related to the aphid hosts. The role of Chenopodium album as a reservoir for D. rapae, by providing a habitat for non-pest aphids on which it can feed, appears to be severely limited, and thus its efficiency to maintain local populations of D. rapae in the vicinity of crops is questionable.

Immature developmental times declined from 72 d at 15 degreesC to 13 d at 30 degreesC for females. Male developmental time averaged 96% of female developmental time. Immature survival ranged from 0.23 at 15 degreesC to 0.93 at 25 degreesC, then declined to 0.492 at 33 degreesC. Emerging wasps averaged 0.60 female, with an average of 8.6 and 6-9 progeny produced per parasitized pupa in Musca domestica L. and Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Female longevity declined from I I to 5 d as temperatures increased from 15-33 degreesC. Time to 50% progeny production followed a similar pattern. Lifetime progeny production increased from 28-37 progeny per female at 15 degreesC to 85-120 at 20-25 degreesC, then declined to 48-50 progeny per female at 33 degreesC. The net reproductive rate increased from 1.8-2.3 females at 15 degreesC to 39-48 females/female at 25 degreesC, then declined to 13-15 females per female at 33 degreesC. Mean gene-ration time declined with temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase increased from 0.007-0.010 females/female/d at 15 degreesC to 0.203-0.206 females/female/d at 30 degreesC, then declined to 0.173-0.186 females/female/d at 33 degreesC. M raptorellus bad lower lifetime progeny production, net reproductive rate, and intrinsic rate of increase at all temperatures compared with Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders. Life history parameters of M. raptorellus compared favorably to those of Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan and Legner at all but the highest temperatures, and also with those of Trichomalopsis sarcophagae Gahan at all temperatures. It does not appear that there is any climatic barrier to the use of M. raptorellus for inundative, releases for fly control in Alberta.

Clear species-specificity was found. Ethyl dodecanoate was identified as the major component from the glands of Bombus (Bombus) hypocrita hypocrita and Bombus (Bombus) hypocrita sapporoensis while dihydrofarnesal and dihydrofarnesol were the major components from Bombus (Bombus) ignitus. Citronellol and trans,trans-farnesol were found from Bombus (Pyrobombus) ardens ardens and Bombus (Diversobombus) diversus diversus, respectively. trans,trans-Farnesol was also found from Bombus (Diversobombus) diversus tersatus in Hokkaido. Such differences strongly suggest that these chemicals play an important role in reproductive isolation between sympatric species of Japanese bumblebees.

The reproductive status of a white louse scale 'race' of A. lingnanensis that originated in Thailand was examined in relation to several populations (from Queensland, California and the Philippines) that parasitize California red scale. None of the wasps from red scale mated with individuals from white louse scale in small cages within 10 min, whereas control crosses all mated in that time. The two 'races' would therefore constitute independent reproductive entities (species) in sympatry in the field, although no consistent anatomical differences could be found between them, even with the aid of discriminant function analysis on the number of setae on the delta region of the forewing and the mesoscutum. Aphytis lingnanensis from California red scale in Queensland mated readily with wasps derived from the same host species in California and the Philippines, and mating took place at random among individuals in mate choice tests. Although such results are equivocal, there are no reasons for suspecting that these different populations of A. lingnanensis from California red scale also comprise more than one species. The results obtained indicate that cross-mating tests designed to quantify reproductive isolation between sexual populations are inappropriate. They should rather be designed to establish whether individuals recognize one another as potential mates. The design of cross-mating tests should therefore consider the usual time to mating, of known conspecifics, under the experimental conditions to be used.

Inclusive Fitness of Male and Facultatively Social Female Nesting Behavior in the Socially Polymorphic Bee, Ceratina australensis (Hymenoptera: Xylocopinae)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						small carpenter bee; relatedness; male helpers; mating behavior; diploid males	DIPLOID MALE PRODUCTION; COMPLEX SOCIOGENETIC ORGANIZATION; EUSOCIAL SWEAT BEE; SEX DETERMINATION; FLAVIPES HYMENOPTERA; POPULATION-GENETICS; WORKER PRODUCTION; ISLAND ISOLATION; CARPENTER BEE; SOLITARY BEE	Male hymenopterans do not typically provide help with nest construction or maintenance. This is thought to be due to the decreased relatedness of males to their siblings compared to sisters, and selection for outbreeding resulting in male dispersal from natal nesting sites. However, some instances of male 'helping' behaviors have been observed and can usually be explained by increased access to mating with resident females. Here we report on the first observations of cohabiting males within the nests of reproductive females of the facultatively social small carpenter bee, Ceratina australensis. Social nesting in C. australensis occurs at a consistently low rate across populations. We used microsatellites markers to determine relatedness, combined with 3 yr of nest demographic data collected across three populations, to assess the relative fitness of reproductive, nonreproductive, and male individuals cohabiting in reproductive nests. We found that males were brothers of reproductive females, both remaining in their natal nest. However, there was no evidence that they were mating with their sisters across all nests observed. Males in reproductive nests did not gain any direct or indirect fitness benefits as they did not sire any brood and their presence did not increase brood productivity or survivorship. It is possible that males were waiting to mate with nieces who had not yet emerged. Why males were tolerated remains unknown. Mating biology is an important consideration in social theory which requires additional empirical studies. Future long-term studies are needed to capture unusual social behaviors including male nesting behaviors.

Statistic differences between the hairy N morph (= F. nigricans Emery 1909) and the less hairy P morph in body size, pilosity, geographic frequency, habitat selection and mound construction could be shown but other aspects of external biology coincide. There are no suggestions of reproductive isolation of die morphs which are interpreted as different genotypes of the same population and represent different ecological adaptions. The strong decrease of N morph frequency in pratensis populations from S to N Europe, its higher frequency in more xerothermous habitats in Germany, and its well-documented peculiarity of constructing higher mounds than the P morph for conditions of equal sun-exposure 11hb167003.reicharacterize the N morph as a genotype adapted to higher temperatures. In Germany, as much as 16% of pratensis nests investigated contained both morphs. Polycalic colonies are found in both morphs but isolated nests predominate. Formica minor pratensoides Gosswald 1951 is a synonym of pratensis and refers to polycalic colonies of the P morph which occasionally occur inside more mesophilic, less sun-exposed forests.

However.. the possibility exists that under this specific name a complex of cryptic species may be contained, whose correct identification is essential for their effective use in biological control programmes. In this paper two populations native to Pakistan and Spain,. respectively, were characterized by means of morphometric analysis, crossing experiments and karyological analysis. The two populations, indistinguishable on the basis of single morphological characters, were distinguished through a canonical discriminant function analysis. Mating tests showed rare copulation attempts and no transfer of spermatozoa into the spermatheca in heterogamic crosses, thus suggesting that the Pakistani and Spanish populations are reproductively isolated. Although the two populations shared the same karyotype formula (2n = 2m + 2sm + 6a), consistent differences were found in their chromosome sets. In the Spanish population the metacentric chromosome was almost one half of the whole genome set (rl = 44.23), while in the Pakistani one, it was shorter (rl = 29.55) and as long as the sub-metacentric chromosome. Moreover, silver staining provided evidence of a different localization of the active nucleolus organizer regions (NORs). Results obtained in this study suggest that the Pakistani and Spanish populations are distinct cryptic species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A biochemical characterisation by electrophoresis of these strains concerned 2 enzymatic systems, esterases and superoxide dismutases. The identified alleles show that T. turkestanica belongs to the evanescens group. Some interspecific compatibilities were revealed from crossing experiments between species of that group. Based either on allele frequencies of loci coding for studied enzymes or on data issued from crossing experiments, Nei genetic distances and reproductive isolation indices were respectively calculated. These values allowed to draw 2 dendrograms suggesting that T. brassicae and T. voegelei are the closest species in the evanescens group. Among two hypothetical cladograms based on morphological characters, one suggests that T. evanescens and T. brassicae are the closest species, and the other is consistent with the preceding constructions. Thus, it is likely that the cladogram where T. voegelei and T. brassicae are the closest, corresponds to the phylogeny of the evanescens group. Synonymy between T. turkestanica and T. meyeri Sorokina is discussed.										0	5	5	0	2	SOC ENTOMOLOGIQUE FRANCE	PARIS	45 RUE BUFFON, 75005 PARIS, FRANCE	0037-9271			ANN SOC ENTOMOL FR	Ann. Soc.

In a common garden, we quantified pollinator visitation and flight patterns, differences in corporal attachment of pollinia to insects, and the potential outcome of putative floral barriers for interspecific pollination and fruit set. We detected significant variation in the importance, constancy, and behavior of major pollinators on sympatric asclepiads, including Bombus, Xylocopa and large sphecid wasps. Pollinia attach differentially to the arolium on insect legs for A. syriaca, but to the tarsal hairs in other asclepiads. Fruit-set was lower in mixed than unispecific patches of Asclepias. We detected mechanical isolation between A. syriaca and its congeners and a tendency toward wasp pollination in A. verticillata. All three species appear to show some specialization for long-tongued hymenoptera and lepidopterans. Pre-mating barriers provide a potentially effective means of reducing interspecific pollination, but more study is needed in species visited by generalists.

Many taxa used in biological control may be composed of several population units reproductively isolated to various degrees. Yet, the introductions of non-compatible populations may result in a depression of intended biological control. Cotesia plutellae has been widely used as a biological control agent of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. However, not all introductions and augmentations were successful. With the aim to develop markers of compatibility for this species, we studied the reproductive compatibility between five populations (South Africa, Benin, Martinique, Reunion, and Taiwan) and analyzed its statistical relationship with three morphological characters (antennae and body length and antennae/body ratio), one molecular character (sequence of a cytochrome b fragment) and the Wolbachia infection status. This study shows that C plutellae populations formed two interbreeding groups. The antenna/body length ratio of females, the ratio between male and female body length, one non-silent base pair substitution observed in cytochrome b sequences, and Wolbachia infection status differentiate these groups and were all good predictors of reproductive compatibility. Our results suggest also that genetic factors independent from Wolbachia are needed to fully explain reproductive isolation between C plutellae populations. We conclude that C plutellae is a single species composed of at least two partially incompatible population aggregates. Diagnostic markers were proposed for the prediction of the level of reproductive compatibility between populations which can be used for further biocontrol introductions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Seifert, B				Seifert, B			Interspecific hybridisations in natural populations of ants by example of a regional fauna (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Formicidae; hybridisation frequencies; reproductive strategies; fluctuating asymmetries	INTRODUCED FIRE ANTS; HYBRIDIZATION; HYBRID	The identification of hybrids by high-precision stereomicroscopy and chorological data is described in detail by example of the ant species Formica bruni and pressilabris. In a synopsis of heterogenous data, the overall hybrid frequency in the ant fauna of Central Europe is estimated. 17 of the 164 ant species of this region are demonstrated and further 2 species strongly suspected to hybridise. The low-frequency hybridisers, showing overall hybrid ratios < 3%, were native elements of the Central European fauna before the onset of human cultivation and experienced direct interspecific contact for longer periods of their natural history. They developed more effective mechanisms of reproductive isolation beginning at the prezygotic level. Extremely high (12-31%) local hybridisation ratios occurred in species that invaded the area after anthropogenic changes in landscape structure. The segregated distribution of invaders and autochthonous species in the precultural period apparently did not impose the need to evolve more effective mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Prezygotic mechanisms in particular are deficient. In local situations, 19% of Lasius jensi matings and 44% of Leptothorax albipennis matings leading to successful nest foundations were matings with heterospecific partners. Signs for a dissolution of interspecific phenotypic differences are not detectable in most of the species. The dispersal of hybrid genotypes is apparently inhibited. Factors that probably stabilise the genomic integrity of hybridizing parent species are: (a) inability to produce hybrid queens tin L. jensi x umbratus), (b) aneuploidy of F(1) females with inability to perform a balanced meiosis tin hybrids of L. albipennis with 3 other species), and (c) selection against hybrids in the epigenetic environment of alleles (Leptothorax nylanderi x slavonicus). Extreme ratios of heterospecific matings would mean a dangerous drain of genetic material. A mechanism to reduce these losses is postulated consisting of a 'cleptogamy' (theft of heterospecific sperm) by queens that missed a conspecific male, an establishment of a functioning colony of F(1) hybrid workers, a depression of the rearing or fertility of hybrid queens, and a maximum production of own sons by the queen. This mechanism could explain the persistence of rare species (Lasius jensi or Leptothorax albipennis) in an environment of more populous heterospecific hybridisation partners.

In some Wolbachia-infected hosts, no effect (N) has been found. Successful transfer of Wolbachia by microinjection from one host to an uninfected one has been established with CI, F, N-Wolbachia but not with T-Wolbachia. In this paper a transfer experiment of T-Wolbachia from the parasitoid Muscidifurax uniraptor to Drosophila simulans is described. The infection could be detected in the new host for several generations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, no specific effects on the host were detected, and the bacteria were not stably maintained.

In this article I compare original data to those from previously published studies of H. rubicundus in a variety of environments. I describe nest structure, nest density, bee size, reproductive output, sex ratio, and incidence of predators and parasites. From the patterns that emerge, I conclude that nest-site philopatry is important in structuring populations so that social behavior is favored over bivoltinism in warm climates. The sex ratio of populations is correlated with photoperiod but the relationship is not absolute; therefore, I propose that some other causal factor or a combination of factors, such as temperature or resource availability, is involved. The same mechanism may be responsible for changes in female size during the season. Differences in social behavior do not appear to provide a barrier to reproduction, and the presence of different forms does not imply incipient speciation.

The French strain, collected on Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), although capable of parasitizing and producing viable offspring on Sitona weevils, preferred Hypera weevils, its known target host. The Moroccan strain, collected on Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal, exhibited host specificity for Sitona. A partial reproductive isolation was observed between the mio strains. Moroccan females mated more frequently with French males than did French females with Moroccan males. The pre-copulation time for mating pairs of opposite strains was significantly longer than that for mating pairs of the same strain. There was no significant difference in copulation time nor in larval and pupal duration between French and Moroccan strains. In summary, the French and Moroccan strains of M. aethiopoides are clearly separable by biological, behavioral, and morphometric traits and the preferred host for Hypera is the French strain and Sitona for the Moroccan strain. Consequently, geographic location and host source become important when considering this parasitoid as a potential biological control agent.

To improve the performance of that wasp as a natural enemy, the nature of its uniparental reproduction was studied. It was found that the production of males can be induced by antibiotic treatments, but attempts to establish a biparental G, fausta line have failed. The reproductive barrier between antibiotic-induced males and conspecific females appears to be the non-receptivity of females. The results imply involvement of microorganisms in the thelytokous reproduction of G. fausta, but no Wolbachia was detected in polymerase chain reaction.

A discriminant function analysis yielded three morphoclusters: group 1 comprising an unnamed population at higher than 1500 m altitude in the mountains; group 2 consisting of bees considered to be A. m. scutellata x A. capensis hybrids, and group 3 consisting of A. m. scutellata surrounding the mountains at lower (less than 1500 m) altitudes. The bees of group 1 show size similarities to disjunct populations of other large Afromontane bees, A. m. monticola. Group 2 hybrid bees occur in an area of marked climatic variability and manifest significantly high variances in their morphometrics, pheromones and DNA characteristics. It is suggested that differences in swarming seasons among these populations effectively cause temporal reproductive isolation between the group 1 mountain bees and those A. m. scutellata below the escarpment.

The lines differed most in the number of hosts parasitized in 24 h and the developmental times of females and males. Cluster and discriminant analysis showed that these differences were pronounced between line I, line II and lines III-VI, but not between lines III, IV, V and VI. Cross-breeding experiments revealed reproductive barriers between the lines which proved to differ most in life history traits, indicating the possible existence of morphologically similar species. Given the variability in life history traits between lines of A. abdominalis recorded in this study, we suggest a careful selection of candidate strains for biological control will be rewarding.

In the present study, we attempted to detect the allele-specific ftsZ gene of Wolbachia in Cotesia spp. obtained from different geographical locations. Samples of Cotesia plutellae originating from India (Bangalore and Ludhiana), Kenya, and South Africa and samples of C. glomerata from India (Solan) confirmed the presence of Wolbachia. However, C. plutellae samples from the Kullu region of India did not show infection with Wolbachia. ftsZ sequences showed a high degree of homology within the species (> 99%). The low genetic distance in the infected Cotesia populations indicated a single ancestral type, and distance to and from the outgroup suggested that populations are from the same species. Phylogenetic grouping of Cotesia species on the basis of geographic origin showed that the Wolbachia strain is closely related to strains that infect phylogenetically distant hosts.

Genetic analyses reveal cryptic diversity in the native North American fire ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Solenopsis)	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							GLOBAL INVASION HISTORY; SPECIES DELIMITATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; EVOLUTIONARY HOTSPOTS; PHYLOGENETIC TREES; SOFTWARE; XYLONI; MICROSATELLITE; IMPLEMENTATION; STATISTICS	The native North American fire ants (SolenopsisWestwood) comprise a difficult group taxonomically that has undergone multiple revisions in the past century yet remains in a state of taxonomic uncertainty. In the present study, we utilised a set of 59 microsatellite markers analysed in 238 specimens to conduct the first robust genetic analysis of the four nominal species. Our approach used a variety of methods to test operational criteria commonly employed in species delimitation, including genotypic clustering, reproductive isolation/cohesion and monophyly. We conclude from our results that the recognised North American fire ant species represent evolutionarily independent entities and, moreover, we confirm the presumed sister status of the desert fire ants, S. aureaWheeler and S. amblychilaWheeler. However, the presence of at least two genetically divergent populations within the nominal species boundaries, including a western form of S. xyloni and a distinct population of S. aurea endemic to the Salton Trough, suggests that the current taxonomy does not fully capture the species-level diversity in this group. Our study provides the molecular foundation for future integrated studies of the taxonomy and evolution of this scientifically and economically important group of insects.

Yet each plant species is a microhabitat with distinct chemical and physical attributes that may drive selection and diversification of insects. This study examines differences in courtship vibration signal transmission through leaves of three host plant species that vary in physical characteristics (leaf tissue density, leaf width and percent moisture) and how signal transmission relates to mating success for a parasitoid wasp. The vibration signals transmit with a longer duration and a higher relative amplitude in the host plant leaves of the species with the lowest leaf tissue density, which was also the plant type with the highest mating frequency. Host plants may be a selective force on courtship vibration signals and may contribute to the behavioral or genetic divergence of populations on different host plant species.

Ten of 776 (1.3%) host nests were parasitized at a site in central Arizona, while none of 1499 potential host colonies were parasitized at two other locales. Colonies of P. colei are perennial, and host alate females in 9 of 10 colonies demonstrates that host queens survive parasitism. Three of 10 colonies died over 19 colony years of observation, while only 1 of 601 colonies became newly parasitized. Mating occurs in morning for up to 2-3 days following summer and fall rains and in afternoon during cool fall days. Mating is intranidal just outside the nest entrance, with males returning to the natal nest. Male P. colei may be flightless because their wing area is reduced compared to host males. Females fly from the nest and locate potential host colonies by following trunk trails. Workers are the largest barrier to nest establishment, as they removed over 90% of P. colei females placed in trunk trails or that entered host nests. Males and females of P. colei and P. anergismus, the only other congeneric inquiline species, are diminutive compared to their hosts, with females 30% lighter than host workers. Fat content is lower and water content is higher in P. colei and P. anergismus females than in their hosts.

J	Yazdi, AB; Munch, W; Seifert, B				Yazdi, Ali Bagherian; Muench, Wolfgang; Seifert, Bernhard			A first demonstration of interspecific hybridization in Myrmica ants by geometric morphometrics (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)	MYRMECOLOGICAL NEWS			English	Article						Myrmica; hybridization; geometric morphometrics; relative warps analysis; fluctuating asymmetry; directional asymmetry; temporary social parasitism	VOUCHER SPECIMENS; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; EXTRACTION; TAXONOMY; MUSEUMS; RECORDS	A case of hybridization between Myrmica scabrinodis NYLANDER, 1846 and M. vandeli BONDROIT, 1920 is demonstrated by means of geometric morphometrics in a nest sample found in Baden-Wurttemberg/Germany. 41 land marks and 252 semilandmarks were fixed in four anatomical aspects in 299 worker ants - dorsal head, frontodorsal clyperus, dorsal mesosoma and lateral petiole. 316 relative warps (RWs) were extracted from the shape variables. Shape differences between these very similar species are visualized by mean deformation grids exaggerated by the factor of three. Among a number of differences already known, geometric morphometrics revealed also differences not discovered so far by conventional morphometrics or subjective character assessment. A full separation of the parental species was provide by the first two RWs of the head and clypeus aspect by this approach was not sufficient to reliably demonstrate hybrid identities on individual level. A stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) using the RWs as characters and reducing character number form 316 to 25, offered very powerful separation of the 291 workers of the parental species (F = 6735.1, ANOVA) and placed the eight workers of the hybrid sample in a coherent cluster exactly in the empty space between the parental species. Basically similar results were achieved with conventional linear morphometrics considering 16 characters but this system was less powerful (F = 3108.0, ANOVA) and placed two specimens of the parental species close to the hybrids. There was no directional asymmetry detectable in the whole material and the hybrid sample did not show increased fluctuating asymmetry. With the current methodology applied, data acquisition time was 48 minutes per specimen in conventional linear morphometrics but as much as 160 minutes in geometric morphometrics. The main problems of the latter method are the slowness of the automatic z-stack imaging methods and the absent software assisting land fixation. A considerable reduction of total data acquisition time to 84 (one-fold digitizing) or to 108 minutes (two-fold digitizing) per specimen is predicted if a grid-and-sector system assisting landmark fixation is automatically projected on the screen. The overall hybridization frequency for the region of Baden-Wurttemberg is estimated as 0.44% from the side of M. vandeli and 0.03% from the side of M. scabrinodis. Despite apparently strong reproductive barriers between M. scabrinodis and M. Vandeli, rare hybridization may occur because of the constant and extremely close spatial association, largely overlapping swarming times and some aspects of male mating behavior. Myrmica vandeli is very likely a facultative temporary social parasite of M. scabrinodis. As much as 17% of the 225 M. vandeli nests found in Baden-Wurttemberg still contained M. scabrinodis workers.

Sperm parasitism in ants: Selection for interspecific mating and hybridization	ECOLOGY			English	Review						Acanthomyops; ants; cleptogamy; dispersal polymorphism; hybridization; hybridogenesis; Lasius; mating strategies; mixed ESS; sperm parasitism	GENETIC CASTE DETERMINATION; SEX-INVESTMENT RATIOS; LASIUS-NIGER; CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; NATURAL HYBRIDIZATION; HARVESTER ANTS; FIRE ANT; HYBRID; HYMENOPTERA	Interspecific mating in eusocial Hymenoptera can be favored under certain conditions even if all hybrid offspring are completely infertile. This exploits two key features of the eusocial Hymenoptera: a haplodiploid genetic system and reproductive division of labor in females. Interspecifically mated queens can still produce viable sons that will mate intraspecifically. Apparent reduced fitness resulting from producing infertile daughter gynes can be also offset by advantages conferred by hybrid workers. An important advantage is likely to be superior ability at using marginal habitats. Interspecifically mated queens can nest in sites where intraspecific competition will be low. By mating interspecifically, a queen trades expected reproductive success through female offspring for a higher probability of achieving some reproductive success. Females that mate interspecifically can be considered "sperm parasites'' on the males of the other species. I provide evidence that sperm parasitism is responsible for widespread hybridization in North America among two species of the ant subgenus Acanthomyops (genus Lasius), and review evidence for sperm parasitism in other hybridization phenomena in ants. Sperm parasitism in ants represents a novel form of social parasitism in ants and a dispersal polymorphism. It may also act as a precursor to the evolution of some other recently discovered phenomena, such as genetic caste determination.

DNA sequences were analyzed using parsimony, distance and maximum likelihood methods to investigate phylogenetic relationships within Apis. The phylogenctic analyses strongly supported the basic topology recoverable from morphometric analysis, grouping the honey bees into three major clusters: giant bees (A. dorsata, A. binghami, and A. laboriosa), dwarf bees (A. andreniformis and A. florea), and cavity-nesting bees (A. mellifera, A. cerana, A. koschevnikovi, A. nuluensis, and A. nigrocincta). However, the clade of Asian cavity-nesting bees included paraphyletic taxa. Exemplars of Apis cerana collected from divergent portions of its range were less related to each other than were sympatric A. cerana, A. nuluensis, and A. nigrocincta taxa. Nucleotide sequence divergence between allopatrically distributed western (A. mellifera) and eastern (A. cerana, A. koschevnikovi, A. nigrocincta, and A. nuluensis) cavity-nesting species, around 18% for the mitochondrial gene and 10-15% for the nuclear intron, suggested an earlier divergence for these groups than previously estimated from morphometric and behavioral studies. This latter finding neccessitates reevaluation of the hypothesized origin of extant European, African, and west Asian Apis mellifera. Sequence divergence between A. laboriosa and A. dorsata was consistent with behavioral data and supports the species status of A. laboriosa. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These unfertilized eggs may be injected with sperm, and some, successfully completing fertilization, develop as diploid females. Premating reproductive isolation exists between two sympatric species of this family, Athalia rosae ruficornis Jokovlev and Athalia infumata Marlatt. Taking advantage of the difference in karyotypes, it is shown that hetero-specific sperm injection results in successful fertilization and that the hybrid survives at least through the middle stage of embryogenesis.

We assayed mound soil, plant debris within the mounds, and ants obtained from mounds on 3 sampling dates (March, July, and November). We processed samples based on standard microbiological protocols, and used traditional morphological and molecular techniques to identify fungal taxa. We documented a total of 1445 isolates consisting of 50 fungal taxa and calculated a diversity index value (H') of 3.11 across all substrates, which was indicative of a variable fungal community within the mounds. The taxa with the highest percent isolation frequencies included Hypocrea lixii (12.8%), Fusarium sp. 1 (12.3%), Fusarium equiseti (7.9%), Purpureocillium lilacinum (= Paecilomyces lilacinus) (6.5%), Fusarium oxysporum 2 (5.8%), and Mortierella alpina (5.4%). We isolated 2 common parasitic (entomopathogenic) fungi, Purpureocillium lilacinum and Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (9.4%), from mound soil, plant debris, and ant external tissues. Hypocrea lixii, the teleomorphic reproductive stage of Trichoderma harzianum, is noted as a natural biological control of some soil-borne microbes, possibly limiting important natural entomopathogenic activity within the mounds. Species richness and diversity values from mound soils across locations were significantly greater (P <= 0.05) than those from the plant debris and ant body-tissue substrates. Species richness values between locations were similar. Species richness of samples collected in November (47) was significantly greater (P <= 0.05) than that of the March (41) and July (39) samples. Community coefficient values ranged from 0.79 to 0.87 between substrates, 0.85 to 0.91 between locations, and 0.85 to 0.86 between sampling dates, indicating that taxa were similar.

One ecologically and economically important group that requires attention is the hymenopteran family Braconidae, which is estimated to include thousands of undescribed species. Here we assessed the genetic structure and species diversification in the braconid wasp genus Allorhogas Gahan (Doryctinae) that were reared from galls of five cynipid wasp species associated with three live oak species (Fagaceae: Quercus: subsection Virentes) in the southeastern United States. We explored genetic variation in the single-locus barcoding COI region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and conducted analyses with different DNA sequence-based species delimitation approaches both for the above marker and genome-wide nuclear data using ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We found high variation in the mtDNA barcoding region among specimens of Allorhogas reared from galls made by different cynipid species in distinct plant organs and among specimens reared from the same type of gall from two separate geographic regions. In addition, our analyses of mtDNA and multilocus nuclear data were concordant in consistently delimiting at least five genetic lineages. We combined this molecular evidence with morphological data to describe four new species and redescribe the type species of the genus, Allorhogas gallicola Gahan, which exhibited similar morphological, ecological, and biogeographic characteristics to the four new species. This study highlights the importance of carrying detailed rearing surveys to uncover the intricate species interactions and species diversity that is present in gall-former systems.

Reconstructing the relatedness of cooperatively breeding queens in the Panamanian leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)	MYRMECOLOGICAL NEWS			English	Article						Polygyny; social parasitism; inquilines; leaf-cutting ants	SOCIAL PARASITISM; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; KIN SELECTION; COLONY; EVOLUTION; NUMBER; STRATEGIES; INQUILINE; HOST; AGGRESSION	The evolution of permanent inquiline social parasites in ants has been conjectured to be facilitated by secondary polygyny, that is, the re-adoption of new queens into existing mature colonies. This idea was first formulated by Wasmann, Wheeler, and Emery more than a century ago. Emery predicted that inquilines should be the sister-lineages of their hosts, which prompted Alfred Buschinger to propose that they evolve by sympatric speciation. However, these scenarios hinge on two vital conditions that have not been quantitatively documented: 1. That host sister species are secondarily polygynous and primarily recruit close kin, and 2. That such adoptions are prone to occasional mistakes that would select for the condition-dependent expression of exploitative traits and reproductive isolation by disruptive selection. Here, we use a long-term data set on the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior (FOREL, 1899), known to have a closely related inquiline social parasite A. insinuator SCHULTZ, BEKKEVOLD & BOOMSMA, 1998, to address the first of these conditions. We estimate the frequency of secondary polygyny and the degree to which cooperatively breeding queens are related. We find that the overall frequency of polygynous colonies is ca. 8% and that polygynous colonies typically have two queens. Most queen pairs are first-degree relatives, consistent with colonies adopting one or two daughters either before or just after becoming orphaned. However, we also document a few pairs of cooperatively breeding queens that are unrelated and estimate that this social structure may apply to ca. 20% of the polygynous colonies, and thus ca. 1% of all colonies. Our findings show that the breeding system of A. echinatior matches the polygyny characteristics that are believed to facilitate the emergence of socially parasitic queen morphs.

The spermatheca of P. erthrocephalus was located closely above the vagina. It consists of a spherical reservoir, a paired elongated gland and a duct connecting the reservoir to the vagina. The duct and reservoir consist of a single epithelial layer. This layer is formed by columnar cells rich in mitochondria. In addition, we observed several basal cell membrane infoldings associated with mitochondria in the reservoir epithelium. These characteristics stressed the possible role of the component cells in exchange processes between hemolymp and spermatheca lumen. The duct and the reservoir epithelia are surrounded by a further epithelial tissue: the spermatheca sheath. This is a layer of spindle-like cells that may contribute to spermatozoa isolation and maintenance. The present work provided the first description of the spermatheca morphology in the reproductive females of P. erythrocephalus that can be used as a basis for future specific studies about reproduction, caste or behaviour characteristics of Polistinae.

In vitro studies have revealed that venom inhibits the motility and aggregation of the host larval hemocytes. Bioactive genes with immunosuppressive activity were investigated by screening of the venom gland Transcriptome of the wasp Bracon hebetor by using manual BLAST X analysis and functional annotation of the selected contigs. The 5' ends of the selected genes were obtained using RACER kit (Invitrogen) and full length genes were isolated. Cloning and sequencing of the genes were performed and further characterized using bioinformatic tools i.e., Expasy Translate Tool, Clustal Omega and SignalP. Deduced amino acid sequences of the isolated genes (Venom acid phosphatase, Tryptase-2 and CTD nuclear envelope phosphatase) showed significant homologies with other Braconid species, whereas Tiyptase-2 and CTD nuclear envelope phosphatase showed good secretory role. Further, in depth studies are required for the expression of isolated genes and their functional analysis. This is the first report of the characterization of immune suppressive genes from the venom gland of B. hebetor which may be useful for developing benign control tactics for insect pests of agricultural crops.

Although T. plautiae was synonymized with T. japonicus (Ashmead) in 1981, both scientific names have been used for the same egg parasitoid of P. stali for about the past 30 years because of their taxonomic confusion. To promote an effective IPM program for P. stali using its egg parasitoids, we attempted to resolve the confusion by the use of a variety of methods. On detailed observation of adult morphology, we found that sublateral setae on the T1 are present in T. plautiae and absent in T. japonicus, and that this morphological difference is corroborated by more subtle differences between the two species. This finding supports the view that they are different species. The view was also supported by the results of mating experiments to determine the reproductive isolation of T. plautiae from T. japonicus and DNA analysis of these two species. We conclude that T. plautiae is a cryptic species of T. japonicus and resurrect T. plautiae from T. japonicus stat. rev.

Most work has focused on postzygotic reproductive barriers, and the influence of ploidy differences on prezygotic barriers is understudied. To address these gaps, we quantified hybrid occurrence, interspecific self-compatibility differences, and the contributions of multiple pre- and postzygotic barriers to reproductive isolation between diploid Erythronium mesochoreum (Liliaceae) and its tetraploid congener Erythronium albidum. Reproductive isolation between the study species was nearly complete, and naturally occurring hybrids were infrequent and largely sterile. Although postzygotic barriers effected substantial reproductive isolation when considered in isolation, the study species' spatial distributions and pollinator assemblages overlapped little, such that interspecific pollen transfer is likely uncommon. We did not find evidence that E. albidum and E. mesochoreum differed in mating systems, indicating that self-incompatibility release may not have fostered speciation in this system. Ultimately, we demonstrate that E. albidum and E. mesochoreum are reproductively isolated by multiple, hierarchically-operating barriers, and we add to the currently limited number of studies demonstrating that early acting barriers such as pollinator-mediated isolation can be important for effecting and sustaining reproductive isolation in diploid-polyploid systems.

We investigated these points in Cotesia sesamiae, an African parasitic wasp of cereal stem borers. Phylogenetic analyses of 74 individual wasps, based on six mitochondrial and nuclear genes, revealed three lineages. We then investigated the ecological status (host plant and host insect ranges in the field, and host insect suitability tests) and the biological status (cross-mating tests) of the three lineages. We found that one highly supported lineage showed all the hallmarks of a cryptic species. It is associated with one host insect, Sesamia nonagrioides, and is reproductively isolated from the other two lineages by pre- and postmating barriers. The other two lineages had a more variable phylogenetic support, depending on the set of genes; they exhibited an overlapping and diversified range of host species and are not reproductively isolated from one another. We discuss the ecological conditions and mechanisms that likely generated this ongoing speciation and the relevance of this new specialist taxon in the genus Cotesia for biological control.

GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE AND LABORATORY STUDIES ON APANTELES OPUNTIARUM (HYMENOPTERA: BRACONIDAE) IN ARGENTINA, A CANDIDATE FOR BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF CACTOBLASTIS CACTORUM (LEPIDOPTERA: PYRALIDAE) IN NORTH AMERICA	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						Cactus moth; Apanteles; reproductive success; field occurrence; parasitoid attack rates; Wolbachia	WOLBACHIA; RISK	The cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is a pest that threatens native Opuntia spp. in North America. Control tactics developed and implemented against this invasive pest successfully eradicated the moth in Mexico and on barrier islands in the United States. However, with the cancellation of the regional management program in the United States, no control tactics are being implemented to mitigate the expansion of the moth's geographical range. Hence, an integrated approach including biological control is proposed to regulate the population of C. cactorum in North America. Field surveys of the recently described parasitoid, Apanteles opuntiarum Martinez & Berta, were carried out within the C. cactorum native range in Argentina, and laboratory studies were conducted to develop a parasitoid rearing protocol. Apanteles opuntiarum was the most common parasitoid of C. cactorum and their field distributions were similar. In the laboratory, the parasitoid's reproductive success was maximized when one or two female wasps were exposed to 30 host larvae within a 500 ml container. Laboratory reared females were less successful at parasitizing hosts than field collected females. In spite of the success achieved with laboratory rearing, male bias was observed throughout the experiments. Because this bias might be related to the presence of the reproductive parasite Wolbachia, both laboratory colony and field collected individuals were screened and Wolbachia was detected. This study provides useful field and laboratory information on (1) laboratory rearing techniques for A. opuntiarum; (2) developing host specificity test protocols for studies under quarantine conditions; and (3) selecting parasitoid populations that best match the climatic conditions present in the C. cactorum invaded areas of North America.

Egg load was defined as the number of mature (i.e., fully-chorionated) eggs found in the ovaries and oviducts. Significantly more mature eggs were stored in honey-fed than starved females. For honey-fed females, egg load increased within several days of isolation from hosts. This study suggests that C. marginiventris is weakly synovigenic because females emerge with a considerable number of mature eggs and are capable of maturing many more eggs. Feeding on a suitable source of carbohydrate should increase the egg load (i.e., potential fecundity) of this insect within 3-4 days in an in vivo rearing system.

Parasites of aphids are mostly endoparasitoid insects, i.e. insects which,lay eggs inside the body of an other insect which will die as a result of their development. In this article, we review the consequences of the numerous pecularities of aphid biology and ecology for their endoparasitoids, notably the Aphidiinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). We first examine the various mechanisms used by aphids for defence against these enemies. We then explore the strategies used by aphidiine parasitoids to exploit their aphid hosts. Finally, we consider the responses of both aphids and parasitoids to ecological constraints induced by seasonal cycles and to environmental variations linked to host plants and climate. The fundamental and applied interest of studying these organisms is discussed. (C) 2010 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Intraspecific Geographic Variation of Fragrances Acquired by Orchid Bees in Native and Introduced Populations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Hymenoptera; Monoterpenes; Sesquiterpenes; Pheromone evolution; Euglossini; Invasive species; Orchids; Bees; Triclopyr BEE	MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES; APIDAE; MOTH; HYMENOPTERA; COLLECTION; DIFFERENTIATION; ACCUMULATION; EVOLUTION	Male orchid bees collect volatiles, from both floral and non-floral sources, that they expose as pheromone analogues (perfumes) during courtship display. The chemical profile of these perfumes, which includes terpenes and aromatic compounds, is both species-specific and divergent among closely related lineages. Thus, fragrance composition is thought to play an important role in prezygotic reproductive isolation in euglossine bees. However, because orchid bees acquire fragrances entirely from exogenous sources, the chemical composition of male perfumes is prone to variation due to environmental heterogeneity across habitats. We used Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to characterize the perfumes of 114 individuals of the green orchid bee (Euglossa aff. viridissima) sampled from five native populations in Mesoamerica and two naturalized populations in the southeastern United States. We recorded a total of 292 fragrance compounds from hind-leg extracts, and found that overall perfume composition was different for each population. We detected a pronounced chemical dissimilarity between native (Mesoamerica) and naturalized (U.S.) populations that was driven both by proportional differences of common compounds as well as the presence of a few chemicals unique to each population group. Despite these differences, our data also revealed remarkable qualitative consistency in the presence of several major fragrance compounds across distant populations from dissimilar habitats. In addition, we demonstrate that naturalized bees are attracted to and collect large quantities of triclopyr 2-butoxyethyl ester, the active ingredient of several commercially available herbicides. By comparing incidence values and consistency indices across populations, we identify putative functional compounds that may play an important role in courtship signaling in this species of orchid bee.

While beneficial, it does not provide a high degree of biological pest control against its host, the saw-toothed beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Silvanidae). A candidate explanation for poor host population suppression is that adult females interfere with each other's foraging and reproductive behavior. We used simple laboratory microcosms to evaluate such mutual interference in terms of its overall effects on offspring production. We varied the density of the hosts and also the spatial structure of the environment, via the extent of population sub-division and the provision of different substrates. Production of C. tarsalis offspring was positively influenced by host density and by the isolation of females. With incomplete sub-division within microcosms offspring production was, in contrast, low and even zero. The provision of corrugated paper as a substrate enhanced offspring production and partially mitigated the effects of mutual interference. We recommend simple improvements to mass rearing practice and identify promising areas for further behavioral and chemical studies towards a better understanding of the mechanisms of mutual interference.

J	Cahenzli, F; Bonetti, C; Erhardt, A				Cahenzli, Fabian; Bonetti, Christophe; Erhardt, Andreas			Divergent strategies in pre- and postzygotic reproductive isolation between two closely related Dianthus species	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Dianthus carthusianorum; Dianthus sylvestris; extrinsic postzygotic isolation; reciprocal transplant experiments; reproductive isolation barriers; speciation	NATURAL-SELECTION; POLLINATION; BARRIERS; SPECIATION; RATES; RADIATIONS; COMPONENTS; STRENGTH	Quantifying the relative contribution of multiple isolation barriers to gene flow between recently diverged species is essential for understanding speciation processes. In parapatric populations, local adaptation is thought to be a major contributor to the evolution of reproductive isolation. However, extrinsic postzygotic barriers assessed in reciprocal transplant experiments are often neglected in empirical assessments of multiple isolation barriers. We analyzed multiple isolation barriers between two closely related species of the plant genus Dianthus, a genus characterized by the most rapid species diversification in plants reported so far. Although D. carthusianorum L. and D. sylvestris Wulf. can easily be hybridized in crossing experiments, natural hybrids are rare. We found that in parapatry, pollinator-mediated prezygotic reproductive isolation barriers are important for both D. carthusianorum (0.761) and D. sylvestris (0.468). In contrast to D. carthusianorum, high hybrid viability in D. sylvestris (-0.491) was counteracted by strong extrinsic postzygotic isolation (0.900). Our study highlights the importance of including reciprocal transplant experiments for documenting extrinsic postzygotic isolation and demonstrates clearly divergent strategies and hence asymmetric pre- and postzygotic reproductive isolation between closely related species. It also suggests that pollinator-mediated and ecological isolation could have interacted in synergistic ways, further stimulating rapid speciation in Dianthus.

Pollinators as isolation mechanisms: field observations and field experiments regarding specificity of pollinator attraction in the genus Ophrys (Orchidaceae und Insecta, Hymenoptera, Apoidea)	ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS			English	Article						pollination biology of deceptive orchids; Ophrys; species problems; pregame isolation mechanisms; pollinator specifity; Apoidea males as pollinators; experimental tests of species limitations	SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ODOR SIGNALS; CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION; SPECIES DELIMITATION; INTEGRATIVE TAXONOMY; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; SPHEGODES; SCENT	It is demonstrated that the biological species concept of the genus Ophrys corresponds to the general concepts of Ernst Mayr. On the example of two closely related forms of the fusca group in Andalucia, it is shown how to handle the different criteria of the biospecies concept. One is the high specifity of attraction of a male bee followed by a complex pseudocopulation behaviour which enables the correct pollen transfer within the species. The high specifity is caused by a highly remarkable imitation of the sexual pheromones of the mimicked female of the pollinator. Sexual pheromones of animals act as intraspecific signals which result in attractions of only males of the same species. Exactly this specific behaviour is triggered by the Ophrys flower, too. Thus the pollinator male is attracted only to those flowers which have the correct mixture of the pheromone molecules. To further ensure success the pollinating males also select other characters of the Ophrys flower as labellum size, colour, labellum hair characters, phenology and possibly habitat selections etc. In the sexual reproduction behaviour of the male insect acts as pregamic isolation mechanisms for the given Ophrys like for their own female. We were successful in confirming the high specifity of the pollination mechanisms in numerous field experiments, mainly choice experiments, this in contrast o the statements of Hennecke & Munzinger (2013). They had argued that there were many different pollinator species listed in the literature for a given Ophrys species. However, they did not critically assess the reliability of these citations. For this, they would have had to critically read the primary literature and not only the secondary quotations like in Delforge (2005, 2016) or others. Therefore, they rehashed many of the old mistakes concerning wrong identifications of the bees or even the Ophrys taxons which had long been corrected. Especially a mixture of old and actual names of the same species in different combinations is annoying and seems to demonstrate that the authors are not really fit in the nomenclature of Ophrys and their pollinators. This is demonstrated by some examples, which are very confusing without knowledge of the bees. For example, these authors did not realize that a 3-4 mm bee (Andrena hesperia) could not serve as a pollinator of a 20 mm labellum of a large Ophrys omegaifera species. However, there are some cases with more than one pollinator. Besides the main pollinator the others I call them "secondary pollinators" which in those cases we could check their pollination contribution in the population is very weak. In many cases, these secondary visitors are mainly pollinaria thieves because they are only attracted and try to copulate. However, they seem learn very quickly that Ophrys is not a true female and will never visit another flower of this kind. In some quantitative field experiments (with Eucera nigrescens/longicornis on Ophrys holosericea) we could confirm this hypothesis. The conclusion of the two authors that Ophrys species are not species-specific regarding sexual attractivity does not correspond to our field experiments regarding olfactory compound investigations in biotests, and does not agree with the molecular data of population biology and with the genetic analyses. The other proof the authors used in their argumentations are the supposed frequency of hybrids. But this is also a spurious argument. Hybrids are only frequent in literature and not in nature. In places frequently visited by orchid enthusiasts, the number of observed "hybrids" is conspicuously high, which may indicate "hand pollination". The aim of the two authors has been to reduce the many species within Ophrys because they cannot be discriminated. Consequently, they try to establish a simplified classification system without any biological background. A complete anthropomorphic typological systematic like the "Index of accepted plant names" is issued by Kew Gardens. However, this is in the 21st century, 150 years after Darwin, a kind of middle age taxonomy. They use a quite typological morphospecies concept like in the book of Pederson & Faurhold (2007). This does not fit with nature. If you pay attention to the different criteria of the biospecies concept within the genus Ophrys you will recognise the many species which the genus makes so interesting. A critical list of the known specific pollinators of the genus Ophrys is given as an appendix.

Induction by Chlorpyrifos, of the Confusion of Males in Discriminating Female Sexual Pheromones Used for Mate Finding by Two Sympatric Trichogramma Species (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						insecticide; parasitoid; T. evanescens; T. semblidis; sublethal effect	ASIAN CORN-BORER; CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PARASITOID WASP; ANTENNAL LOBE; DELTAMETHRIN; PESTICIDES; BEHAVIOR; IDENTIFICATION; INSECTICIDES	Chlorpyrifos is one of the most widely used insecticides worldwide. It has been shown to have deleterious effects on survival of nontarget insects, but its impact on behavior has received less attention. In this study, we investigated the sublethal effects of this insecticide on sexual pheromone discrimination in two Trichogramma species. In these species, sexual pheromones arrest partners belonging to the same species. This specificity is important for reproduction efficacy because interspecific matings are sterile. We used two sympatric and closely related species of Trichogramma to study how two doses (LD 20 and LD 0.1) of chlorpyrifos can alter the discrimination by males and the emission by females of pheromones from both species. When exposed to the LD 20, the males of both species showed a decrease in the discrimination of conspecific sexual pheromones. For one of the two species (T evanescens Westwood), this decrease even led to a total annihilation of discrimination. A dose as low as the LD 0.1, inducing no apparent mortality, induced the same decrease in pheromone discrimination for T semblidis Aurivillius males. However, no effect was observed on the discrimination by males of sexual pheromones emitted by females either exposed to an LD 20 or an LD 0.1 of chlorpyrifos. By decreasing the discrimination by males of sexual pheromones, chlorpyrifos may induce interspecific interactions and attempts at copulating that would decrease the fitness of parasitoids. The implications of these results in relation to environmental pollution, the mode of action of the insecticide and the status of natural enemy of Trichogramma are discussed.	[Delpuech, J.

Diversifying the geographical origins of a biocontrol agent species can be used to favour their perennial establishment by the sampling of pre-adapted genotypes and/or the production of new genotypes through hybridization. Hybridization can be nevertheless challenged by reproductive isolations induced by some common microbial endosymbionts. In this study, we aimed at characterizing (i) the genetic diversity of six populations of Psyttalia lounsburyi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a candidate biocontrol agent of the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Diptera: Tephritidae) and (ii) the diversity of their Wolbachia endosymbionts. Both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers evidence clustering between the South African population and several Kenyan/Namibian populations. The survey of the Wolbachia also distinguished two main variants with a spatial heterogeneity in the infection status. All these results are discussed in the context of the use of these P. lounsburyi populations for hybridization and further field releases.

These markers were used to investigate the genetic relationships, including reproductive isolation and host adaptation/specificity, in laboratory and field populations. Samples were collected from the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) and/or the nettle aphid, Microlophium carnosum (Buckton) in the UK and Bulgaria between 1991 and 1994. Whilst all loci discriminated between some species, PGM discriminated all five species, one species (A. eadyi) bearing two unique alleles (PGM(a) and PGM(c)). Aphidius microlophii (from nettle aphid) and A. ervi (from pea aphid), which are difficult to separate morphologically, possessed unique PGM alleles - PGM(b) and PGM(e), respectively. Both parasitoids occur sympatrically, and whilst hybrids heterozygous for PGM were produced in the laboratory (pGM(b,e)), such genotypes were not observed in the field populations sampled. Hence, the species appear to be reproductively isolated. Most parasitoid populations studied showed mean heterozygote deficiencies per locus (homozygote excess) compared with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. In particular, A. eadyi bearing PGM(a) alleles were always homozygous whilst additionally, many were homozygous for another allele, PGI(b). This is evidence for the existence of one or more morphologically-indistinguishable 'cryptic' species occurring sympatrically within European field populations. A dendrogram of relatedness was produced following calculation of Nei's genetic identity coefficient, I from the parasitoid population allele frequency data. All species showed very high similarity between populations at the intraspecific level (>0.9), but fewer interspecific similarities (0.23-0.63). These values compare well with previously published values for Aphidius populations and for other insects.

We revisited two puzzling features of Wolbachia biology: how Wolbachia can invade a new species and spread among populations, and how the association, once established in a host species, can evolve, with emphasis on the possible process of infection loss. These questions are particularly relevant in haplodiploid species, where males develop from unfertilized eggs, and females from fertilized eggs. When CI occurs in such species, fertilized eggs either die (female mortality type: FM), or develop into males (male development type: MD), raising one more question: how transition among CI types is possible. We reached the following conclusions: (1) the FM type is a better invader and should be retained preferentially after a new host is captured; (2) given the assumptions of the models, FM and MD types are selected on neither the bacterial side nor the host side; (3) selective pressures acting on both partners are more or less congruent in the FM type, but divergent in the MD type; (4) host and symbiont evolution can drive infection to extinction for all CI types, but the MD type is more susceptible to the phenomenon; and (5) under realistic conditions, transition from MD to FM type is possible. Finally, all these results suggest that the FM type should be more frequent than the MD type, which is consistent with the results obtained so far in haplodiploids.

The former species has geranylcitronellyl acetate as main component, plus in decreasing amounts geranylcitronellol, an eicosadienal, an eicosenol, and an eicosenal. Another 17 fatty acid derivatives are present in minor amounts. The labial secretion of P. vestalis differs distinctly in its chemistry from that of all of the 8 other Scandinavian Psithyrus species. In the taxonomically closely related (same subgenus) P. bohemicus, the labial gland secretion contains 16 fatty acid derivatives, of which 12 (75%) are present also in the secretion of P. vestalis. Thus, both the labial gland secretions, and morphological traits lend support to the hypothesis that the two species share a common ancestor. The reproductive isolation between them is, at least in part, supported by the inclusion of a second biosynthetical pathway (the mevalonic acid pathway producing terpenoids) in P. vestalis, in addition to the pathway common to both species (the polyketide pathway producing fatty acid derivatives).

Ecological Niche Models and Coalescent Analysis of Gene Flow Support Recent Allopatric Isolation of Parasitoid Wasp Populations in the Mediterranean	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIES DELIMITATION; EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION; MIGRATION RATES; NATURAL ENEMIES; DIVERGENCE; CONSERVATISM; MITOCHONDRIAL; HYMENOPTERA	Background: The integration of multiple complementary approaches is a powerful way to understand the processes of diversification and speciation. The parasitoid wasp Aphidius transcaspicus Telenga (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a parasitoid of Hyalopterus aphids across a wide geographic range. This species shows a remarkable degree of genetic structure among western, central, and eastern Mediterranean population clusters. In this paper we attempt to better characterize this genetic structure. Methodology/Principal Findings: We use a Bayesian coalescent analysis of gene flow under the Isolation with Migration model using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers together with climate- based ecological niche models to better understand the genetic structure of A. transcaspicus in the Mediterranean. The coalescent analysis revealed low levels of migration among western and eastern Mediterranean populations (Nm < 1) that were not statistically distinguishable from zero. Niche models showed that localities within population clusters each occupy areas of continuously high environmental suitability, but are separated from each other by large regions of completely unsuitable habitat that could limit dispersal. Overall, environmental characteristics were similar among the population clusters, though significant differences did emerge. Conclusions/Significance: These results support contemporary allopatric isolation of Mediterranean populations of A. transcaspicus, which together with previous analyses indicating partial behaviorally mediated reproductive isolation, suggest that the early stages of cryptic speciation may be in progress.

Previous general surveys of insects in Panama and Britain found Wolbachia to be common, occurring in 16-22% of species. Here, using similar polymerase chain reaction methods, we report that 19.3% of a sample of temperate North American insects are infected with Wolbachia, we frequency strikingly similar to frequencies found in two other studies in widely separated locales. The results may indicate a widespread equilibrium of Wolbachia infection frequencies in insects whose maintenance remains to be explained. Alternatively, Wolbachia may be increasing in global insect communities. Within each of the three geographic regions surveyed, Hymenoptera are more frequently infected with A group Wolbachia and Lepidoptera more frequently infected with B group Wolbachia.

But how likely is it that a new altruistic mutation will satisfy Hamilton's rule by increasing the reproductive efficiency of the group? Altruism per se does not improve efficiency, and hence we would not expect a typical altruistic mutation to increase the mean productivity of the population. We examined the conditions under which a mutation causing reproductive altruism can spread when it does not increase productivity. We considered a population divided into temporary groups of genetically similar individuals (typically family groups). We show that the spread of altruism requires a pleiotropic link between altruism and enhanced productivity in diploid organisms, but not in haplodiploid organisms such as Hymenoptera. This result provides a novel biological understanding of the barrier to the spread of reproductive altruism in diploids. In haplodiploid organisms, altruism within families that lowers productivity may spread, provided daughters sacrifice their own reproduction to raise full-sisters. We verified our results using three single-locus genetic models that explore a range of the possible reproductive costs of helping. The advantage of female-to-female altruism in haplodiploids is a well-known prediction of Hamilton's rule, but its importance in relaxing the linkage between altruism and efficiency has not been explored. We discuss the possible role of such unproductive altruism in the origins of sociality.

Breakdown of species boundaries in Mandevilla: floral morphological intermediacy, novel fragrances and asymmetric pollen flow	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Apocynaceae; floral fragrances; geometric morphometry; Mandevilla; phenotypic intermediacy; pollination	POLLINATION SYNDROMES; GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; COROLLA SHAPE; HYBRIDIZATION; PATTERNS; SCENT; PLANT; APOCYNACEAE; ADAPTATION	Phenotypic intermediacy is an indicator of putative hybrid origin and has provided the main clues to discovering hybrid plants in nature. Mandevilla pentlandiana and M. laxa (Apocynaceae) are sister species with clear differences in floral phenotype and associated pollinator guilds: diurnal Hymenoptera and nocturnal hawkmoths, respectively. The presence of individuals with intermediate phenotypes in a wild population raises questions about the roles of visual and olfactory signals (i.e. corolla morphology and floral fragrances) as barriers to interbreeding, and how the breakdown of floral isolation occurs. We examined phenotypic variation in a mixed Mandevilla population, analysing the chemical composition of floral fragrances, characterising floral shape through geometric morphometrics and assessing individual grouping through taxonomically relevant traits and an unsupervised learning algorithm. We quantified the visitation frequencies of floral visitors and tracked their foraging movements using pollen analogues. The presence of morphologically intermediate individuals and pollen analogue movement suggested extensive hybridisation between M. laxa and M. pentlandiana, along with asymmetrical rates of backcrossing between these putative hybrids and M. laxa. Floral volatiles from putative hybrid individuals showed a transgressive phenotype, with additional compounds not emitted by either parental species. Our results suggest the presence of a hybrid swarm between sympatric M. pentlandiana and M. laxa and indicate that initial hybridisation events between these parental species are rare, but once they occur, visits between putative hybrids and M. laxa are common and facilitate continued introgression.

In mixed populations in the laboratory, the SEL biotype was heavily favored, irrespective of pesticide treatment suggesting a high degree of laboratory adaptation. The resistance levels in untreated and pesticide-treated mixed (SEL + RB) populations were not different after eight generations. Analyses of RAPD-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data suggested that the selective advantage of the SEL biotype may have been aided by a partial mating incompatibility between the biotypes. The data can be explained by either of two types of reproductive incompatibility: (1) RB females mating with SEL males produced only male offspring; or (2) the RB biotype could not successfully find mates under laboratory conditions. Successful discrimination of T. pallidus biotypes and their hybrid progeny in population cages suggests that RAPD-PCR offers a method to determine the fate of the pesticide-resistant SEL biotype after release into orchards populated by the RB biotype.

Thus, the genetic improvement of biocontrol agents could enhance the efficiency of biocontrol programs. Although promising, this approach has rarely been applied in this field. At the intraspecific level, hybridization between divergent populations of biocontrol agents is expected to promote hybrid vigor (heterosis), but it is not clear to what extent. An even more difficult task is the ability to predict the fitness of hybrids from the biological characteristics of their parents. We investigated these general questions by crossing seven populations of the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonis (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). Our results show different levels of mating compatibilities among populations, including asymmetric or almost complete reproductive isolation. Hybrids' performance (fitness of the F 1 generation) ranges from inbreeding depression to heterosis. It was possible, to some extent, to predict hybrid fitness from pairwise genetic and phenotypic distances among parents, in accordance with the dominance hypothesis. This may provide general guidelines for the genetic improvement of biological control agents.

Why Variation in Flower Color May Help Reproductive Success in the Endangered Australian Orchid Caladenia fulva	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						orchid; endangered; flower color; pollination; Hymenoptera; fruit set; DNA analysis	FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; LADYS-SLIPPER ORCHID; FRUIT PRODUCTION; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; POLLINATOR; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; L.; CHILOGLOTTIS	Caladenia fulva G.W. Carr (Tawny Spider-orchid) is a terrestrial Australian endangered orchid confined to contiguous reserves in open woodland in Victoria, Australia. Natural recruitment is poor and no confirmed pollinator has been observed in the last 30 years. Polymorphic variation in flower color complicates plans for artificial pollination, seed collection and ex situ propagation for augmentation or re-introduction. DNA sequencing showed that there was no distinction among color variants in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the chloroplast trnT-trnF and matK regions. Also, authentic specimens of both C. fulva and Caladenia reticulata from the reserves clustered along with these variants, suggesting free interbreeding. Artificial cross-pollination in situ and assessment of seed viability further suggested that no fertility barriers existed among color variants. Natural fruit set was 15% of the population and was proportional to numbers of the different flower colors but varied with orchid patch within the population. Color modeling on spectral data suggested that a hymenopteran pollinator could discriminate visually among color variants. The similarity in fruiting success, however, suggests that flower color polymorphism may avoid pollinator habituation to specific non-rewarding flower colors. The retention of large brightly colored flowers suggests that C. fulva has maintained attractiveness to foraging insects rather than evolving to match a scarce unreliable hymenopteran sexual pollinator. These results suggest that C. fulva should be recognized as encompassing plants with these multiple flower colors, and artificial pollination should use all variants to conserve the biodiversity of the extant population.

A prominent example of such variation in the highly eusocial Hymenoptera is differences in the number of reproductive queens per colony, Differences in queen number in ants are associated with differences in a host of reproductive and social traits, including queen phenotype and breeding strategy, mode of colony reproduction, and pattern of sex allocation. We examine the causes and consequences of changes in colony queen number and associated traits using the fire ant Solenopsis invicta as a principal model. Ecological constraints on mode of colony founding may act as important selective forces causing the evolution of queen number in this and many other ants, with social organization generally perpetuated across generations by means of the social environment molding appropriate queen phenotypes and reproductive strategies. Shifts in colony queen number have profound effects on genetic structure within nests and may also influence genetic structure at higher levels (aggregations of nests or local demes) because of the association of queen number with particular mating and dispersal habits. Divergence of breeding habits between populations with different social organizations has the potential to promote genetic differentiation between these social variants. Thus, evolution of social organization can be important in generating intrinsic selective regimes that channel subsequent social evolution and in initiating the development of significant population genetic structure, including barriers to gene flow important in cladogenesis.

Novel microsatellite DNA markers indicate strict parthenogenesis and few genotypes in the invasive willow sawfly Nematus oligospilus	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						microsatellite isolation; cross-amplification; invasive species; asexual reproduction; Tenthredinidae	EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS; TENTHREDINIDAE HYMENOPTERA; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FORSTER HYMENOPTERA; MYZUS-PERSICAE; BOTTOM-UP; AMPLIFICATION; INSECT; APHIDS; DIVERSE	Invasive organisms can have major impacts on the environment. Some invasive organisms are parthenogenetic in their invasive range and, therefore, exist as a number of asexual lineages (=clones). Determining the reproductive mode of invasive species has important implications for understanding the evolutionary genetics of such species, more especially, for management-relevant traits. The willow sawfly Nematus oligospilus Forster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) has been introduced unintentionally into several countries in the Southern Hemisphere where it has subsequently become invasive. To assess the population expansion, reproductive mode and host-plant relationships of this insect, microsatellite markers were developed and applied to natural populations sampled from the native and expanded range, along with sequencing of the cytochrome-oxidase I mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) region. Other tenthredinids across a spectrum of taxonomic similarity to N. oligospilus and having a range of life strategies were also tested. Strict parthenogenesis was apparent within invasive N. oligospilus populations throughout the Southern Hemisphere, which comprised only a small number of genotypes. Sequences of mtDNA were identical for all individuals tested in the invasive range. The microsatellite markers were used successfully in several sawfly species, especially Nematus spp. and other genera of the Nematini tribe, with the degree of success inversely related to genetic divergence as estimated from COI sequences. The confirmation of parthenogenetic reproduction in N. oligospilus and the fact that it has a very limited pool of genotypes have important implications for understanding and managing this species and its biology, including in terms of phenotypic diversity, host relationships, implications for spread and future adaptive change. It would appear to be an excellent model study system for understanding evolution of invasive parthenogens that diverge without sexual reproduction and genetic recombination.

Mechanisms of prezygotic reproductive isolation between two sympatric species, Gelsemium rankinii and G. sempervirens (Gelsemiaceae), in the southeastern United States	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						floral isolation; Gelsemiaceae; Gelsemitim; hybridization; prezygotic reproductive isolation; sympatry; temporal isolation	HABROPODA-LABORIOSA HYMENOPTERA; NATURAL HYBRIDIZATION; POLLINATION SYNDROMES; MORPHOLOGY; VACCINIUM; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; BIOLOGY; SPECIATION; BLUEBERRY	Natural hybridization plays a critical role in speciation, the maintenance of reproductive isolation, and genetic introgression. While many plant species have hybrid swarms in areas of sympatry, the lack of hybrids among closely related sympatrically distributed species suggests that strong pre- and/or postzygotic barriers exist to hybridization. Gelsemium sempervirens and G. rankinii (Gelsemiaceae) are sympatrically distributed southeastern sister taxa that have strong postzygotic barriers to hybrid formation and high levels of genetic differentiation. In this study, two sympatric populations in Lowndes County, Georgia were surveyed from 1999-2005 to assess the role of temporal and pollinator isolation as potential prezygotic barriers. The populations had mostly non-overlapping flowering periods in 2003-2005, with significant differences in time of peak flowering and length of flowering. Both species shared a similar community of flower visitors, with the apid bee Habropoda laboriosa the dominant visitor to both species. A choice experiment found that H. laboriosa visited both species but preferred G. sempervirens. The primary prezygotic barrier is temporal isolation preventing hybridization in spite of the shared pollinators. This study suggests that reliance on a shared pollinator during speciation may limit opportunity for divergent selection on flowering time.

However, factors such as the presence of multiple reproductive queens (polygyny), multiple queen matings (polyandry) or worker reproduction result in decreased relatedness among workers and the brood they rear, and consequently dilute their inclusive fitness benefits from helping. Here, we investigated population genetic structure, mating system, worker reproduction and parthenogenesis in the desert ant Cataglyphis sabulosa. Analysis of worker genotypes showed that colonies are headed by a single queen, mated with 1-5 males. The inbreeding coefficient within colonies and the levels of relatedness between the queens and their mates were positive, indicating that mating occurs between related individuals. Moreover, the mates of a queen are on average related and contribute equally to worker production. Our analyses also indicate that colonies are genetically differentiated and form a population exhibiting no isolation-by-distance pattern, consistent with the independent foundation of new colonies (that is, without the help of workers). Finally, both ovarian dissections and genetic data on the parentage of males show that workers do not reproduce in queenright colonies; however, they lay both haploid (arrhenotokous males) and diploid (thelytokous females) eggs in queenless colonies. In contrast to the congeneric species C. cursor, where new queens are produced by thelytokous parthenogenesis, female sexuals of C. sabulosa result from classical sexual reproduction.

However, several studies have uncovered decreased relatedness values within colonies, resulting primarily from multiple queen matings (polyandry) and/or from the presence of more than one functional queen (polygyny). Here, we report on the use of microsatellite data for the investigation of sociogenetic parameters, such as relatedness, and levels of polygyny and polyandry, in the ant Pheidole pallidula . We demonstrate, through analysis of mother-offspring combinations and the use of direct sperm typing, that each queen is inseminated by a single male. The inbreeding coefficient within colonies and the levels of relatedness between the queens and their mate are not significantly different from zero, indicating that matings occur between unrelated individuals. Analyses of worker genotypes demonstrate that 38% of the colonies are polygynous with 2-4 functional queens, and suggest the existence of reproductive skew, i.e. unequal respective contribution of queens to reproduction. Finally, our analyses indicate that colonies are genetically differentiated and form a population exhibiting significant isolation-by-distance, suggesting that some colonies originate through budding.

From 2014-2015, 116 experimental D. citri cohorts were monitored to determine survivorship, life table parameters, and marginal rates of mortality of immature D. citri at three sites in Riverside County, CA. D. citri cohorts of similar to 200 eggs were established on potted Citrus volkameriana (Rutaceae) plants. Field deployed cohorts were protected with fine or coarse mesh enclosures, sticky barriers, or left unprotected. Egg through adult emergence rates were used to assess the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors on psyllid survivorship rates by life stage. Predation of immature D. citri by larvae of Allograpta sp. (Diptera: Syrphidae) and Chrysoperla sp. (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) comprised 86% of all observed predation mortality. When protected from all other arthropods, parasitism by Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) comprised 21% of the total marginal rate of immature D. citri mortality from September to November in 2014 and 2015. Overall, D. citri net reproductive rates were reduced by 55-95% when exposed to natural enemies, indicating the importance of the classical biological control agent, T. radiata, and generalist predators in reducing D. citri densities in urban areas of southern California.

We examined geographic structure in the searching behaviour of a recently discovered parasitoid in the genus Agathis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) by examining the pattern of population structure obtained from sequence data of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I and the pattern of population differentiation in female searching behaviour. Analyses of population structure showed no isolation by distance and suggested long distance dispersal among populations. This pattern is consistent with recent post-glacial expansion of Agathis n. sp. Observations of searching behaviour demonstrated that populations of Agathis n. sp. differed in a subset of the behavioural traits examined and also one morphological trait. These population differences appear to be driven in part by local host plant characteristics. and based on the population structure of Agathis n. sp., have arisen relatively quickly in evolutionary time. This study suggests that the interaction between parasitoids and their host insects may exhibit substantial geographic variation, and studies that focus at the level of single populations or the species-level may be missing much of the evolutionary dynamics of parasitoid-host interactions.

Two mitochondrial genes [cytochrome oxidase subunits I (COI) and II (COII)] and the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) of several individuals per population were sequenced. G. morrilli populations from Texas (TX), Florida (FL), California (CA), and an outgroup (G. ashmeadi) were analyzed. For comparison, a population from Argentina (G. annulicornis) morphologically similar to G. morrilli was also included. For all three sequence fragments, percentage sequence divergence (%D) demonstrated that both the TX and FL populations (TX/FL) were closely related and therefore determined to be the same species; in contrast, the %D between TX/FL and CA fell within the range of the outgroup, making the CA population a new species or sp. n. Neighbor-joining distance trees also clustered the TX/FL and CA populations or species into two well supported distinctive clades. The near G. morrilli sp. n. was more closely related to G. annulicornis than to the TX/FL species. Mating studies demonstrated that the populations or species from CA and TX were reproductively incompatible, producing no female offspring in both direct and reciprocal crosses; whereas, the heterogamic crosses between TX and FL produced fertile offspring and relative compatibility indices similar to the homogamic crosses. Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility was ruled out as a cause for the lack of reproduction since both males and females were infected in equal portions with Wolbachia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to diploid-tetraploid complexes, hybridization between diploid and hexaploid individuals may lead to viable fertile tetraploid offspring, and thus the interactions between these ploidy levels can be more complex. We investigated the breeding barriers operating between diploid and hexaploid individuals of Aster amellus at a contact zone in Central Europe to understand the absence of hybrids (i.e., tetraploids) and mixed populations. Phenological segregation, assortative mating mediated by pollinators and crossing ability were assessed under natural and controlled conditions in diploid and hexaploid populations growing in close proximity. The results revealed low levels of reproductive isolation (RI) due to flowering phenology (RI = 11-45%) and pollinator behavior (RI = 17%), so that pollen transfer between diploids and hexaploids is possible. In contrast, almost complete reproductive isolation was observed due to a series of post-pollination barriers that significantly reduced the production of offspring from inter-cytotype crosses (RI = 99.9%), even though some tetraploids were detected in seeds and seedlings. We conclude that the absence of tetraploids at the contact zone is probably due to a combination of several factors, including spatial segregation, strong post-pollination barriers (such as gametic isolation, low viability of tetraploid seeds and/or inability of tetraploid plants to reach the flowering stage), and to a lesser extent, temporal and behavioral segregation. Future studies should explore the fitness of tetraploids and the effect of different traits on the reproductive success and fitness of each cytotype. This will enable a fuller understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms acting in contact zones.

High numbers of unrelated reproductives in the Australian 'higher' termite Nasutitermes exitiosus (Blattodea: Termitidae)	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Pleometrosis; Colony fusion; Social insect; Population genetics	ISOPTERA RHINOTERMITIDAE; COLONY STRUCTURE; RELATEDNESS; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; SOFTWARE; CORNIGER; POLYGYNY; BIOLOGY; FUSION	Social insect colonies are among the most complex social organisations in nature, with reproductive and non-reproductive individuals co-ordinating to maintain the survival of the colony. Multiple reproductive schemes occur in social insects, from simple schemes with one founding reproductive pair, to more complex ones involving within-colony inbreeding and more than two unrelated reproductives. Colony breeding schemes and genetic structure remain understudied in termites, compared to the Hymenoptera. In this study, we performed the first genetic characterisation of the colony breeding structure of Nasutitermes exitiosus (Blattodea: Termitidae), an endemic Australian termite with a broad distribution across southern mainland Australia. We analysed the genetic structure of 60 N. exitiosus colonies from the Eastern part of its distribution, using microsatellites and mitochondrial sequence data. We found that most colonies were headed by one founding pair of reproductives, although some colonies exhibited a more complex breeding structure, including within-colony inbreeding and the presence of multiple unrelated reproductives. We found evidence for the presence of seven unrelated queens in one colony, to our knowledge, the highest number of unrelated queens yet found in a termite from the family Termitidae. We found some evidence for genetic isolation by distance, indicating that the species is a relatively poor disperser over long ranges.	[Montagu, A.; Lee, T. R.

Low parasitism rates in parthenogenetic bagworm moths do not support the parasitoid hypothesis for sex	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						asexual; barcoding; Dahlica; Hymenoptera; insect phenology; Naryciinae; parasites; Psychidae; Red Queen hypothesis; Siederia	FRESH-WATER SNAIL; RED-QUEEN; DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; SPECIES LEPIDOPTERA; EVOLUTION; MAINTENANCE; REPRODUCTION; RECOMBINATION; PSYCHIDAE	The parasite hypothesis for sex is one of the many theories that have been suggested to solve the mystery of the widespread occurrence of sex despite its high short-term costs. It suggests that sexual lineages have an evolutionary advantage over parthenogens because they can frequently generate new genotypes that are temporarily less prone to coevolving parasites. In this study, we looked for further supporting evidence for the parasite hypothesis of sex in an attempt to understand the coexistence of sexual and parthenogenetic bagworm moths (Naryciinae). The bagworm moths and their parasitoids form one of the few natural hostparasite systems where sexual and parthenogenetic hosts are apparently not separated by ecological or geographical barriers. Furthermore, in support of the parasite hypothesis for sex, parthenogenetic presence is negatively correlated with parasitism rate. We specifically tested, by identifying the reproductive mode of the parasitized individuals, whether parasitoids preferentially attack the parthenogens in sites with both sexual and parthenogenetic forms, as predicted by the parasite hypothesis. We collected hosts from sites with different frequencies of parthenogenetic and sexual moths. A DNA barcoding approach was used to determine the reproductive mode of the parasitized hosts. Furthermore, we investigated whether differences in host and parasitoid phenology could provide an alternative explanation for the variation in parasitism rates between parthenogens and sexuals. Our results contradict the prediction of the parasite hypothesis because parthenogenetic bagworm moths were less parasitized than sexuals in sympatric sites. Our findings can be explained by differences in phenology between the parthenogenetic and sexual moths rather than genetic incompatibility between parthenogenetic hosts and parasitoids. The stable coexistence of sexual and parthenogenetic Naryciinae despite the many apparent costs of sex in this system remains a mystery. Our work adds to the list of studies were the assumptions of the parasite hypothesis for sex are not all met.	[Elzinga, J.

While numerous examples of host-associated differentiation (HAD) have been found, the overall importance of HAD in insect diversification remains unclear, as few studies have investigated its frequency in relation to all speciation events. One promising way to infer the prevalence and repeatability of HAD is to estimate genetic differentiation in multiple insect taxa that use the same set of hosts. To this end, we measured and compared variation in mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS2 sequences in population samples of leaf-galling Pontania and bud-galling Euura sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) collected from six Salix species in two replicate locations in northern Fennoscandia. We found evidence of frequent HAD in both species complexes, as individuals from the same willow species tended to cluster together on both mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenetic trees. Although few fixed differences among the putative species were found, hierarchical AMOVAs showed that most of the genetic variation in the samples was explained by host species rather than by sampling location. Nevertheless, the levels of HAD measured across specific pairs of host species were not correlated in the two focal galler groups. Hence, our results support the hypothesis of HAD as a central force in herbivore speciation, but also indicate that evolutionary trajectories are only weakly repeatable even in temporally overlapping radiations of related insect taxa.

The Reproductive Ecology of Diploid and Tetraploid Galax urceolata	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							HABITAT DIFFERENTIATION; POLYPLOIDY; AUTOPOLYPLOIDY; DIAPENSIACEAE; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; ORIGINS	Polyploidy is common in nature, particularly among plants, and is often associated with significant morphological, ecological, and evolutionary change. These changes may contribute to prezygotic and postzygotic isolation between cytotypes; therefore, polyploidy is commonly thought to lead to speciation. Recent work suggests prezygotic mechanisms may be more important in determining isolation than postzygotic mechanisms. We compared the reproductive ecology of populations of diploid and tetraploid Galax to assess the potential for gene flow between the cytotypes. Galax urceolata is native to the southern Appalachian Mountains and is a natural polyploid series with diploid, triploid, and autotetraploid individuals occurring in uniform and mixed-cytotype populations. We found the temporal peak of flower production in tetraploids slightly preceded that of diploids; however, the overall distributions of flowering phenologies were similar. Hymenoptera and Diptera were the most common floral visitors and diploids were visited slightly more often than tetraploids; however, there were no differences between cytotypes in terms of the taxonomic composition of their floral visitors. Seed production is likely pollen limited, but again this does not differ between cytotypes. While tetraploids produced more flowers than diploids, there was no difference in fruit production. Finally, our data suggest that Galax urceolata is self-incompatible. In sum we found few differences in the reproductive ecology of diploid and tetraploid Galax, which when combined with obligate outcrossing increases the potential for gene flow between cytotypes and reduces the likelihood of differentiation.

J	Shoemaker, DD; Ross, KG				Shoemaker, DD; Ross, KG			Effects of social organization on gene flow in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta	NATURE			English	Article							ALTERNATIVE ADAPTATIONS; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; HYMENOPTERA; FORMICIDAE; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; INSECTS; QUEENS; COMPETITION; COLONIES	A CONTROVERSIAL model of speciation proposes that the development of alternative social organizations within populations of group-living animals may drive the inception of reproductive isolation(1-3). The alternative social behaviours, which are selectively favoured in some social or ecological contexts, may be correlated with distinctive reproductive traits such that significant barriers to interbreeding emerge between coexisting social variants. Evidence for this mode of speciation is almost non-existent(3-8), but it provides one of the most compelling mechanisms for sympatric sepciation(3,8) and could conceivably explain many species origins. Here we examine variation in mitochondrial DNA and two unique nuclear genes to demonstrate that gene flow between sympatric social forms of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta is restricted to only one of four possible routes. The loss of the other routes results from incompatibilities in the social systems of the two forms, demonstrating the potential for social selection to generate significant barriers to gene flow and to initiate reproductive isolation.

Thelytoky in the honey bee	APIDOLOGIE			English	Review						Apis mellifera; Apis mellifera capensis; asexual; thelytoky; reproductive parasitism	APIS-MELLIFERA-CAPENSIS; WORKER REPRODUCTION; SOCIAL PARASITISM; CLONAL REPRODUCTION; SCUTELLATA COLONIES; GENETIC DIVERSITY; LAYING WORKERS; CENTRAL FUSION; LINKAGE MAP; PARTHENOGENESIS	Thelytoky, the asexual production of females, is rare in honey bees. However, it is ubiquitous in workers of the Cape honey bee Apis mellifera capensis. Thelytoky allows some workers to be reincarnated into the queen phenotype, and thereby selects for reproductive competition among workers. Thelytoky also acts as an exaptation for the emergence of reproductive parasites, the most extreme example of which is an entirely clonal 'cancerous' lineage of workers (the Clone) that lethally parasitises colonies of another subspecies Apis mellifera scutellata. The Clone is an enigma because thelytoky results in the accumulation of homozygosity at any loci that are free to recombine, yet the Clone retains considerable heterozygosity. The Clone pays a cost for its thelytoky: the selective removal of homozygous offspring at each generation. We propose that workers, queens and Clones have differing abilities to endure the costs and benefits of sex and asexuality, accounting for the heterogeneous distribution of reproductive strategies across the A. mellifera capensis population. We further suggest that multiple factors must fall into place for thelytoky to emerge as an effective reproductive strategy in a honey bee population, and that geographic isolation resulting in genetic drift and founder effects may have enabled thelytoky to emerge in A. mellifera capensis. Finally, we consider the honey bee in the broader context of haplodiploid Hymenoptera, and argue that constraints on the evolution of sex in non-haplodiploid taxa may make sexual reproduction an evolutionary 'one-way street'.

The Parasitic Wasp, Cotesia congregata (Say), Consists of Two Incipient Species Isolated by Asymmetric Reproductive Incompatibility and Hybrid Inability to Overcome Host Defenses	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						polydnavirus; bracovirus; hybrid dysgenesis; host expression; host-associated differentiation; reproductive isolation; speciation; virulence	FOODPLANT COMPLEX SOURCES; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENT; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; HYMENOPTERA-BRACONIDAE; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; HEMOCYTE INACTIVATION; SESAMIAE HYMENOPTERA; POLYDNAVIRUS GENE; BUSSEOLA-FUSCA; DYSGENESIS	Parasitic wasps are highly diverse and play a major role in suppression of herbivorous insect pest populations. Several previously identified species of parasitic wasps have been found to be complexes of cryptic species resulting from adaptations to specific hosts or host foodplants. Cotesia congregata (Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which has long served as a model system for host-parasitoid interactions, can be used for investigating the process of diversification among sympatric populations that differ in host and host foodplant usage. Two incipient species of C. congregata have been identified in the USA mid-Atlantic region, "MsT wasps" originate from Manduca sexta (L.) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on tobacco and "CcC wasps" originate from Ceratomia catalpae (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on catalpa. Both wasp sources can develop in either host species. Hybrids resulting from MsT male xCcC female crosses are fertile, whereas hybrids from CcC male xMsT female crosses are typically sterile. In this study, we compared relative expression in vivo of seven C. congregata bracovirus (CcBV) genes among MsT and CcC parental and hybrid crosses. Also, we established hybrid crosses between MsT and CcC wasps and four additional host foodplant sources of C. congregata. Patterns of relative expression in vivo of MsT and CcC CcBV genes differed; a few were not expressed in hosts parasitized by CcC wasps. Overall, relative expression of CcBV genes from MsT and CcC wasps did not differ with respect to the host species parasitized. Low or absent expression of CcBV genes was found in hosts parasitized by sterile hybrids. For the most part, the other four host-foodplant wasp sources were reproductively compatible with either MsT or CcC wasps and hybrid crosses with the alternative wasp source were asymmetrically sterile. Crosses involving CcC males or MsT females produced sterile hybrids that lacked mature ovaries. Cumulatively, results indicate that C. congregata is composed of two sympatric incipient species that can utilize multiple host species rather than several host-associated races or cryptic species.

Behaviour of sexually deceived ichneumonid wasps and its implications for pollination in Cryptostylis (Orchidaceae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						Cryptostylis ovata; Lissopimpla excelsa; mark-recapture; pollen dispersal; pollination; pollinator learning; sexual deception	ROBORATOR F HYMENOPTERA; DECEPTIVE ORCHID; CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; OPHRYS-SPHEGODES; EVOLUTION; SPECIFICITY; CHEMISTRY; ECOLOGY	Pollination via sexual deception is hypothesised to be associated with more frequent outcrossing and greater pollen dispersal distances than strategies involving food-foraging behaviour. In this study, we investigated the behaviour and movement distances of Lissopimpla excelsa (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), and their implications for the pollination of the sexually deceptive Cryptostylis ovata (Orchidaceae). Pollinator observations revealed that while L. excelsa will alight on multiple flowers within a single visit to a patch of orchids, the frequency of attempted copulation decreases with successive visits, suggesting that pollinator learning may inhibit within-patch pollen transfer. Mark-recapture demonstrated that 25% of wasps revisited inflorescences within a day and 50% revisited within a week. Despite the apparent site fidelity of some individuals, L. excelsa often move over large distances (maximum = 625 m), and are capable of dispersing pollen between patches. To resolve the consequences of pollination by sexual deception of ichneumonids, we compared our results with those from studies of other sexually deceptive systems. While pollination rates were comparable with other sexually deceptive orchids, L. excelsa showed high rates of column contact and moved over large distances relative to other sexually deceived pollinators. Among sexually deceptive orchids in general, the frequency of column contact was not correlated either with the frequency of pseudocopulation or with pollination rate. These results suggest that the consequences of pollination by sexual deception may vary extensively between plant taxa due to variation in floral traits, and behavioural differences between pollinator groups.

EVIDENCE FROM BREEDING STUDIES	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article								Breeding studies reconfirmed the hybridization between Sida ovata Forssk., and Sida tiagii Bhandari. All the three taxa i.e., S. ovata Forssk., S. tiagii Bhandari and the hybrid are facultative autogamous as indicated by pollen - ovule ratios and breeding experiments. Chrysis sp., (Hymenoptera) seems to be responsible for pollen transfer between S. ovata and S. tiagii in natural populations. Certain insect pollinators were specific such as Bembix sp., and Bombus sp., for S. ovata, Apis sp., and Vespa sp., for S. tiagii and Ponera sp., for the hybrid. The limited number of hybrids may be due to less frequent visitation of common pollinator (Chrysis sp.) alongwith the incomplete reproductive barrier between both the parents. The restricted gene now is also evident by least fruit and seed set in hand pollinated reciprocal crosses of the putative parents as compared to the self pollination. It seems that back crosses are impeded due to the absence of common pollinators between the parents and hybrid and meiotic irregularities as indicated by the failure of hand pollinated (back crosses) experiments.

Oviposition traits generate extrinsic postzygotic isolation between two pine sawfly species	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Ecological speciation; Reproductive barriers; Host adaptation; Phytophagous insect; Diprionidae; Neodiprion	DEPENDENT POSTMATING ISOLATION; GENUS NEODIPRION HYMENOPTERA; HOST RACE FORMATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; MITOCHONDRIAL INTROGRESSION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; DIPRIONIDAE; INSECTS	Background: Although empirical data indicate that ecological speciation is prevalent in nature, the relative importance of different forms of reproductive isolation and the traits generating reproductive isolation remain unclear. To address these questions, we examined a pair of ecologically divergent pine-sawfly species: while Neodiprion pinetum specializes on a thin-needled pine (Pinus strobus), N. lecontei utilizes thicker-needled pines. We hypothesized that extrinsic postzygotic isolation is generated by oviposition traits. To test this hypothesis, we assayed ovipositor morphology, oviposition behavior, and host-dependent oviposition success in both species and in F1 and backcross females. Results: Compared to N. lecontei, N. pinetum females preferred P. strobus more strongly, had smaller ovipositors, and laid fewer eggs per needle. Additionally, we observed host-and trait-dependent reductions in oviposition success in F1 and backcross females. Hybrid females that had pinetum-like host preference (P. strobus) and lecontei-like oviposition traits (morphology and egg pattern) fared especially poorly. Conclusions: Together, these data indicate that maladaptive combinations of oviposition traits in hybrids contribute to extrinsic postzygotic isolation between N. lecontei and N. pinetum, suggesting that oviposition traits may be an important driver of divergence in phytophagous insects.

The two host range groups were poorly distinguishable by means of morphological characters. In contrast, isoelectric focusing proved to be a much better tool for discrimination. Reproductive isolation between the two host range groups was clear but not complete, as evidenced by crossing experiments with laboratory-bred and field-collected material. Under field conditions, males showed a specific response to virgin females of the two groups. Hence, the sex pheromones of the females were obviously different. Considering these results, a species (Aphidius sp. A) closely related to A. rhopalosiphi seems to occur. As a detailed study of morphological characters is still lacking, aphidius sp. A is not yet formally established here. Due to its dependence upon Sitobion spp., Aphidius sp. A may be an economically important parasitoid of the pest aphid S. avenae.

Pollination by long-tongued anthophorine bees foraging for nectar and coincidentally acquiring pollen on some part of their bodies is the inferred ancestral pollination strategy for most genera of the large subfamilies Iridoideae and Crocoideae and may be ancestral for the latter. Derived strategies include pollination by long-proboscid flies, large butterflies, night-flying hovering and settling moths, hopliine beetles and sunbirds. Bee pollination is diverse, with active pollen collection by female bees occurring in several genera, vibratile systems in a few and non-volatile oil as a reward in one species. Long-proboscid fly pollination, which is apparently restricted to southern Africa, includes four separate syndromes using different sets of flies and plant species in different parts of the subcontinent. Small numbers of species use bibionid flies, short-proboscid flies or wasps for their pollination; only about 2 % of species use multiple pollinators and can be described as generalists. center dot Scope Using pollination observations for 375 species and based on repeated patterns of floral attractants and rewards, we infer pollination mechanisms for an additional 610 species. Matching pollination system to phylogeny or what is known about species relationships based on shared derived features, we infer repeated shifts in pollination system in some genera, as frequently as one shift for every five or six species of southern African Babiana or Gladiolus. Specialized systems using pollinators of one pollination group, or even a single pollinator species are the rule in the family. Shifts in pollination system are more frequent in genera of Crocoideae that have bilaterally symmetric flowers and a perianth tube, features that promote adaptive radiation by facilitating precise shifts in pollen placement, in conjunction with changes in flower colour, scent and tube length. center dot Conclusions Diversity of pollination systems explains in part the huge species diversity of Iridaceae in sub-Saharan Africa, and permits species packing locally. Pollination shifts are, however, seen as playing a secondary role in speciation by promoting reproductive isolation in peripheral, ecologically distinct populations in areas of diverse topography, climate and soils. Pollination of Iridaceae in Eurasia and the New World, where the family is also well represented, is poorly studied but appears less diverse, although pollination by both pollen- and oil-collecting bees is frequent and bird pollination rare.

Pollinator isolation in Louisiana iris: legitimacy and pollen transfer	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						bumblebee pollination; hummingbird pollination; hybridization; mechanical isolation; pollen transfer; pollinator isolation; pre-zygotic isolation; reproductive isolation	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE; HYBRIDIZATION; HYMENOPTERA; VISITATION; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR	Background: Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva can be found in sympatric populations in southern Louisiana. Ethological pollinator isolation is an important reproductive barrier, as the pollination syndromes of Iris brevicaulis flowers result in primarily bumblebee visits, while the pollination syndromes of Iris fulva primarily result in hummingbird visits. Other potentially important components of pollinator isolation - namely, 'legitimacy of visitation' (i.e. whether or not a floral visitor physically interacts with a flower in such a way that it can pick up pollen from an anther or transfer pollen to a stigma) and 'pollen transfer success' (i.e. whether or not a 'legitimate' floral visitor successfully transfers pollen from one flower to the stigma of another) - have not been explored. Hypotheses: Hummingbirds, the primary floral visitors of I. fulva, are more likely to visit I fulva pollination units legitimately than they are the pollination units of I brevicaulis. Furthermore, hummingbirds are more likely to successfully transfer pollen in I. fulva intraspecific visitation bouts compared with either interspecific or I. brevicaulis intraspecific floral visits. Bumblebees, the primary floral visitors of I. brevicaulis, are more likely to visit I brevicaulis pollination units legitimately than they are those of I. fulva. In addition, bumblebees are more likely to successfully transfer pollen in I. brevicaulis intraspecific visitation bouts compared with interspecific or I. fulva intraspecific floral visits. Methods: We recorded the proportion of legitimate floral visits made by bumblebees and hummingbirds to both I. fulva and I. brevicaulis flowers. We also assayed intraspecific and interspecific pollen transfer effectiveness among bumblebees and hummingbirds visiting I. fulva and I. brevicaulis flowers using powdered fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Results: The proportion of legitimate hummingbird visits was higher in I. fulva flowers than in I. brevicaulis flowers, and hummingbirds were more effective at transferring pollen among I. fulva flowers than between I. fulva and I. brevicaulis flowers or among I. brevicaulis flowers. Conversely, the proportion of bumblebee visits that were legitimate was higher in I. brevicaulis than in I. fulva, and bumblebees were more effective at transferring pollen among I. brevicaulis flowers than between I. brevicaulis and I. fulva flowers or among I. fulva flowers. Calculations of reproductive isolation (RI) were quite high such that reproductive isolation due to hummingbird visitation legitimacy was calculated as RI = 0.892, and that due to bumblebee visitation legitimacy as RI= 0.557. Isolation due to hummingbird pollen transfer efficiency was calculated as RI= 0.747, and that of bumblebees as RI= 0.711.

Pollination patterns limit hybridization between two sympatric species of Narcissus (Amaryllidaceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Amaryllidaceae; breeding system; conservation biology; flowering phenology; hybridization; Narcissus cavanillesii; Narcissus serotinus; pollination ecology	REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; POTENTIAL HYBRIDIZATION; CONSERVATION; RARE; EXTINCTION; HYBRIDS; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS; SUCCESS	Natural hybrids between rare and common sympatric species are commonly eradicated to avoid the potential extinction of the rare species, although there is currently no clear predictive framework to quantify this risk. As hybrids can have intrinsic value as new evolutionary pathways, further knowledge on the factors controlling hybridization is needed. In this study we evaluated the role of pollination patterns in hybridization events in two sympatric populations of Narcissus cavanillesii and N. serotinus in Portugal. Narcissus cavanillesii is a rare species, while N. serotinus is widely distributed across the Mediterranean. The hybrid, N. Xperezlarae, is quite frequent in southeastern Spain but is scarce in Portugal. Reciprocal manual crossings confirmed compatibility between the two species, although hybridization was more successful when N. cavanillesii participated as female. Narcissus cavanillesii and N. serotinus only shared one pollinator, Megachile sp. (Hymenoptera), which had low visitation rates and high flower constancy. No single isolation mechanism was fully effective in preventing hybridization. Temporal displacement of flowering peaks, strong pollinator specificity, and high flower constancy in the shared pollinator all contributed to limiting hybridization in this site. In other sympatric occurrences, different phenological windows and pollination assemblages may allow greater frequency of the hybrid.

Social and Population Structure in the Ant Cataglyphis emmae	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENETIC-STRUCTURE; HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS; COLONY; DISPERSAL; EVOLUTION; NUMBER; SEX; DNA; PARTHENOGENESIS; CONNECTIVITY	Dispersal has consequences not only for individual fitness, but also for population dynamics, population genetics and species distribution. Social Hymenoptera show two contrasting colony reproductive strategies, dependent and independent colony foundation modes, and these are often associated to the population structures derived from inter and intra-population gene flow processes conditioned by alternative dispersal strategies. Here we employ microsatellite and mitochondrial markers to investigate the population and social genetic structure and dispersal patterns in the ant Cataglyphis emmae at both, local and regional scales. We find that C. emmae is monogynous and polyandrous. Lack of detection of any population viscosity and population structure with nuclear markers at the local scale suggests efficient dispersal, in agreement with a lack of inbreeding. Contrasting demographic differences before and during the mating seasons suggest that C. emmae workers raise sexuals in peripheric nest chambers to reduce intracolonial conflicts. The high genetic differentiation recovered from the mtDNA haplotypes, together with the significant correlation of such to geographic distance, and presence of new nuclear alleles between areas (valleys) suggest long-term historical isolation between these regions, indicative of limited dispersal at the regional scale. Our findings on the ecological, social and population structure of this species increases our understanding of the patterns and processes involved under independent colony foundation.

Molecular phylogenies reveal host-specific divergence of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato following its host ants	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						formicine ants; host specificity; molecular phylogenies; Ophiocordyceps unilateralis; speciation	FUNGUS METARHIZIUM-ANISOPLIAE; TROPICAL FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PATHOGENIC FUNGUS; COMPLEX; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; CONSERVATION; RECOGNITION; MECHANISMS	Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (Hypocreales, Ascomycetes) is an entomopathogenic fungus specific to formicine ants (Formicinae, Hymenoptera). Previous works have shown that the carpenter ant Camponotus leonardi acts as the principal host with occasional infections of ants from the genus Polyrhachis (sister genus of Camponotus). Observations were made on the permanent plots of Mo Singto, Khao Yai National Park of Thailand according to which O.unilateralis was found to occur predominantly on three host species: C.leonardi, C.saundersi and P.furcata. Molecular phylogenies of the elongation factor 1-a and beta-Tubulin genes indicate a separation of O.unilateralis samples into three clades, reflecting specificity to each of the three different ant species. Samples collected from P.furcata and from C.leonardi were found to form sister groups with samples from C.saundersi forming an outgroup to the latter. Additional samples collected from unidentified ant species of Camponotus and Polyrhachis were positioned as outgroups to those samples on identified species. These results demonstrate that O. unilateralis is clearly not a single phylogenetic species and comprises at least three species that are specific to different host ant species. These cryptic species may arise through recent events of speciation driven by their specificity to host ant species.

Prevalence of legitimate pollinators and nectar robbers and the consequences for fruit set in an Antirrhinum majus hybrid zone	BOTANY LETTERS			English	Article						Nectar robbing; pollination; bumblebee; hybrid zone; Antirrhinum	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; PLANT REPRODUCTION; MEDIATED SELECTION; BUMBLE BEES; FLOWERS; MUTUALISM; PATTERNS; HYMENOPTERA; ENERGETICS; BARRIERS	Pollinators display a remarkable diversity of foraging strategies with flowering plants, from primarily mutualistic interactions to cheating through nectar robbery. Despite numerous studies on the effect of nectar robbing on components of plant fitness, its contribution to reproductive isolation is unclear. We experimentally tested the impact of different pollinator strategies in a natural hybrid zone between two subspecies of Antirrhinum majus with alternate flower colour guides. On either side of a steep cline in flower colour between Antirrhinum majus pseudomajus (magenta) and A. m. striatum (yellow), we quantified the behaviour of all floral visitors at different time points during the flowering season. Using long-run camera surveys, we quantify the impact of nectar robbing on the number of flowers visited per inflorescence and the flower probing time. We further experimentally tested the effect of nectar robbing on female reproductive success by manipulating the intensity of robbing. While robbing increased over time the number of legitimate visitors tended to decrease concomitantly. We found that the number of flowers pollinated on a focal inflorescence decreased with the number of prior robbing events. However, in the manipulative experiment, fruit set and fruit volume did not vary significantly between low robbing and control treatments. Our findings challenge the idea that robbers have a negative impact on plant fitness through female function. This study also adds to our understanding of the components of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation and the maintenance of Antirrhinum hybrid zones.

Reproductive interference and fecundity affect competitive interactions of sibling species with low mating barriers: experimental and theoretical evidence	HEREDITY			English	Article							CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY; HYMENOPTERA-APHELINIDAE; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; ENCARSIA-PERGANDIELLA; PREMATING ISOLATION; AEDES-AEGYPTI; EVOLUTION; WOLBACHIA; SPECIATION; REINFORCEMENT	When allopatric species with incomplete prezygotic isolation come into secondary contact, the outcome of their interaction is not easily predicted. The parasitoid wasp Encarsia suzannae (iES), infected by Cardinium inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), and its sibling species E. gennaroi (EG), not infected by bacterial endosymbionts, may have diverged because of the complementary action of CI and asymmetric hybrid incompatibilities. Whereas postzygotic isolation is now complete because of sterility of F1 hybrid progeny, prezygotic isolation is still incipient. We set up laboratory population cage experiments to evaluate the outcome of the interaction between ES and EG in two pairwise combinations: iES vs EG and cured ES (cES, where Cardinium was removed with antibiotics) vs EG. We also built a theoretical model aimed at exploring the role of life-history differences and asymmetric mating on competitive outcomes. In three of four cages in each treatment, ES dominated the interaction. We found evidence for reproductive interference, driven by asymmetric mating preferences, that gave a competitive edge to ES, the species that better discriminated against heterospecifics. However, we did not find the fecundity cost previously shown to be associated with Cardinium infection in iES. The model largely supported the experimental results. The finding of only a slight competitive edge of ES over EG in population cages suggests that in a more heterogeneous environment the species could coexist. This is supported by evidence that the two species coexist in sympatry, where preliminary data suggest reproductive character displacement may have reinforced postzygotic isolation.

Intrinsic survival advantage of social insect queens depends on reproductive activation	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						ageing; caste; fertility; Formicidae; longevity; social evolution	LIFE-SPAN; BEE; INCREASES; LONGEVITY; SELECTION; EVOLUTION; COLONIES	The central trade-off between reproduction and longevity dominates most species' life history. However, no mortality cost of reproduction is apparent in eusocial species, particularly social insects in the order Hymenoptera: one or a few individuals (typically referred to as queens) in a group specialize on reproduction and are generally longer lived than all other group members (typically referred to as workers), despite having the same genome. However, it is unclear whether this survival advantage is due to social facilitation by the group or an intrinsic, individual property. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the correlation between reproduction and longevity is due to a direct mechanistic link or an indirect consequence of the social role of the reproductives. To begin addressing these questions, we performed a comparison of queen and worker longevity in the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior under social isolation conditions. Survival of single queens and workers was compared under laboratory conditions, monitoring and controlling for brood production. Our results indicate that there is no intrinsic survival advantage of queens relative to workers unless individuals are becoming reproductively active. This interactive effect of caste and reproduction on life expectancy outside of the normal social context suggests that the positive correlation between reproduction and longevity in social insect queens is due to a direct link that can activate intrinsic survival mechanisms to ensure queen longevity.

The genus Drosophila is characterized by a large number of sibling species showing evolutionary significance	JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Review						sibling species; evolutionary significance; Drosophila	ALPHA-AMANITIN TOLERANCE; HYBRID MALE-STERILITY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS; CYTOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS; MELANOGASTER-SUBGROUP; CHROMOSOMAL EVOLUTION; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; MONTIUM SUBGROUP; WILLISTONI GROUP	Mayr (1942) defined sibling species as sympatric forms which are morphologically very similar or indistinguishable, but which possess specific biological characteristics and are reproductively isolated. Another term, cryptic species has also been used for such species. However, this concept changed later. Sibling species are as similar as twins. This category does not necessarily include phylogenetic siblings as members of a superspecies. Since the term sibling species was defined by Mayr, a large number of cases of sibling species pairs/groups have been reported and thus they are widespread in the animal kingdom. However, they seem to be more common in some groups such as insects. In insects, they have been reported in diptera, lepidoptera, coleoptera, orthoptera, hymenoptera and others. Sibling species are widespread among the dipteran insects and as such are well studied because some species are important medically (mosquitoes), genetically (Drosophila) and cytologically (Sciara and Chironomus). The well-studied classical pairs of sibling species in Drosophila are: D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, and D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Subsequently, a number of sibling species have been added to these pairs and a large number of other sibling species pairs/groups in different species groups of the genus Drosophila have been reported in literature. The present review briefly summarizes the cases of sibling species pairs/groups in the genus Drosophila with their evolutionary significance.

J	Steffan-Dewenter, I; Tscharntke, T				Steffan-Dewenter, I; Tscharntke, T			Effects of habitat isolation on pollinator communities and seed set	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						habitat fragmentation; pollination; resource limitation; plant reproduction; foraging radius	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; PLANT REPRODUCTION; EUROPEAN COMMUNITY; POLLEN LIMITATION; POPULATION-SIZE; PATCH SIZE; FRAGMENTATION; BEES; DENSITY; VISITATION	Destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats is the major reason for the decreasing biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. Loss of populations may negatively affect biotic interactions and ecosystem stability. Here we tested the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation affects bee populations and thereby disrupts plant-pollinator interactions. We experimentally established small "habitat islands" of two self-incompatible, annual crucifers on eight calcareous grasslands and in the intensively managed agricultural landscape at increasing distances (up to 1000 m) from these species-rich grasslands to measure effects of isolation on both pollinator guilds and seed set, independently from patch size and density, resource availability and genetic erosion of plant populations. Each habitat island consisted of four pots each with one plant of mustard (Sinapis arvensis) and radish (Raphanus sativus). Increasing isolation of the small habitat islands resulted in both decreased abundance and species richness of flower-visiting bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Mean body size of flower-visiting wild bees was larger on isolated than on nonisolated habitat islands emphasizing the positive correlation of body size and foraging distance. Abundance of flower-visiting honeybees depended on the distance from the nearest apiary. Abundance of other flower visitors such as hover flies did not change with increasing isolation. Number of seeds per fruit and per plant decreased significantly with increasing distance from the nearest grassland for both mustard and radish. Mean seed set per plant was halved at a distance of approximately 1000 m for mustard and at 250 m for radish. In accordance with expectations, seed set per plant was positively correlated with the number of flower-visiting bees. We found no evidence for resource limitation in the case of mustard and only marginal effects for radish. We conclude that habitat connectivity is essential to maintain not only abundant and diverse bee communities, but also plant-pollinator interactions in economically important crops and endangered wild plants.

Insect population size is regulated by both intrinsic traits of organisms and extrinsic factors. The impacts of natural enemies are typically considered to be extrinsic factors. however insects have traits that affect their vulnerability to attack by natural enemies, and thus intrinsic and extrinsic factors can interact in their effects on population size. 2. Pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in New York and Maryland that are specialised on alfalfa are approximately two times more physiologically resistant to parasitism by Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) than pea aphids specialised on clover. To assess the potential influence of this genetically based difference in resistance to parasitism on pea aphid population dynamics, pea aphids, A. ervi, and other natural enemies of aphids in clover and alfalfa fields were sampled. 3. Rates of successful parasitism by A. ervi were higher and pea aphid Population sizes were lower in clover, where the aphids are less resistant to parasitism. In contrast. mortality due to a fungal pathogen of pea aphids was higher in alfalfa. Generalist aphid predators did not differ significantly in density between the crops. 4. To explore whether intrinsic resistance to parasitism influences field dynamics, the relationship between resistance and successful field parasitism in 12 populations was analysed. The average level of resistance of a population strongly predicts rates of successful parasitism in the field. The ability of the parasitoid to regulate the aphid may vary among pea aphid populations of different levels of resistance.

We surveyed allozyme markers and sequences of the mtDNA COI gene in several closely related nominal species from two areas of sympatry in the native ranges to learn whether the morphology-based delimitation of these species is supported by genetic data. We found that Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri, pest species whose distinctiveness has been debated, appear to be fully reproductively isolated at both study sites. This isolation contrasts with the extensive hybridization occurring between them in the USA, where both have been introduced. We also found strong genetic differentiation consistent with barriers to gene flow between Solenopsis quinquecuspis and the other two species. However, several lines of evidence suggest that nuclear and mitochondrial genes of S. invicta and S. richteri are introgressing into S. quinquecuspis. The latter apparently is a recently derived member of the clade that includes all three species, suggesting that there has been insufficient time for its full development of intrinsic isolating mechanisms. Finally, our discovery of genetically distinct populations within both S. invicta and S. richteri suggests the presence of previously unrecognized (cryptic) species. Their existence, together with the difficulties in developing diagnostic morphological characters for described species, imply that the group is actively radiating species and that morphological divergence generally does not keep pace with the development of reproductive isolation and neutral genetic divergence in this process.

Behavioral and spermatogenic hybrid male breakdown in Nasonia	HEREDITY			English	Article						Nasonia; courtship behavior; spermatogenesis; hybrid sterility; speciation	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR; SEXUAL ISOLATION; MATING-BEHAVIOR; HALDANES RULE; UNISEXUAL STERILITY; DROSOPHILA; HYMENOPTERA; SPECIATION; WASP	Several reproductive barriers exist within the Nasonia species complex, including allopatry, premating behavioral isolation, postzygotic inviability and Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility. Here we show that hybrid males suffer two additional reproductive disadvantages, an inability to properly court females and decreased sperm production. Hybrid behavioral sterility, characterized by a reduced ability of hybrids to perform necessary courtship behaviors, occurs in hybrids between two species of Nasonia. Hybrid males produced in crosses between N. vitripennis and N. giraulti courted females at a reduced frequency (23-69%), compared with wild-type N. vitripennis and N. giraulti males (> 93%). Reduced courtship frequency was not a simple function of inactivity among hybrids. A strong effect of cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) background was also found in N. vitripennis and N. giraulti crosses; F2 hybrids with giraulti cytoplasm showing reduced ability at most stages of courtship. Hybrids produced between a younger species pair, N. giraulti and N. longicornis, were behaviorally fertile. All males possessed motile sperm, but sperm production is greatly reduced in hybrids between the older species pair, N. vitripennis and N. giraulti. This effect on hybrid males, lowered sperm counts rather than nonfunctional sperm, is different from most described cases of hybrid male sterility, and may represent an earlier stage of hybrid sperm breakdown. The results add to previous studies of F2 hybrid inviability and behavioral sterility, and indicate that Wolbachia-induced hybrid incompatibility has arisen early in species divergence, relative to behavioral sterility and spermatogenic infertility.

Hook. were studied in a population located in central Chile. Flowering extends from mid August to the end of December. The small, white, entomophilous flowers are incompletely protandrous and last c. 5 days. A weak, pleasant odour along with nectar and pollen attracts 17 diurnal insect species, seven of which are probable pollinators: these include Diptera (Syrphidae and Bombyliidae), Hymenoptera (Apidae and Colletidae) and Coleoptera (Melyridae). Besides perfect flowers T. quinquenervia individuals possess c. 10% staminate flowers, which are lighter, seem to he shorter-lived, and show a smaller gynoecium with abnormal ovules. Reproduction is exclusively sexual and apparently xenogamous, with pollen transfer depending on insect vectors. Although flower morphology and individual flower phenology do not fully prevent self-pollination land geitonogamy can easily take place) the level of autogamy is low. Therefore, some self-incompatibility mechanism seems operative in this species. Fruit set of open-pollinated flowers is 6.6%, and ripe fruits contain on average 0.66 viable seeds. Predispersal (maternal) reproductive success (percent ovules becoming viable seeds) is 1.45%. For medium to full-sized individuals this corresponds to c. 2600 to 8600 potential offspring per year. Beyond the production of male flowers, four other aspects of the species' reproductive biology seem directed to enhance pollen export, partly implying increased male allocation: (a) a high pollen:ovule ratio, (b) protection of anthers against pollen-robbing by means of the cucullate petals, (c) secondary pollen presentation in a hairy barrier located above the nectary, and (d) a reduction in female allocation achieved by the regular abortion of two out of the three ovules in each ovary, thus producing a mostly one-seeded fruit provided with a thin, energy-poor pericarp. It is proposed that the advantages of enhanced pollen flow for a self-incompatible organism, which is moreover structured in isolated populations: might explain the increased male effort, including the joint evolution of andromonoecy and one-seededness.

The herbivorous insect, Belonocnema treatae (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), exhibits regional specialization on three plant species whose geographic distributions range from sympatry through allopatry across the southern United States. Using range-wide sampling spanning the geographic ranges of the three host plants and genotyping-by-sequencing of 1,217 individuals, we tested whether this insect herbivore exhibited host plant-associated genomic differentiation while controlling for spatial autocorrelation among the 58 sample sites. Population genomic structure based on 40,699 SNPs was evaluated using the hierarchical Bayesian model entropy to assign individuals to genetic clusters and estimate admixture proportions. To control for spatial autocorrelation, distance-based Moran's eigenvector mapping was used to construct regression variables summarizing spatial structure inherent among sample sites. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) incorporating the spatial variables was then applied to partition host plant-associated differentiation (HAD) from spatial autocorrelation. By combining entropy and dbRDA to analyse SNP data, we unveiled a complex mosaic of highly structured differentiation within and among gall-former populations finding evidence that geography, HAD and spatial autocorrelation all play significant roles in explaining patterns of genomic differentiation in B. treatae. While dbRDA confirmed host association as a significant predictor of patterns of genomic variation, spatial autocorrelation among sites explained the largest proportion of variation. Our results demonstrate the value of combining dbRDA with hierarchical structural analyses to partition spatial/environmental patterns of genomic variation.

The host microbiota assemblage which constitutes the Nasonia holobiont (a host together with all of its associated microbes) consists of viruses, two heritable bacterial symbionts and a bacterial community dominated in abundance by a few taxa in the gut. In the wild, all four Nasonia species are systematically infected with the obligate intracellular bacterium Wolbachia and can additionally be co infected with Arsenophonus nasoniae, These two reproductive parasites have different transmission modes and host manipulations (cytoplasmic incompatibility vs. male killing, respectively). Pioneering studies on Wolbachia in Nasonia demonstrated that closely related Nasonia species harbor multiple and mutually incompatible Wolbachia strains, resulting in strong symbiont-mediated reproductive barriers that evolved early in the speciation process. Moreover, research on host symbiont interactions and speciation has recently broadened from its historical focus on heritable symbionts to the entire microbial community. In this context, each Nasonia species hosts a distinguishable community of gut bacteria that experiences a temporal succession during host development and members of this bacterial community cause strong hybrid lethality during larval development. In this review, we present the Nasonia species complex as a model system to experimentally investigate questions regarding: (i) the impact of different microbes, including (but not limited to) heritable endosymbionts, on the extended phenotype of the holobiont, (ii) the establishment and regulation of a species-specific microbiota, (iii) the role of the microbiota in speciation, and (iv) the resilience and adaptability of the microbiota in wild populations subjected to different environmental pressures. We discuss the potential for easy microbiota manipulations in Nasonia as a promising experimental approach to address these fundamental aspects.

Sequential divergence and the multiplicative origin of community diversity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						host plant adaptation; parasitoid; Rhagoletis; tritrophic interactions; ecological speciation	RHAGOLETIS-POMONELLA DIPTERA; HOST FRUIT VOLATILES; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; RACE FORMATION; TEPHRITIDAE; PARASITOIDS; INFERENCES; SELECTION	Phenotypic and genetic variation in one species can influence the composition of interacting organisms within communities and across ecosystems. As a result, the divergence of one species may not be an isolated process, as the origin of one taxon could create new niche opportunities for other species to exploit, leading to the genesis of many new taxa in a process termed "sequential divergence." Here, we test for such a multiplicative effect of sequential divergence in a community of host-specific parasitoid wasps, Diachasma alloeum, Utetes canaliculatus, and Diachasmimorpha mellea (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), that attack Rhagoletis pomonella fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae). Flies in the R. pomonella species complex radiated by sympatrically shifting and ecologically adapting to new host plants, the most recent example being the apple-infesting host race of R. pomonella formed via a host plant shift from hawthorn-infesting flies within the last 160 y. Using population genetics, field-based behavioral observations, host fruit odor discrimination assays, and analyses of life history timing, we show that the same host-related ecological selection pressures that differentially adapt and reproductively isolate Rhagoletis to their respective host plants (host-associated differences in the timing of adult eclosion, host fruit odor preference and avoidance behaviors, and mating site fidelity) cascade through the ecosystem and induce host-associated genetic divergence for each of the three members of the parasitoid community. Thus, divergent selection at lower trophic levels can potentially multiplicatively and rapidly amplify biodiversity at higher levels on an ecological time scale, which may sequentially contribute to the rich diversity of life.

A large number of endemic Ophrys species have recently been described, especially within the Mediterranean Basin, which is one of the major species diversity hotspots. Subtle morphological variation and specific pollinator dependence are the two main perceptible criteria for describing numerous endemic taxa. However, the degree to which endemics differ genetically remains a challenging question. Additionally, knowledge regarding the factors underlying the emergence of such endemic entities is limited. To achieve new insights regarding speciation processes in Ophrys, we have investigated species boundaries in the Fly Orchid group (Ophrys insectifera sensu lato) by examining morphological, ecological and genetic evidence. Classically, authors have recognized one widespread taxon (O.insectifera) and two endemics (O. aymoninii from France and O.subinsectifera from Spain). Our research has identified clear morphological and ecological factors segregating among these taxa; however, genetic differences were more ambiguous. Insights from cpDNA sequencing and amplified fragment length polymorphisms genotyping indicated a recent diversification in the three extant Fly Orchid species, which may have been further obscured by active migration and admixture across the European continent. Our genetic results still indicate weak but noticeable phylogeographic clustering that partially correlates with the described species. Particularly, we report several isolated haplotypes and genetic clusters in central and southeastern Europe. With regard to the morphological, ecological and genetic aspects, we discuss the endemism status within the Fly Orchid group from evolutionary, taxonomical and conservation perspectives.

NOV.; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; ALPHA-PROTEOBACTERIA; SACCHARICOCCUS-SACCHARI; ACETOBACTER-TROPICALIS; SCAPHOIDEUS-TITANUS	Recent research in microbe-insect symbiosis has shown that acetic acid bacteria (AAB) establish symbiotic relationships with several insects of the orders Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Homoptera, all relying on sugar-based diets, such as nectars, fruit sugars, or phloem sap. To date, the fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster and Bactrocera oleae, mosquitoes of the genera Anopheles and Aedes, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus, and the mealybug Saccharicoccus sacchari have been found to be associated with the bacterial genera Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter, Gluconobacter, Asaia, and Saccharibacter and the novel genus Commensalibacter. AAB establish symbiotic associations with the insect midgut, a niche characterized by the availability of diet-derived carbohydrates and oxygen and by an acidic pH, selective factors that support AAB growth. AAB have been shown to actively colonize different insect tissues and organs, such as the epithelia of male and female reproductive organs, the Malpighian tubules, and the salivary glands. This complex topology of the symbiosis indicates that AAB possess the keys for passing through body barriers, allowing them to migrate to different organs of the host. Recently, AAB involvement in the regulation of innate immune system homeostasis of Drosophila has been shown, indicating a functional role in host survival. All of these lines of evidence indicate that AAB can play different roles in insect biology, not being restricted to the feeding habit of the host. The close association of AAB and their insect hosts has been confirmed by the demonstration of multiple modes of transmission between individuals and to their progeny that include vertical and horizontal transmission routes, comprising a venereal one. Taken together, the data indicate that AAB represent novel secondary symbionts of insects.

J	Elzinga, JA; Mappes, J; Kaila, L				Elzinga, Jelmer A.; Mappes, Johanna; Kaila, Lauri			Pre- and post-mating reproductive barriers drive divergence of five sympatric species of Naryciinae moths (Lepidoptera: Psychidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						bagworm moth; CAD; COI; genitalia; hybridization; isolation mechanism; morphometrics; phylogeny; speciation	BAGWORM MOTHS; DNA; HYMENOPTERA; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; PARTHENOGENESIS; DELIMITATION; PARASITOIDS; BRACONIDAE	The biological species concept suggests that species can be separated on the basis of reproductive isolation. However, because natural interbreeding capabilities are often unknown, differences in morphology are generally used to separate species. Alternatively, genetic dissimilarity is used to separate morphologically similar species. Many genetic markers, including the maternally inherited mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequence, cannot show interbreeding and therefore species status of groups may remain unresolved. In species of the genera Dahlica and Siederia (Lepidoptera: Psychidae: Naryciinae) the lack of morphological distinction and unknown interbreeding has led to unclear and unresolved taxonomic status. Mitochondrial DNA sequences suggest five sexual species to occur in Finland. However, their species status remains unconfirmed, due to a lack of knowledge on interbreeding, unclear morphological distinction and the limited variation in mitochondrial DNA. We combine three methods, a cross-mating experiment, an analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and a detailed male genital morphological examination, to establish the species status of the five suspected species. All suspected species exhibit intraspecies mating preference, although several interspecies pairs readily produce offspring. The genetic analysis, however, fails to show hybrids or introgression, suggesting that both pre- and post-copulation mechanisms isolate the species reproductively. Morphological analysis of the male genitalia confirms that the species have diverged. Our results highlight the need of combining behavioural, morphological and genetic methods to determine species status in challenging taxonomic groups.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 112, 584-605.

This lack is particularly evident in Copepoda, given the extraordinary numerical abundance, and taxonomic and ecological diversity of this group. Tigriopus californicus is ideally suited to serve as a genetic model copepod and has been the subject of extensive work in environmental stress and reproductive isolation. Accordingly, we set out to develop a broadly-useful panel of genetic markers and to construct a linkage map dense enough for quantitative trait locus detection in an interval mapping framework for T. californicus-a first for copepods. Results: One hundred and ninety Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to genotype our mapping population of 250 F-2 larvae. We were able to construct a linkage map with an average intermarker distance of 1.8 cM, and a maximum intermarker distance of 10.3 cM. All markers were assembled into linkage groups, and the 12 linkage groups corresponded to the 12 known chromosomes of T. californicus. We estimate a total genome size of 401.0 cM, and a total coverage of 73.7%. Seventy five percent of the mapped markers were detected in 9 additional populations of T. californicus. Of available model arthropod genomes, we were able to show more colocalized pairs of homologues between T. californicus and the honeybee Apis mellifera, than expected by chance, suggesting preserved macrosynteny between Hymenoptera and Copepoda. Conclusions: Our study provides an abundance of linked markers spanning all chromosomes. Many of these markers are also found in multiple populations of T. californicus, and in two other species in the genus. The genomic resource we have developed will enable mapping throughout the geographical range of this species and in closely related species. This linkage map will facilitate genome sequencing, mapping and assembly in an ecologically and taxonomically interesting group for which genomic resources are currently under development.

They both induce a male biased sex ratio in the incompatible cross. In Nasonia, CI does not reduce fertility since incompatible eggs develop as haploid males, whereas in Tetranychus CI leads to a partial mortality of incompatible eggs, thus reducing the fertility of females. Here, we study Wolbachia infection in a Drosophila parasitoid, Leptopilina heterotoma (Hymenoptera: Figitidae). A survey of Wolbachia infection shows that all natural populations tested are totally infected. Crosses between infected males and cured females show complete incompatibility: almost no females are produced. Moreover, incompatible eggs die early during their development, unlike Nasonia. This early death allows the parasitized Drosophila larva to achieve its development and to emerge. Thus, uninfected females crossed with infected males have reduced offspring production consisting only of males. Evidence of this CI type in insects demonstrates that the difference in CI types of Nasonia and Tetranychus is not due to specific factors of insects or acari. Using theoretical models, we compare the invasion processes of different strategies of Wolbachia: CI in diploid species, the two CI types in haplodiploid species, and parthenogenesis (the classical effect in haplodiploid species). Models show that CI in haplodiploid species is less efficient than in diploid ones. However, the Leptopilina type is advantageous compared to the Nasonia type. Parthenogenesis may be more or less advantageous, depending on the infection cost and on the proportion of fertilized eggs. Finally, we can propose different processes of Wolbachia strategy evolution in haplodiploid species from Nasonia CI type to Leptopilina CI type or parthenogenesis.

Genetic differentiation across the social transition in a socially polymorphic sweat bee, Halictus rubicundus	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						eusociality; gene flow; halictid bee; microsatellite; plastic behaviour; population genetic structure	POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION; F-STATISTICS; HYMENOPTERA; FLOW; ORGANIZATION; SELECTION; SOLITARY; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; ASSOCIATIONS	Eusociality is widely considered a major evolutionary transition. The socially polymorphic sweat bee Halictus rubicundus, solitary in cooler regions of its Holarctic range and eusocial in warmer parts, is an excellent model organism to address this transition, and specifically the question of whether sociality is associated with a strong barrier to gene flow between phenotypically divergent populations. Mitochondrial DNA (COI) from specimens collected across the British Isles, where both solitary and social phenotypes are represented, displayed limited variation, but placed all specimens in the same European lineage; haplotype network analysis failed to differentiate solitary and social lineages. Microsatellite genetic variability was high and enabled us to quantify genetic differentiation among populations and social phenotypes across Great Britain and Ireland. Results from conceptually different analyses consistently showed greater genetic differentiation between geographically distant populations, independently of their social phenotype, suggesting that the two social forms are not reproductively isolated. A landscape genetic approach revealed significant isolation by distance (Mantel test r = 0.622, P < 0.001). The Irish Sea acts as physical barrier to gene flow (partial Mantel test r = 0.453, P < 0.01), indicating that geography, rather than expression of solitary or social behaviour (partial Mantel test r = -0.238, P = 0.053), had a significant effect on the genetic structure of H. rubicundus across the British Isles. Although we cannot reject the hypothesis of a genetic underpinning to differences in solitary and eusocial phenotypes, our data clearly demonstrate a lack of reproductive isolation between the two social forms.

J	Cohen, P; Privman, E				Cohen, Pnina; Privman, Eyal			Speciation and hybridization in invasive fire ants	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article							APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; SPONTANEOUS MUTATION-RATE; SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA; POPULATION HISTORY; GENETIC-VARIATION; EVOLUTIONARY; HYMENOPTERA; WOLBACHIA; NUMBER; ORGANIZATION	BackgroundA major focus of evolutionary biology is the formation of reproductive barriers leading to divergence and ultimately, speciation. Often, it is not clear whether the separation of populations is complete or if there still is ongoing gene flow in the form of rare cases of admixture, known as isolation with migration. Here, we studied the speciation of two fire ant species, Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri, both native to South America, both inadvertently introduced to North America in the early twentieth century. While the two species are known to admix in the introduced range, in the native range no hybrids were found.ResultsWe conducted a population genomic survey of native and introduced populations of the two species using reduced representation genomic sequencing of 337 samples. Using maximum likelihood analysis over native range samples, we found no evidence of any gene flow between the species since they diverged. We estimated their time of divergence to 190,000 (100,000-350,000) generations ago. Modelling the demographic history of native and introduced S. invicta populations, we evaluated their divergence times and historic and contemporary population sizes, including the original founder population in North America, which was estimated at 26 (10-93) unrelated singly-mated queens.ConclusionsWe provide evidence for complete genetic isolation maintained between two invasive species in their native range, based, for the first time, on large scale genomic data analysis. The results lay the foundations for further studies into different stages in the formation of genetic barriers in dynamic, invasive populations.

Two stage of development in eu-social insects are recognized. Resocial stage (bumble-beers, polist wasps, etc) is characterized by two spheres of functioning being incompletely separated, longevity of the family is restricted by life span of one generation of reproductive individuals, solitary and family phases repeat cyclically without overlapping. Nomosocial stage (ants, termites, honey beer, etc): two spheres of functioning are completely isolated, the family is not restricted by life span of particular reproductive individuals, resocialization stage is not prerequisite.

Initially being investigated as a mermithergate, its true reproductive nature was finally proven after several years of searching for fresh specimens for dissection and imaging. Two possibilities remain unresolved regarding the reproductive strategy seen in the Philippine local populations of P. aglae: (1) that they are secondary reproductives; or (2) winged queens have been eliminated from the Philippine population due to isolation on oceanic islands. The exceptional reproductive strategy was found in the oceanic islands of Luzon and nearby Polillo. Further research is needed by taking account of the "island syndrome". This study also highlights the unexpected directions that problems in biological research take the researcher.

Cascading reproductive isolation: Plant phenology drives temporal isolation among populations of a host-specific herbivore	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Belonocnema treatae; live oak; multitrophic multieffect trait; Quercus; reproductive isolation	DEPENDENT POSTMATING ISOLATION; NATURAL-SELECTION; SEXUAL ISOLATION; SPECIATION; DIVERGENCE; RACES; DIFFERENTIATION; HYMENOPTERA; ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION	All organisms exist within a complex network of interacting species, thus evolutionary change may have reciprocal effects on multiple taxa. Here, we demonstrate "cascading reproductive isolation," whereby ecological differences that reduce gene flow between populations at one trophic level affect reproductive isolation (RI) among interacting species at the next trophic level. Using a combination of field, laboratory and common-garden studies and long-term herbaria records, we estimate and evaluate the relative contribution of temporal RI to overall prezygotic RI between populations of Belonocnema treatae, a specialist gall-forming wasp adapted to sister species of live oak (Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata). We link strong temporal RI between host-associated insect populations to differences between host plant budbreak phenology. Budbreak initiates flowering and the production of new leaves, which are an ephemeral resource critical to insect reproduction. As flowering time is implicated in RI between plant species, budbreak acts as a "multitrophic multi-effect trait," whereby differences in budbreak phenology contribute to RI in plants and insects. These sister oak species share a diverse community of host-specific gall-formers and insect natural enemies similarly dependent on ephemeral plant tissues. Thus, our results set the stage for testing for parallelism in a role of plant phenology in driving temporal cascading RI across multiple species and trophic levels.

However, speciation may also occur in the absence of geographic barriers due to phenotypic and genotypic factors such as chemical cue divergence, mating signal divergence, and mitonuclear conflict. Here, we performed an integrative study based on two genome-wide techniques (3RAD and ultraconserved elements) coupled with cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequence data, to assess the species limits within the Ectatomma ruidum species complex, a widespread and conspicuous group of Neotropical ants for which heteroplasmy (i.e., presence of multiple mtDNA variants in an individual) has been recently discovered in some populations from southeast Mexico. Our analyses indicate the existence of at least five distinct species in this complex: two widely distributed across the Neotropics, and three that are restricted to southeast Mexico and that apparently have high levels of heteroplasmy. We found that species boundaries in the complex did not coincide with geographic barriers. We therefore consider possible roles of alternative drivers that may have promoted the observed patterns of speciation, including mitonuclear incompatibility, CHC differentiation, and colony structure. Our study highlights the importance of simultaneously assessing different sources of evidence to disentangle the species limits of taxa with complicated evolutionary histories.

HYMENOPTERA; LABIAL GLAND; DIVERGENCE; APIDAE; LEPIDOPTERA; ATTRACTION; SECRETIONS; SPILLOVER	Many species display local variations in pre-mating signals and in mating preferences. This may lead to discrimination against potential foreign mates that may ultimately lead to reproductive isolation. However, the extent to which population differentiation in mating cues affects the species recognition has received little empirical support. Here, we investigate the consequence of geographic differentiation in male reproductive traits on female preferences to these traits in Bombus terrestris. We characterise (1) the geographic differentiation in male cephalic labial gland secretions (CLGS), a key trait for mate attraction, and (2) the preference of virgin females to the CLGS of different subspecies. Our results show geographic CLGS differences parallel with divergences in female preferences for these secretions. This geographic CLGS differentiation in males, along with female preference for sympatric males, could lead to or reflect a pre-mating isolation among subspecies.

Ant colonies reproduce and disperse via the flights of winged alates. Few data exist on the reproductive phenologies of ant assemblages. Here we analyze the reproductive phenologies of 81 common ant species from 23,182 individuals collected over 3 years on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI). Species ranged from highly synchronous to continuous fliers, but showed a median flight duration of at least 8 of 13 lunar months. In two statistical analyses (variance ratio test and Spearman rank correlations), 84% (16 of 19) of ant genera had species trending toward positively associated phenologies, more than expected by chance (P <0.00036 by a binomial test). Thus, there was little evidence for the hypothesis that competition for limiting resources staggers congeneric flights and ultimately promotes reproductive isolation. On the contrary, the timing of reproduction, and its synchrony, tended to be conserved within genera and subfamilies. These results closely match phenological studies of plant assemblages. The continuous reproduction and small colony size of many species in this study suggest that the female calling syndrome, a poorly documented mating system in ants, may be common on BCl.

During Ice Ages, populations isolated in allopatric glacial refugia can experience differentiation in reproductive traits through divergence in selection regimes. This phenomenon may lead to reproductive isolation and dramatically accentuates the consequences of the climatic oscillations on species. Alternatively, when reproductive isolation is incomplete and populations are expanding again, further mating between the formerly isolated populations can result in the formation of a hybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through reproductive trait displacements. Therefore changes in reproductive traits driven by population movements during climatic oscillations can act as an important force in promoting pre-zygotic isolation. Notwithstanding, divergence of reproductive traits has not been approached in the context of climatic oscillations. Here we investigate the impact of population movements driven by climatic oscillations on a reproductive trait of a bumblebee species (Bombus lapidarius). We characterise the pattern of variation and differentiation across the species distribution (i) with five genes (nuclear and mitochondrial), and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees. Results: Our results provide evidence that populations have experienced a genetic allopatric differentiation, in at least three main refugia (the Balkans, Centre-Eastern Europe, and Southern Italy) during Quaternary glaciations. The comparative chemical analyses show that populations from the Southern Italian refugium have experienced MMS differentiation and an incipient speciation process from another refugium. The meeting of Southern Italian populations with other populations as a result of range expansion at a secondary contact zone seems to have led to a reinforcement process on local MMS patterns. Conclusions: This study suggests that population movement during Quaternary climatic oscillations can lead to divergence in reproductive traits by allopatric differentiation during Ice Ages and by reinforcement during post-glacial recolonization.

J	Kitthawee, S; Dujardin, JP				Kitthawee, Sangvorn; Dujardin, Jean-Pierre			The Diachasmimorpha longicaudata complex: Reproductive isolation and geometric patterns of the wing	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL			English	Article						Diachasmimorpha longicaudata; Thailand; Cryptic species; Crossing experiments; Morphometrics	FLIES DIPTERA; HYMENOPTERA; MORPHOMETRICS; PSYCHODIDAE; TEPHRITIDAE; BRACONIDAE	Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is an endoparasitoid of Tephritid fruit fly larvae and is regarded as an important biocontrol agent. However, it is likely that under this specific name several biological species may be contained, the correct identification of which is essential for effective use in control programs. In this paper, three populations (DLA, DLB and DLBB) of D. longicaudata designated according to geography and/or natural hosts were reared in the same laboratory. They were tested for reproductive compatibility and characterized by morphometric analyzes. Forced-contact mating technique showed either complete lack of inter-population reproductive compatibility or the production of rare, sterile female offspring. The three populations, indistinguishable on the basis of morphological characters alone, were readily identified by the geometry of the wing. Results strongly suggest that the DLA, DLB and DLBB are distinct biological species, and highlight the usefulness of wing geometry to distinguish them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Cahan, SH; Julian, GE; Schwander, T; Keller, L				Cahan, Sara Helms; Julian, Glennis E.; Schwander, Tanja; Keller, Laurent			Reproductive isolation between Pogonomyrmex rugosus and two lineages with genetic caste determination	ECOLOGY			English	Article						caste determination; hybrid; reproductive isolation; social hybridogenesis; social insects; speciation	HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; ANTS; HETEROZYGOSITY; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATIONS; ADAPTATION; TRANSITION; SPECIATION; ECOLOGY	Hybrid speciation occurs when combination of two interspecific genomes results in individuals that are of high fitness but reproductively incompatible with the parental species. Although hybrid speciation is a relatively common source of new species in plants, it appears to be a much rarer occurrence in animal taxa. Here we report on reproductive isolation and range overlap between the rough harvester ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus and two lineages with hybrid genotypes (H1 and H2). Both lineages obligately interbreed and produce genetically distinct queen and worker offspring, a phenomenon referred to as genetic caste determination (GCD). Diploid offspring produced by gametes of the same lineage develop only into queens, whereas diploid offspring derived from gametes of distinct lineages develop into workers. We investigated small-scale patterns of gene flow between the parent and the two H lineages by sampling along an 80-km transect between a pure P. rugosus population and a two-lineage population. Microsatellite and mitochondrial markers both indicated virtually no gene flow between the parent species and either lineage even at sites where parental and H-lineage colonies co-occurred. The geographic ranges of the parental species and the two-lineage population were essentially parapatric, with a surprisingly narrow band of overlap and evidence of spatial structuring even at microgeographic scales within the transition zone. This suggests that ecological competition with the parent species plays a significant role in determining the evolutionary persistence and current distribution of the hybrid lineages and the genetic caste system.

Lack of floral constancy by bee fly pollinators: implications for ethological isolation in an African daisy	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						assortative mating; Bombyliidae; floral constancy; Gorteria diffusa; pollination; reproductive isolation; South Africa; species integrity	FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; FLOWER CONSTANCY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; POPULATIONS; PATTERNS; PREFERENCES; HYMENOPTERA	Although divergent floral preferences of pollinating species is a likely mechanism maintaining integrity of co-occurring floral ecotypes or incipient species, reproductive isolation of floral morphs could also result from temporary floral constancy of shared pollinators. Context-dependent floral preferences have been demonstrated for many pollinating insects, suggesting that this behavior might be widespread. However, it is not yet known whether 2 plant species or morphotypes that share a single pollinator could be reproductively isolated through assortative visitation. We investigated the foraging behavior of the bee fly, Megapalpus capensis, in experimental arrays of distinct floral morphotypes of Gorteria diffusa, a South African daisy which is pollinated almost exclusively by M. capensis. Flies exhibited no intrinsic or context-dependent (according to prevailing morph) preference for floral variants nor do they display floral constancy behavior during visitation bouts. Thus, pollinator isolation through assortative visitation is an unlikely explanation for the maintenance of floral integrity across the narrow contact zones encountered in Gorteria. Despite random visitation patterns on arrays, flies exhibited different behaviors on different floral morphotypes, suggesting intrinsic responses to morphotype-specific floral cues. Our findings suggest that results of previous studies demonstrating labile preferences and constancy in insects such as bees and butterflies cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other important groups of pollinators. In pollinators, such as Megapalpus, which use flowers as arenas for multiple behaviors, including mating, and feed during long stationary bouts, learning constraints on flower handling time, the most widely accepted explanation for floral constancy, is unlikely to drive constant foraging behavior.

We compared this strain, which is originating from The Netherlands (EVP), with a native strain from Hokkaido, Northern Japan (SPR) in several characteristics. The percentage of parasitism of SPR and EVP was significantly different, when attacking three aphid species: 13% and 30% on M. euphorbiae on tomato, 68% and 93% on Acyrthosiphon pisum on broad bean and 10% and 42% on Aulacorthum solani on sweet pepper, respectively. SPR and EVP differed morphologically (in the colouration of the petiole) and in the esterase banding patterns. Furthermore, cross mating experiments showed that SPR and EVP are partially reproductively isolated from each other. Complete reproductive isolation is evident in the one direction cross (EVP females and SPR males).

However, the isolation status and the relationship between parental divergence and post-mating isolation among closely related sympatric specialists are still poorly understood. Here, multi-locus sequence were used to estimate the relationship among three host plant-specific closely related flea beetles, Altica cirsicola, A. fragariae and A. viridicyanea (abbreviated as AC, AF and AV respectively). The tree topologies were inconsistent using different gene or different combinations of gene fragments. The relationship of AF+(AC+AV) was supported, however, by both gene tree and species tree based on concatenated data. Post-mating reproductive data on the results of crossing these three species are best interpreted in the light of a well established phylogeny. Nuclear-induced but not Wolbachia-induced unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility, which was detected in AC-AF and AF-AV but not in AC-AV, may also suggest more close genetic affinity between AC and AV. Prevalence of Wolbachia in these three beetles, and the endosymbiont in most individuals of AV and AC sharing a same wsp haplotype may give another evidence of AF+(AC+AV). Our study also suggested that these three flea beetles diverged in a relative short time (0.94 My), which may be the result of shifting between unrelated host plants and distinct host specificity. Incomplete post-mating isolation while almost complete lineage sorting indicated that effective pre-mating isolation among these three species should have evolved.

Genetics of postzygotic isolation and Haldane's rule in haplodiploids	HEREDITY			English	Review						postzygotic isolation; Haldane's rule; Dobzhansky-Muller interactions; haplodiploidy; Nasonia	INDUCED CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY; POSTMATING REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; HYBRID INCOMPATIBILITIES; DROSOPHILA-SIMULANS; NASONIA HYMENOPTERA; TETRANYCHUS-URTICAE; DOMINANCE THEORY; MATING-BEHAVIOR; SEX-RATIO; SPECIATION	The process of speciation has puzzled scientists for decades, but only recently they have they been able to reveal the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. Much emphasis has been on Haldane's rule, the observation that the heterogametic sex often suffers more from hybridization than the homogametic sex. Most research on Haldane's rule has focused on diploid organisms with chromosomal sex determination. We argue that species lacking chromosomal sex determination, such as haplodiploids, also follow Haldane's rule and thus should be included in the definition of this rule. We provide evidence for Haldane's rule in Nasonia wasps and describe how haplodiploids can be used to test the different theories that have been proposed to explain Haldane's rule. We discuss how the faster-male and faster-X theories can shape speciation differently in haplodiploids compared to diploids.	[Koevoets, T.; Beukeboom, L.

In this study five microsatellite loci were used to investigate genetic structuring of the allodapine bee Exoneura robusta sampled from four locations (maximum pairwise distance c. 35 km) in the Mountain Ash forests of Victoria. Although E. robusta would seem to have high dispersal ability, several analyses show significant population subdivision and a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance from which limited gene flow was inferred. Limited gene flow was not associated with inbreeding at the within-colony level, and within-colony genetic structure implied co-founding, multiple breeding pairs and some degree of reproductive skew. Strong population structure at such fine scales suggests that substantially divergent populations are likely within the extensive distribution currently ascribed to E. robusta.

Temporal isolation between sympatric host plants cascades across multiple trophic levels of host-associated insects	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						allochronic isolation; gall wasp; host-associated differentiation; sequential divergence; phenology	GALL WASPS HYMENOPTERA; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS; LIVE OAK; SPECIATION; POPULATION; DIVERGENCE; VIRGINIANA; CYNIPIDAE	Phenological differences between host plants can promote temporal isolation among host-associated populations of insects with life cycles tightly coupled to plant phenology. Divergence in the timing of spring budbreak between two sympatric sister oak species has been shown to promote temporal isolation between host plants and their host-associated populations of a cynipid gall wasp. Here, we examined the generality of this mechanism by testing the hypothesis of cascading temporal isolation for five additional gall-formers and three natural enemy species associated with these same oak species. The timing of adult emergence from galls differed significantly between host-associated populations for all nine species and parallels the direction of the phenological differences between host plants. Differences in emergence timing can reduce gene flow between host-associated populations by diminishing mating opportunities and/or reducing the fitness of immigrants due to differences in the availability of ephemeral resources. Our study suggests that cascading temporal isolation could be a powerful 'biodiversity generator' across multiple trophic levels in tightly coupled plant-insect systems.

Some sympatric cryptic species share equivalent resources, which contradicts the competitive exclusion principle. Two major theories have been proposed to explain the apparent lack of competitive exclusion, i.e. niche-based coexistence and neutral model, but a conclusive explanation is lacking. Here, we report the co-occurrence of cryptic spider wasp species appearing to be ecologically equivalent. Molecular phylogenetic analyses and mating experiments revealed that three phylogenetically closely related species are found sympatrically in Japan. These species share the same resources for larval food, and two of the species have the same niche for nesting sites, indicating a lack of competitive exclusion. This evidence may suggest that ecologically equivalent species can co-occur stably if their shared resources are sufficiently abundant that they cannot be over-exploited.

Thus, complete reproductive isolation between parapatric populations is not expected, particularly in the absence of ecological adaptation and sharp environmental differences. Here, we explore the biogeographical patterns of an endemic ant species, Cataglyphis floricola, for which two colour morphs (black and bicolour) coexist in parapatry throughout continuous sandy habitat in southern Spain. Discriminant analyses of six biometric measurements of male genitalia and 27 cuticular hydrocarbons reveal high differentiation between morphs. Furthermore, the low number of shared alleles derived from nuclear markers (microsatellites) between the morphs at their contact zone suggests the absence of recent gene flow. Mitochondrial DNA (COI) phylogenetic analysis and median-joining networks show that the black morph is basal to the bicolour morph, with unique haplotypes recovered for each morph. Mismatch distribution analysis and Bayesian skyline plots suggest that they are undergoing different demographic changes, with the bicolour and black morphs at demographic equilibrium and expansion, respectively. Thus, our results show complete reproductive isolation between the two colour morphs as evidenced from genetic, chemical and morphological data. We suggest that these divergence events could be explained by historical vicariance during the Pleistocene, in which reproductive traits experienced strong divergent selection between the morphs initiating or culminating speciation.

Ant-defended plants had increased growth as measured by plant height and number of leaves, and increased reproductive effort as measured by numbers of pods, numbers of seeds, and weight of pods, compared to ant-excluded plants (using Tanglefoot barriers). Survival of herbivore eggs and larvae was reduced in the presence of ants suggesting that ants provide plants with protection from larval herbivory thus increasing the amount of primary production which in turn allows greater reproductive output.

Genome-wide sequence data show no evidence of hybridization and introgression among pollinator wasps associated with a community of Panamanian strangler figs	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Ficus; hybridization; introgression; Pegoscapus; phylogeny; pollination mutualism	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; HYMENOPTERA CHALCIDOIDEA; ACTIVE POLLINATION; HOST-SPECIFICITY; READ ALIGNMENT; FICUS; DIVERSIFICATION; SELECTION; SPECIATION	The specificity of pollinator host choice influences opportunities for reproductive isolation in their host plants. Similarly, host plants can influence opportunities for reproductive isolation in their pollinators. For example, in the fig and fig wasp mutualism, offspring of fig pollinator wasps mate inside the inflorescence that the mothers pollinate. Although often host specific, multiple fig pollinator species are sometimes associated with the same fig species, potentially enabling hybridization between wasp species. Here, we study the 19 pollinator species (Pegoscapus spp.) associated with an entire community of 16 Panamanian strangler fig species (Ficus subgenus Urostigma, section Americanae) to determine whether the previously documented history of pollinator host switching and current host sharing predicts genetic admixture among the pollinator species, as has been observed in their host figs. Specifically, we use genome-wide ultraconserved element (UCE) loci to estimate phylogenetic relationships and test for hybridization and introgression among the pollinator species. In all cases, we recover well-delimited pollinator species that contain high interspecific divergence. Even among pairs of pollinator species that currently reproduce within syconia of shared host fig species, we found no evidence of hybridization or introgression. This is in contrast to their host figs, where hybridization and introgression have been detected within this community, and more generally, within figs worldwide. Consistent with general patterns recovered among other obligate pollination mutualisms (e.g. yucca moths and yuccas), our results suggest that while hybridization and introgression are processes operating within the host plants, these processes are relatively unimportant within their associated insect pollinators.

We use genetic data from 68 markers, combined with distributional, bioclimatic, and coloration information, to hypothesize boundaries of evolutionarily independent lineages (species) within the widespread and highly variable nominal fire ant species Solenopsis saevissima, a member of a species group containing invasive pests as well as species that are models for ecological and evolutionary research. Our integrated approach uses diverse methods of analysis to sequentially test whether populations meet specific operational criteria (contingent properties) for candidacy as morphologically cryptic species, including genetic clustering, monophyly, reproductive isolation, and occupation of distinctive niche space. We hypothesize that nominal S. saevissima comprises at least 4-6 previously unrecognized species, including several pairs whose parapatric distributions implicate the development of intrinsic premating or postmating barriers to gene flow. Our genetic data further suggest that regional genetic differentiation in S. saevissima has been influenced by hybridization with other nominal species occurring in sympatry or parapatry, including the quite distantly related Solenopsis geminata. The results of this study illustrate the importance of employing different classes of genetic data (coding and noncoding regions and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA] markers), different methods of genetic data analysis (tree-based and non-tree based methods), and different sources of data (genetic, morphological, and ecological data) to explicitly test various operational criteria for species boundaries in clades of recently diverged lineages, while warning against over reliance on any single data type (e.g., mtDNA sequence variation) when drawing inferences.

Sex ratio and density may affect temporal variation in size-assortative mating in a Neotropical ant species	ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Body size; Intrasexual competition; Temporal change; Local density; OSR	WESTERN HARVESTER ANT; BODY-SIZE; MATE CHOICE; PHEIDOLE-PALLIDULA; POGONOMYRMEX-OCCIDENTALIS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; FIGHTING ABILITY; MALE HARASSMENT; COLONY FITNESS; FEMALE DENSITY	Size-assortative mating (SAM) is common in animals, especially in insects, owing to the influence of body size on mate choice and fitness in both sexes. According to sexual selection theory, choosiness in mate selection may decrease when the costs of intrasexual competition and mate choice increase. Thus, scenarios with intense mating competition (i.e. with high population density and highly biased sex ratio) should weaken SAM. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in mating aggregations of the ant Tranopelta gilva. During mating swarm, population density and male-bias in sex ratios may increase with time, promoting changes in SAM. Considering this potential variation in SAM, we hypothesized that (a) T. gilva ants assortatively mate by size when male mating competition is weak; (b) larger males win most intrasexual disputes; and (c) there is no significant variation in body size among individuals arriving earlier and later during mating aggregations. We attracted winged ants to open plastic arenas, placed under artificial light at night in a protected area of the Brazilian Savanna. Two intensities of mating competition were comparatively evaluated in the arenas: 'weakly competitive' (low ant density and a slightly male-biased sex ratio) and 'intense competitive' conditions (high ant density and strongly male-biased sex ratio). Assortative mating in T. gilva occurred only when mating competition was weak. Male size was not important in male-male competition and large males did not arrive first at mating aggregations. Because male-male competition did not explain variations in SAM, we suggest that female choice at low densities and male harassment at high densities would explain these variations. In conclusion, mating competition may affect temporal variation in SAM of T. gilva. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Environmental barriers to sociality in an obligate eusocial sweat bee	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Sweat bee; Lasioglossum; Field transplant; Eusocial	HALICTUS-LIGATUS HYMENOPTERA; SUBGENUS EVYLAEUS HYMENOPTERA; LASIOGLOSSUM-MALACHURUM; RUBICUNDUS HYMENOPTERA; COLONY PRODUCTIVITY; NEST ARCHITECTURE; EVOLUTION; SIZE; ORGANIZATION; PATTERNS	Understanding the ecological and environmental contexts in which eusociality can evolve is fundamental to elucidating its evolutionary origins. A sufficiently long active season is postulated to have been a key factor facilitating the transition to eusociality. Many primitively eusocial species exhibit an annual life cycle, which is thought to preclude the expression of eusociality where the active season is too short to produce successive worker and reproductive broods. However, few studies have attempted to test this idea experimentally. We investigated environmental constraints on the expression of eusociality in the obligate primitively eusocial sweat bee Lasioglossum malachurum, by transplanting nest foundresses from the south to the far north of the United Kingdom, far beyond the natural range of L. malachurum. We show that transplanted bees can exhibit eusociality, but that the short length of the season and harsher environmental conditions could preclude its successful expression. In oneyear, when foundresses were transplanted only after provisioning first brood (B1) offspring, workers emerged in the north and provisioned a second brood (B2) of reproductives. In another year, when foundresses were transplanted prior to B1 being provisioned, they were just as likely to initiate nesting and provisioned just as many B1 cells as foundresses in the south. However, the life cycle was delayed by approximately 7weeks and nests suffered 100% B1 mortality. Our results suggest that short season length together with poor weather conditions represent an environmental barrier to the evolution and expression of eusociality in sweat bees.	[Davison, P.

The observed genetic differentiation or reproductive isolation between extant populations may be the outcome of their contemporary geographic separation or reproductive incompatibility due to differences in phenotypic traits which have evolved in isolated refugia. In the boreal ant Leptothorax acervorum, colonies from central and peripheral populations differ in social structure: colonies from Central and Northern Europe may contain several equally reproductive queens (facultative polygyny), while in colonies from peripheral populations in Spain only one the most dominant of several queens lays eggs (functional monogyny). By reconstructing the specie's evolutionary and demographic history in Southwestern Europe we examine whether variation in social organization is associated with restricted gene flow between the two social forms. Results: We show that multi-queen colonies from all so far known inner Iberian populations of L. acervorum are functionally monogynous, whereas multi-queen colonies from all Pyrenean populations are polygynous, like those from other previously studied areas in Europe. Our analyses revealed complex spatial-genetic structure, but no association between spatial-genetic structure and social organization in SW-Europe. The population in the western Pyrenees diverged most strongly from other Iberian populations. Moreover, microsatellite data suggest the occurrence of recent bottlenecks in Pyrenean and inner Iberian populations. Conclusions: Our study shows a lack of reproductive isolation between the two social forms in SW-Europe. This in turn suggests that demographic and spatial patterns in genetic variation as well as the distribution of social phenotypes are better explained by co-variation with climatic, ecological, and historical factors. Moreover, we for the first time show the existence of substantial spatial-genetic structure in L. acervorum, suggesting the existence of multiple refugia in SW-Europe, including two extra-Mediterranean refugia in France.

Sex Attractant Pheromones of Virgin Queens of Sympatric Slave-Making Ant Species in the Genus Polyergus, and their Possible Roles in Reproductive Isolation	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Ant sex pheromone; Reproductive isolation; Sympatric species; Dulosis; 3-ethyl-4-methylpentanol; Methyl (R)-3-ethyl-4-methylpentanoate; Methyl 6-methylsalicylate	RUFESCENS HYMENOPTERA; MATING-BEHAVIOR; FORMICIDAE; BREVICEPS; COMPONENT; GLANDS	Species of the ant genus Polyergus are social parasites that steal brood from colonies of their hosts in the closely related genus Formica. Upon emergence as adults in a mixed population, host Formica workers carry out all the normal worker functions within the Polyergus colony, including foraging, feeding, grooming, and rearing brood of the parasitic Polyergus ants. Some unmated Polyergus gynes (queens) run in the raiding columns of their colonies and attract males by releasing a pheromone from their mandibular glands. There are two Polyergus species groups in North America: an eastern P. lucidus group and a western P. breviceps group. One species of each of these groups, P. lucidus Mayr and P. mexicanus Emery, are sympatric in Missouri. In this study, we characterized the sex pheromones of virgin queens of two species of the P. lucidus group (P. lucidus sensu stricto and P. sanwaldi) and one species of the P. breviceps group (P. mexicanus), and compared these with the previously identified sex pheromone of P. topoffi of the P. breviceps group. We then used sex pheromone blends reconstructed from synthesized components of the two groups to test their efficacy at reproductively isolating these species. We found that methyl 6-methylsalicylate is conserved as the major component of the pheromone blends for both Polyergus species groups; however, methyl (R)-3-ethyl-4-methylpentanoate is the species-specific minor component produced by P. lucidus group queens, and (R)-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-1-ol is the crucial minor component for P. breviceps group queens. The optimal ratio of the major and minor components for P. lucidus group queens was about 100:1 salicylate to ester. In concurrent field trials in Missouri, males of P. lucidus sensu stricto and P. mexicanus (a member of the P. breviceps group) were attracted almost exclusively to their particular blends of sex pheromone components. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a possible sex-pheromone-based reproductive isolating mechanism in ants.	[Greenberg, Les; McElfresh, J.

Recent speciation in restricted geographic area without obvious ecological barriers prompts the question of the behavioural mechanisms underlying species divergence. In this context, we investigated phylogenetic relationships in the Cataglyphis albicans desert ant complex in Israel. We first determined accurate species delimitation using two mitochondrial and six nuclear genes, as well as 11 microsatellite markers to investigate cryptic species in this group, assessing reduction in gene flow between populations. We then investigated whether different species in this group exhibit distinct reproductive strategies, inferring social structure and queen-mating frequency in each species uncovered. Our findings highlight the presence of at least six distinct Cataglyphis albicans species in the restricted range of Israel; four of them co-occur in a 50 x 50 km area in North Negev, while two are endemic from there. However, our results reveal incongruences between nuclear and mitochondrial clustering, which complicate species identification and preclude the exclusive use of mtDNA to confidently delimit species in this group. Finally, we show that the different species of the C. albicans group in Israel exhibit quite similar reproductive strategies with most of them having colonies headed by a single queen mated with several males; colonies of one species were, however, headed by several queens. Overall, this weak variation across species thereby unlikely represents the main evolutionary force behind speciation of these sympatric species. We then discuss the potential evolutionary processes that underlie speciation in this group in the absence of clear geographical or ecological barriers.

Assortative mating in space and time: patterns and biases	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Review						Assortative pairing; mate assortment; mate choice; repeatability; spatial scale; temporal scale	MUTUAL MATE CHOICE; SEXUAL SELECTION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; BODY-SIZE; TEMPORAL VARIATION; MALE COMPETITION; PRACTICAL GUIDE; SPECIATION; DENSITY; SCALE	Despite the important roles of assortative mating for understanding evolutionary processes, our knowledge on the variation in assortative mating across populations and breeding periods has been overshadowed by the greater attention given to general patterns. Obtaining data on mating pairs are difficult for most species; therefore, researchers often group data from different populations or breeding periods, which can increase positive biases in detecting and estimating assortative mating. We used a meta-analytic approach to investigate the biases caused by spatially or temporally pooling data and the assortative mating consistency across populations and breeding periods. We describe assortative mating patterns across and within animal taxa. We performed a systematic review to search studies reporting measures of size-assortative mating (SAM). Grouping data from multiple populations and seasons incurred positive biases. Overall, assortative mating moderately exhibited low repeatability in space and time, but it was inconsistent for most taxa. After excluding pooled measures, the average estimate for assortative mating was moderate and positive. Thus, our findings demonstrate that pooling data can produce misleading results. We also highlight the importance of further investigation of hypotheses that explain spatial and temporal variation in assortative mating, after its detection. Our study reinforces the significance of investigating mating patterns at various spatial and temporal scales before drawing broad conclusions.

Up to four strains co-occurred in a single ant. Most strains occurred in two clusters (InvA and InvB), but the social parasite Acromyonex insinuator hosted two additional infections. The multiple Wolbachia strains may influence the expression of reproductive conflicts in leafcutter ants, but the expected turnover of infections may make the cumulative effects on host ant reproduction complex. The additional Wolbachia infections of the social parasite A. insinuator were almost certainly acquired by horizontal transmission, but may have facilitated reproductive isolation from its closely related host.

Large queens participate mainly in mating flights and found new colonies independent of their mother colony. In contrast, small queens do not found new colonies independently, but seek readoption into their natal nest which results in multiple-queen colonies (polygyny). Populations differ strongly in the ratio of small to large queens, the prevalent reproductive tactic and colony social structure, according to ecological parameters such as nest site stability and population density. This study compares the genetic structure of two strongly differing populations within the same mountain range. Data from microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA give no evidence for alien reproductives in polygynous colonies. The incidence of alien workers in colonies (as determined by mitochondrial haplotype) was low and did not differ between monogynous and polygynous colonies. We found significant population viscosity (isolation-by-distance) at the mitochondrial level in only the predominantly polygynous population, which supports the theoretical prediction that female philopatry leads to mtDNA-specific population structure. Nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversity was similar in both populations. The genetic differentiation between the two investigated populations was moderate at the mitochondrial level, but not significantly different from zero when measured with microsatellites, which corroborates limited dispersal of females (but not males) at a larger scale.

Dispersal and mating in a size-dimorphic ant	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Ants; Dispersal; Mating behaviour; Nuptial flight; Size morph	ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS; WESTERN HARVESTER ANT; MYRMICA-RUGINODIS; BODY-SIZE; SEXUAL SELECTION; LIFE-HISTORIES; GENE FLOW; POPULATION; HYMENOPTERA; EVOLUTION	Alternative reproductive strategies linked to size are often connected with differences in dispersal and mating behaviour. Temporal and spatial mating isolation of different sized individuals can lead to size-assortative mating, which may maintain intraspecific size polymorphism. In the size-dimorphic ant Myrmica ruginodis, newly produced sexuals of the larger macrogyne morph join nuptial flights to mate, but mating behaviour of the smaller microgyna females remains elusive and even less is known about males. In this study, we examined the differences in dispersal strategies of the two size morphs as a possible mechanism causing reproductive isolation between them. We developed a new method for sampling sexuals dispersing from their nests, and sampled also mating couples and random males from a nearby mating site. We studied propensity and timing of dispersal and assortative mating of the size morphs based on their expected and observed participation in the nuptial flight. Our study shows that predominantly, macrogynes participate in the nuptial flight, while microgynes stay close to their natal nest. However, dispersal is not associated with male size, and larger males, preferred by all females, are available for both morphs. Size-assortative mating, mainly caused by macrogynes mating with large males, exists at the nuptial flight and should promote mating isolation of the size morphs, but microgynes counterbalance this to a certain degree by mating with large males. Size-associated alternative dispersal strategies in size polymorphic species provide insight into the mechanisms enhancing genetic divergence, a potential early step in the speciation process. We studied the association between size and dispersal in the size-dimorphic ant Myrmica ruginodis, to evaluate potential premating isolation between the morphs. To date, there is a shortage of studies on mating and dispersal behaviour of ants in natural settings. We captured dispersing sexuals from their natal nests, separating those dispersing on foot or by flight-a technique never applied to dispersing ants before-and assessed mate selection at the mating swarm. We found that dispersal propensity depends on the size of the females (but not males) so that the larger macrogyne morph joins a nuptial flight and the smaller microgyne morph rarely does. Furthermore, macrogyna females actively choose to mate with large males causing size-assortative mating, creating partial mating isolation between the size morphs and opening a possibility for genetic divergence between the morphs.

Native bees are negatively affected by agricultural intensification, isolation from natural habitats, decreases in plant diversity, and reduction in the availability of nesting sites. Despite this, in the Pampean region, there are scarce studies about the effect of agricultural activities on native bees. We studied the nesting ecology of the native leafcutter bee Megachile gomphrenoides (Megachilidae) in eight sites immersed in an agricultural matrix, where land use is a mosaic of agricultural land and some semi-natural areas. The sampling was developed using paired trap-nests in fragments without agricultural management and in soybean crops. We aimed to analyse the effects of floral and nesting resources on the abundance, the reproductive success and the parasitism rate of a population of M. gomphrenoides in a Pampean agroecosystem. Floral diversity was significantly correlated with abundance of nests and brood cells, and both parasitism rate and reproductive success of M. gomphrenoides were higher in nests built in fragments without agricultural management when compared to crop areas. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between reproductive success and flower diversity in crop areas. These results suggest that floral diversity is limiting the abundance of M. gomphrenoides nests, its reproductive success as well as its parasitism rate.

Ant social parasites and their hosts are often close relatives (Emery's rule), and two main hypotheses compete to explain the parasites' evolutionary origins: (1) the interspecific hypothesis proposes an allopatric speciation scenario for the parasite, whereas (2) the intraspecific hypothesis postulates that the parasite evolves directly from its host in sympatry [1-10]. Evidence in support of the intraspecific hypothesis has been accumulating for ants [3, 5, 7, 9-12], but sympatric speciation remains controversial as a general speciation mechanism for inquiline parasites. Here we use molecular phylogenetics to assess whether the socially parasitic fungus-growing ant Mycocepurus castrator speciated from its host Mycocepurus goeldii in sympatry. Based on differing patterns of relationship in mitochondrial and individual nuclear genes, we conclude that host and parasite occupy a temporal window in which lineage sorting has taken place in the mitochondrial genes but not yet in the nuclear alleles. We infer that the host originated first and that the parasite originated subsequently from a subset of the host species' populations, providing empirical support for the hypothesis that inquiline parasites can evolve reproductive isolation while living sympatrically with their hosts.

Population differentiation in female sex pheromone and male preferences in a solitary bee	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Colletes cunicularius; population differentiation; odour preferences; Ophrys orchids; pollination by sexual deception	CACTOPHILIC DROSOPHILA-MOJAVENSIS; COLLETES-CUNICULARIUS HYMENOPTERA; SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; CUTICULAR HYDROCARBONS; PREMATING ISOLATION; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; MATING PREFERENCES; MATE CHOICE; SELECTION; MOTH	Population differentiation in female mating signals and associated male preferences can drive reproductive isolation among segregated populations. We tested this assumption by investigating intraspecific variation in female sex pheromone and associated male odour preferences among distant populations in the solitary bee Colletes cunicularius (L.) by using quantitative gas chromatography and by performing field bioassays with synthetic blends of key sex pheromone compounds. We found significant differences in sex pheromone blends among the bee populations, and the divergence in odour blends correlated positively with geographic distance, suggesting that genetic divergence among distant populations can affect sex pheromone chemistry. Our behavioural experiments, however, demonstrate that synthetic copies of allopatric female sex pheromones were cross-attractive to patrolling males from distant populations, making reproductive isolation by non-recognition of mating signals among populations unlikely. Our data also show that patrolling male bees from different populations preferred odour types from allopatric populations at the two sites of bioassays. These male preferences are not expected to select for changes in the female sex pheromone, but may influence the evolution of floral odour in sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys that are pollinated by C. cunicularius males.

J	Giehr, J; Heinze, J				Giehr, Julia; Heinze, Juergen			Queens stay, workers leave: caste-specific responses to fatal infections in an ant	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Altruism; self-removal; lethal infection; disease management; Terminal investment; Ants; Temnothorax	DISEASE RESISTANCE; GROUP FACILITATION; COLONY STRUCTURE; HYMENOPTERA; REPRODUCTION; BEHAVIOR; INSECT; FORMICIDAE; DOMINANCE; FITNESS	BackgroundThe intense interactions among closely related individuals in animal societies provide perfect conditions for the spread of pathogens. Social insects have therefore evolved counter-measures on the cellular, individual, and social level to reduce the infection risk. One striking example is altruistic self-removal, i.e., lethally infected workers leave the nest and die in isolation to prevent the spread of a contagious disease to their nestmates. Because reproductive queens and egg-laying workers behave less altruistically than non-laying workers, e.g., when it comes to colony defense, we wondered whether moribund egg-layers would show the same self-removal as non-reproductive workers. Furthermore, we investigated how a lethal infection affects reproduction and studied if queens and egg-laying workers intensify their reproductive efforts when their residual reproductive value decreases (terminal investment).ResultsWe treated queens, egg-laying workers from queenless colonies, and non-laying workers from queenright colonies of the monogynous (single-queened) ant Temnothorax crassispinus either with a control solution or a solution containing spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum. Lethally infected workers left the nest and died away from it, regardless of their reproductive status. In contrast, infected queens never left the nest and were removed by workers only after they had died. The reproductive investment of queens strongly decreased after the treatment with both, the control solution and the Metarhizium brunneum suspension. The egg laying rate in queenless colonies was initially reduced in infected colonies but not in control colonies. Egg number increased again with decreasing number of infected workers.ConclusionsQueens and workers of the ant Temnothorax crassispinus differ in their reaction to an infection risk and a reduced life expectancy. Workers isolate themselves to prevent contagion inside the colony, whereas queens stay in the nest. We did not find terminal investment; instead it appeared that egg-layers completely shut down egg production in response to the lethal infection. Workers in queenless colonies resumed reproduction only after all infected individuals had died, probably again to minimize the risk of infecting the offspring.

We examined the occurrence of worker conflicts in groups of workers either with or without the queen. Intranidal aggression was observed in each nest for 10 min each day, and the immatures produced were counted once a week for two months. Pairs of workers involved in aggression were taken regularly from each nest and used for chemical, morphological and anatomical analyses. The attacker and the attacked workers differed in their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. The attacker and the attacked ants were at the same middle-aged fertile stage. The attacker ant was significantly larger and more fertile than the attacked ant, and more mature physiologically (poison gland was darker). There was apparently no stable hierarchy between laying workers. In the first weeks under queenless conditions, most eggs and larvae were destroyed, but they were later reared to obtain males. The intranidal worker aggression in this highly evolved ant is discussed in relation to dominance and worker policing.

For the first time, we report their independent expression of complete cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in a coinfected host, and CI in a species of the haplodiploid insect order Thysanoptera. In Pezothrips kellyanus, Cardinium-induced CI resulted in a combination of male development (MD) and embryonic female mortality (FM) of fertilized eggs. In contrast, Wolbachia-induced CI resulted in FM together with postembryonic mortality not previously reported as a CI outcome. Both endosymbionts appeared to not influence fecundity but virgins produced more offspring than mated females. In coinfected individuals, Wolbachia density was higher than Cardinium. Wolbachia removal did not impact Cardinium density, suggesting a lack of competition within hosts. Maternal transmission was complete for Wolbachia and high for Cardinium. Our data support theoretical predictions and empirical detection of high endosymbiont prevalence in field populations of the native range of this pest thrips. However, previous findings of more frequent loss of Wolbachia than Cardinium, particularly in field populations of the host's invasive range, suggest that genetic diversity or varying environmental factors between field populations also play a role in shaping host-endosymbiont dynamics.

Strong, but incomplete, mate choice discrimination between two closely related species of paper wasp	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						mate choice; Polistes; social insects; speciation	HYMENOPTERA; VESPIDAE; BEHAVIOR; EVOLUTION; MALES; SEX; COMPETITION; LANDMARKS; SELECT; SIZE	Paper wasps (genus Polistes) are one of the most species-rich genera of social insect. Prior studies have found that male coloration, male colour pattern, territory choice and female caste are potential drivers of intraspecific mate choice in paper wasps. However, there has been no formal assessment of interspecific mate choice in this group; therefore, the mechanism driving diversification in paper wasps remains an open question. In this study, we measured interspecific and intraspecific mating behaviour between two closely related species of paper wasps, Polistes fuscatus and Polistes metricus. These two species have ample opportunity to interbreed because P. fuscatus and P. metricus forage, nest and mate in the same habitats. We tested the strength of reproductive isolation between these species using no-choice and choice mating trials. Our results show strong, symmetric, prezygotic isolation between P. fuscatus and P. metricus. Males discriminated between conspecifics and heterospecifics but attempted to mate with females of the other species in similar to 10% of heterospecific mating trials. Female wasps were more discriminating than males and probably evaluated species identity and male quality through visual or olfactory cues. We additionally report sexual dimorphism in P. metricus body size.

Maintenance of specificity in an isolated fig	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						Agaonidae; coevolution; Ficus; host specificity; seed predator-pollinator	HOST-SPECIFICITY; FICUS; WASPS; POLLINATOR; MUTUALISM; AGAONIDAE; WORLD; HYBRIDIZATION; HYMENOPTERA; BREAKDOWN	The obligate interaction between figs and their pollinating wasps is often cited as an extraordinary example of reciprocal species specificity and evolutionary cospeciation. However, recent studies have shown that breakdowns in one-to-one specificity are not rare (30-60% of species depending on the locality). Combined with evidence of hybridization in some species, this led researchers to propose that a better evolutionary model was one of groups of genetically well-defined pollinators coevolving with groups of frequently hybridizing figs. Nevertheless, these recent studies still indicate that a majority of fig species have one or more host-specific pollinator. The extent to which specificity barriers in these species are leaky will have important consequences for the evolutionary process in Ficus. At Lambir Hills N.P., Sarawak, a single individual of Ficus acamptophylla has become recently isolated from conspecifics through clearance of its specialized habitat, but adjacent forest has a diverse fig flora, including 16 species with congeneric pollinators. Thus, when this individual flowered I was able to investigate the maintenance of its specificity barriers in the absence of competition from the normal pollinator. Only 1 percent of inflorescences were entered by a single pollinator species, which had very low reproductive success, and no viable seeds were produced. Nonpollinating wasps also failed to reproduce in any of the inflorescences. These results indicate the maintenance of strict specificity barriers in this fig individual.

However, how group living animals dispose of waste has not attracted much attention. Schizotetranychus miscanthi Saito is a social spider mite infesting a perennial grass (Miscanthus sinensis Anderss), in which all nest members tend to defecate at specific sites. We investigated the mechanisms by which the individuals select the site of defecation. The results show that nest members defecate at only one site inside the nest, and that waste management is maintained by two simple rules. First, mites defecate near the nest entrances if no volatile chemical cues are available, and secondly, when chemical cues are available from feces deposited previously, they defecate at this site. We discuss the adaptive significance of these mechanisms, as well as their role in the evolution of sociality in mites.

Asymmetric sharing of pollinator fig wasps between two sympatric dioecious fig trees: a reflection of supply and demand or differences in the size of their figs?	BOTANICAL STUDIES			English	Article						Host specificity; Hybrid; Mutualism; Pollinator sharing; Size-matching	HYMENOPTERA CHALCIDOIDEA; FICUS; AGAONIDAE; SPECIFICITY; EVOLUTION; MUTUALISM; DIVERSIFICATION; DIVERGENCE; PHENOLOGY; BREAKDOWN	Background Host specificity among pollinator fig wasps (Agaonidae) depends on host plant specific volatile cues, but fig wasps must also pass through a narrow physical barrier (the ostiole) if they are to pollinate and oviposit. Across South East Asia the dioecious shrub Ficus hirta is associated with at least ten pollinator species allied to Valisia javana. Ficus triloba has a single recorded pollinator, Valisia esquirolianae. Receptive figs of F. hirta are usually much smaller than those of F. triloba, but at a mainland site where F. hirta has atypically large figs we identified both V. esquirolianae and V. javana from both Ficus species using COI and ITS2 sequencing. To investigate whether this host overlap was exceptional we reared fig wasps from the two trees elsewhere and recorded features that may facilitate host transfer between them, including attractant volatiles, reproductive phenology and the sizes of their figs and fig wasps. Results The two Ficus species were found to support both Valisia species at several of the sites, suggesting that the differences we detected in volatile profiles, ostiole sizes and pollinator head sizes are not strict barriers to host sharing. Valisia javana colonised F. triloba more frequently than V. esquirolianae colonised F. hirta. Conclusions This asymmetric sharing of pollinators may reflect the relative abundance of the two species of fig wasps and differences in host reproductive phenology. Asynchronous flowering of individual F. hirta may favor local retention of pollinators, in contrast to the tree-wide synchrony of F. triloba figs, which can generate local shortages of V. esquirolianae. If the pollinator sharing by male figs of F. triloba and F. hirta also occurs in female figs then this could result in gene flow between them.

Ropalidia marginata is a primitively eusocial wasp that shows both post-imaginal regulation of reproductive division of labor as well as age polyethism. Hence, R.marginata is a particularly interesting model system to study the effect of juvenile hormone. We demonstrate here that a single, topical application of 100 mug of juvenile hormone-III per female wasp accelerates ovarian development of wasps held in isolation. Similar application to wasps released back on to their natal nests has no effect on their rate of behavioral development as witnessed from the age of first performance of feed larva, build, bring pulp and bring food. We conclude therefore that in R.marginata, juvenile hormone has retained its function of modulating reproductive division of labor and has not acquired the function of modulating age polyethism.

Evolutionary relationships among pollinators and repeated pollinator sharing in sexually deceptive orchids	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						convergent evolution; phylogenetics; pollination; sexual deception; specialization; speciation	THYNNINE WASPS HYMENOPTERA; SPECIALIZED POLLINATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; CALADENIA ORCHIDACEAE; BEES HYMENOPTERA; CHEMICAL ECOLOGY; FLORAL ISOLATION; DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY; CONSERVATION	The mechanism of pollinator attraction is predicted to strongly influence both plant diversification and the extent of pollinator sharing between species. Sexually deceptive orchids rely on mimicry of species-specific sex pheromones to attract their insect pollinators. Given that sex pheromones tend to be conserved among related species, we predicted that in sexually deceptive orchids, (i) pollinator sharing is rare, (ii) closely related orchids use closely related pollinators and (iii) there is strong bias in the wasp lineages exploited by orchids. We focused on species that are pollinated by sexual deception of thynnine wasps in the distantly related genera Caladenia and Drakaea, including new field observations for 45 species of Caladenia. Specialization was extreme with most orchids using a single pollinator species. Unexpectedly, seven cases of pollinator sharing were found, including two between Caladenia and Drakaea, which exhibit strikingly different floral morphology. Phylogenetic analysis of pollinators using four nuclear sequence loci demonstrated that although orchids within major clades primarily use closely related pollinator species, up to 17% of orchids within these clades are pollinated by a member of a phylogenetically distant wasp genus. Further, compared to the total diversity of thynnine wasps within the study region, orchids show a strong bias towards exploiting certain genera. Although these patterns may arise through conservatism in the chemical classes used in sex pheromones, apparent switches between wasp clades suggest unexpected flexibility in floral semiochemical production. Alternatively, wasp sex pheromones within lineages may exhibit greater chemical diversity than currently appreciated.	[Phillips, R. D.; Hayes, C.; Linde, C.

Hybridization and subsequent introgression appear widespread along the tree of life. However, our understanding of how distinct evolutionary forces shape admixed genomes and the fate of introgressed genetic variants remains scarce. Most admixture research in animals has focused on diploid organisms. Wepropose that haplodiploid organisms can help resolve open questions about the genomic consequences of hybridization in natural populations. The ploidy difference between haploid males and diploid females, the availability of genome-wide male haplotypes, and ongoing cases of admixture make haplodiploid organisms promising models to improve our knowledge with regards to the evolution of hybrid genomes.

Here we investigated the role of two pre- and two postzygotic mechanisms of RI in a system comprising two interdependent Pogonomyrmex harvester ant lineages (the H1 and H2 lineages) of hybrid origin and one of their parental species (P. rugosus). Similar to most other ants, P. rugrosus is characterized by an environmental system of caste determination with female brood developing either into queens or workers depending on nongenetic factors. By contrast, there is a strong genetic component to caste determination in the H1 and H2 lineages because the developmental fate of female brood depends on the genetic origin of the parents, with interlineage eggs developing into workers and intralineage eggs developing into queens. The study of a mixed mating aggregation revealed strong differences in mating flight timing between R rugosus and the two lineages as a first mechanism of RI. A second important prezygotic mechanism was assortative mating. Laboratory experiments also provided support for one of the two investigated mechanisms of postzygotic isolation. The majority of offspring produced from the few matings between R rugrosus and the lineages aborted at the egg stage. This hybrid inviability was under maternal influence, with hybrids produced by P. rugosus queens being always inviable whereas a small proportion of H2 lineage queens produced large numbers of adult hybrid offspring. Finally, we found no evidence that genetic caste determination acted as a second postzygotic mechanism reducing gene flow between P rugosus and the H lineages. The few viable P. rugosus-H hybrids were not preferentially shunted into functionally sterile workers but developed into both workers and queens. Overall, these results reveal that the nearly complete (99.5%) RI between R rugosus and the two hybrid lineages stems from the combination of two typical prezygotic mechanisms (mating time divergence and assortative mating) and one postzygotic mechanism (hybrid inviability).

Screened cages, inside a greenhouse, containing Citrus limon (L,) trees were used. Mating compatibility was determined using the index of sexual isolation. Most of the populations were noncompatible with each other and thus sexually isolated. Of these, Tucuman (Argentina) and Piracicaba (Brazil) populations showed a lower degree of isolation, whereas the other tested combinations were highly isolated. Full mating compatibility was detected only between two Argentinean (Concordia and Tucuman) and two Peruvian populations (La Molina and Piura + La Molina). Flies were sexually active at different times: Tucuman, Concordia, and Piracicaba populations presented an early morning peak, La Molina and Piura + La Molina were active around midday, and Ibague (Colombia) were active late in the afternoon. Manipulation of light phase conditions to match the times of maximum sexual activity did not increase the compatibility between La Molina and Tucuman. Based on these behavioral results, which confirm morphometric, genetic, and other evidence, the taxonomic revision of this cryptic species complex is warranted. One practical implication is that colonies of this pest to be used in any sterile insect technique approach should be derived from the target population or from a compatible population. Regional efforts should be initiated to determine the distribution of each subgroup and their relationship with each other in terms of compatibility.

Forests do not limit bumble bee foraging movements in a montane meadow complex	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Central place foraging; foraging range; genetic mark-recapture; habitat connectivity; movement ecology; pollinators	LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; ANIMAL MOVEMENT; NEST DENSITY; LAND-USE; BOMBUS; DISPERSAL; BARRIERS; RANGE; CONNECTIVITY	1. Understanding the roles of habitat fragmentation and resource availability in shaping animal movement are integral for promoting species persistence and conservation. For insects such as bumble bees, their movement patterns affect the survival and reproductive potential of their colonies, as well as the pollen flow of plant species. However, the understanding of their mobility or the impact of putative barriers in natural environments is limited due to the technical difficulties of studying wild populations. 2. Genetic mark-recapture was used to estimate the foraging distance, resource use, and site connectivity of two bumble bee species in a montane meadow complex composed of open meadows within a matrix of forest. 3. There was no evidence that forests or changes in landcover function as barriers to the fine-scale movement for either species. Substantially greater colony-specific foraging distances were found for Bombus vosnesenskii (maximum: 1867 m) compared to Bombus bifarius (maximum: 362 m). Despite this difference in absolute range, both species were detected across putative forest barriers at frequencies expected by uninhibited movement. Siblings separated by greater distances were more likely to be foraging on different floral species, potentially suggesting a resource-based motivation for movement. 4. These results suggest that bumble bee foraging patterns are influenced by species-specific differences in movement capacity, with little influence of matrix composition between resource patches. They also support the perspective that habitat conservation for bumble bees should prioritise providing abundant and diverse patches of resources within species-specific movement radii with less emphasis on matrix composition.

Phylogeography in Response to Reproductive Strategies and Ecogeographic Isolation in Ant Species on Madagascar: Genus Mystrium (Formicidae: Amblyoponinae)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; DEPENDENT COLONY FOUNDATION; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; PHYLOGENY; PATTERNS; DIVERSIFICATION; SYSTEMATICS; DIVERSITY; ENDEMISM	The bulk of models used to understand the species diversification on Madagascar have been constructed using vertebrate taxa. It is not clear how these models affect less vagile species that may interact at a variety of spatial scales. Several studies on vertebrates have divided Madagascar into east-west bioclimatic regions, suggesting there is a fundamental division between eastern wet-adapted and western dry-adapted taxa. An alternative model of ecogeographic constraints shows a north-south division. We test whether the diversification in a small arthropod with variable degrees of dispersal conform to either model of ecogeographic constraints proposed for vertebrate taxa. We employ a molecular taxonomic dataset using similar to 2 kilobases nuDNA (Wg, LW Rh, Abd-A, 28s) and 790 basepairs mtDNA (CO1), along with geographic and habitat data, to examine the diversification patterns of the ant genus Mystrium Roger, 1862, (Subfamily Amblyoponinae) from Madagascar. The nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies were both congruent with morphospecies as indicated in a recent revision of the genus. Species of Mystrium practice different colony reproductive strategies (winged queens vs non-winged queens). Alternate reproductive strategies led to inequalities in female dispersal ability among species, providing an additional layer for examination of the impacts of vagility on divergence, especially when measured using a maternally inherited locus. Mystrium species distribution patterns support these models of ecogeographic constraints. Reproductive strategy effected how Mystrium mtDNA lineages were associated with large-scale habitat distinctions and various topographical features. Furthermore, in some cases we find microgeographic population structure which appears to have been impacted by localized habitat differences (tsingy limestone formations, littoral forest) on a scale much smaller than that found in vertebrates. The current system offers a finer scale look at species diversification on the island, and helps achieve a more universal understanding of the generation of biodiversity on Madagascar.

Mating isolation between the ant Myrmica rubra and its microgynous social parasite	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Hybridization; Inquilinism; Reproductive isolation; Male production; Myrmica microrubra; Sympatric speciation	SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; HYMENOPTERA; HOST; HYM; DIVERGENCE; DNA; POLYMORPHISM; FORMICIDAE; INQUILINE	Sympatric speciation has been suggested for several pairs of social parasites and their hosts. Little is known, however, about how they have become reproductively isolated from each other. The ant Myrmica rubra has an intraspecific microgynous social parasite, which is probably speciating from its macrogynous host morph. Mating of the host and parasite is suggested to be spatially isolated, microgynes mating in the nest and macrogynes usually joining mating swarms. The mating biology of the microgyne is, however, still poorly known. We studied mating isolation and potential gene flow between these morphs by assessing whether host males are produced in naturally parasitized nests, and by testing experimentally cross-mating of the morphs when brought together. Both parasite and host males mated with both female morphs, but host males seemed to mate more often than the parasite males with their own kind. Although most males in the parasitized nests were produced by the parasites, the host queens and workers also produced some males, thus providing the morphs an opportunity for cross-mating. Previous studies have shown, however, that genetic divergence between sympatric parasite and host populations is substantial, which indicates that hybridization is rare. This implies that even if cross-mating between the morphs took place in the wild, introgression would be weak. Our results, together with earlier studies, indicate that the parasite and host of M. rubra are not fully reproductively isolated, even though gene flow between the morphs is restricted enough to allow ongoing speciation of the parasite.

The accumulated chemicals are later emitted during courtship display, presumably to lure conspecific females for mating. We analyzed tibial fragrances of males of 15 sympatric Panamanian species in the genus Euglossa to test whether communities of euglossine bees are chemically structured, and to elucidate whether male fragrance signals evolve to convey premating isolation. Our analysis revealed substantial chemical disparity among all lineages. Disparity was mediated by compounds that were exclusive to certain species but also by differences in relative quantity of shared compounds. We mapped tibial fragrance compounds present in each species on a DNA-based phylogeny (reconstructed using partial sequences of COI, EF1-alpha, ArgK, and Pol-II) and found that most dominant compounds were highly homoplasious. In an analysis of chemical differentiation in relation to phylogenetic divergence through time, disparity was greater than expected from a null model at any point during evolutionary history, suggesting that diversifying selection has shaped fragrance phenotypes. Notably, chemical disparity was greater within recently diverged lineages than among them, suggesting that chemical preferences in orchid bees evolved rapidly in the early stages of species divergence. We postulate communication interference as the possible mechanism behind the observed fragrance differentiation, which may be the product of reproductive character (fragrance) displacement. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that male fragrance signals evolve to convey premating isolation.

Tegmina-size variation in a Neotropical cricket with implications on spectral song properties	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						Bioacoustics; geometric morphometrics; Grylloidea; Pantanal wetlands	SOUND PRODUCTION; FIELD CRICKET; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; APIS-MELLIFERA; CALLING SONGS; ORTHOPTERA; SHAPE; HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE; FREQUENCY	This study evaluates the relationship between shape and size of tegmen, harp, mirror, and spectral range of calling song frequency of a Neotropical cricket subpopulation (Lerneca inalata beripocone. In addition, we compare intraspecific morphological divergence and calling song properties between individuals from different sites of the Pantanal of Pocone, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Regression analysis showed that the dominant and maximum calling song frequencies were negatively correlated with tegmen size, i.e. frequencies are either lower or higher depending on the corresponding size variation in resonance structures of the forewings. Canonical variable analysis demonstrated marked intraspecific differences in morphometric characters between localities of a L. inalata subpopulation c. 35km apart (SESC-Pantanal Advanced Research Base and Pouso Alegre Farm, Mato Grosso, Brazil). Lerneca inalata beripocone at SESC had larger forewings than conspecifics from Pouso Alegre Farm. These morphological variations of wing properties related to reproductive behaviours were interpreted as fitness parameters, likely shaped by restricted gene flow during temporal habitat isolation episodes. Such isolation patterns occur in the Pantanal wetlands for several months during the annual hydrological cycle.

Worker laying in leafcutter ant Acromyrmex subterraneus brunneus (Formicidae, Attini)	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						leafcutter ant; queenless ant colonies; reproduction conflict; worker laying; worker reproduction	1911 HYM.; FOREL; HYMENOPTERA	We studied the process of offspring production in queenless colonies of Acromyrmex subterraneus brunneus, and particularly evaluated the ovary development of workers as a function of their age. For this, subcolonies were set up and evaluated at different periods of isolation from the queen (2, 4 and 6 months), besides individually labeled age groups. The subcolonies were assessed according to offspring production and ovaries containing oocytes or not. The evaluations showed worker oviposition and development of males originating from worker-laid eggs. At 2 months'absence of the queen, eggs and larvae were found, with eggs in a higher proportion than larvae. After 4 months, the proportion of eggs had reduced while larvae had increased, and a pupa was found in one subcolony. At 6 months, besides a higher share of larvae, one pupa and one adult male were found. Dissection of workers revealed ovaries containing oocytes during the periods of evaluation. Only a group of medium-sized and large workers, 23.3%, 20.9% and 37.5% of the population from each period assessed in queenless subcolonies respectively, presented developed oocytes in the ovary. The same was observed in colonies with a queen, with 17.6%, 19.6% and 7.8% of the group of dissected workers from each time period, respectively. With respect to worker age, we observed by dissection of the ovary, that the greatest percentage of individuals with ovarioles containing oocytes occurred at 45 days (6 weeks) up to 90 days (12 weeks). These results probably are associated with the workers reproduction and the laying of trophic and reproductive eggs in colonies with and without a queen; these eggs have distinct functions in each situation.

The effect of the production of sons by unmated and sperm-depleted (constrained) females on sex allocation by mated females was studied in two populations of the parasitic wasp Bracon hebetor over 3 years. B. hebetor females who depleted their sperm reserves from prior matings rarely remated and became constrained to produce only sons. Constrained females readily oviposited and produced clutches similar in size to those produced by mated females. Although the fraction of constrained females in the population varied considerably between sites and sampling dates, it was usually high enough to favor the production of female-biased sex ratios by mated females. Mated females consistently produced female-biased sex ratios. However, we found no evidence that the sex ratios produced by mated females from the field shifted in relation to the proportion of constrained females in the population. Females held with males or held in isolation also produced female-biased sex ratios. These findings suggest that, in B. hebetor, mated females produce sex ratios that reflect the average fraction of constrained females over evolutionary time.

Physiological variation as a mechanism for developmental caste-biasing in a facultatively eusocial sweat bee	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Megalopta genalis; social evolution; division of labour; ground plan; caste determination; vitellogenin	DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION; MEGALOPTA-GENALIS; WORKER CASTE; HONEY-BEE; MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS; ECUADORIA HYMENOPTERA; SOCIAL EVOLUTION; INSECT; WASP; VITELLOGENIN	Social castes of eusocial insects may have arisen through an evolutionary modification of an ancestral reproductive ground plan, such that some adults emerge from development physiologically primed to specialize on reproduction (queens) and others on maternal care expressed as allo-maternal behaviour (workers). This hypothesis predicts that variation in reproductive physiology should emerge from ontogeny and underlie division of labour. To test these predictions, we identified physiological links to division of labour in a facultatively eusocial sweat bee, Megalopta genalis. Queens are larger, have larger ovaries and have higher vitellogenin titres than workers. We then compared queens and workers with their solitary counterparts-solitary reproductive females and dispersing nest foundresses-to investigate physiological variation as a factor in caste evolution. Within dyads, body size and ovary development were the best predictors of behavioural class. Queens and dispersers are larger, with larger ovaries than their solitary counterparts. Finally, we raised bees in social isolation to investigate the influence of ontogeny on physiological variation. Body size and ovary development among isolated females were highly variable, and linked to differences in vitellogenin titres. As these are key physiological predictors of social caste, our results provide evidence for developmental caste-biasing in a facultatively eusocial bee.

Encarsia inaron is a parasitoid wasp that has been shown to harbour two bacterial endosymbionts, Wolbachia and Cardinium. Known then as E. partenopea, it was introduced to the USA in the late 1980s from populations collected in Italy and Israel for the biological control of an ornamental tree pest, the ash whitefly, Siphoninus phillyreae. We studied natural populations from sites in the USA, the Mediterranean and the Middle East as well as from a Cardinium-infected laboratory culture established from Italy, with the aims of characterizing these populations genetically, testing reproductive isolation, determining symbiont infection status in their native and introduced range, and determining symbiont role. The results showed that the two Encarsia populations introduced to the USA are genetically distinct, reproductively isolated, have different symbionts and different host-symbiont interactions, and can be considered different biological species. One ('E. inaron') is doubly infected by Wolbachia and Cardinium, while only Cardinium is present in the other ('E. partenopea'). The Cardinium strains in the two species are distinct, although closely related, and crossing tests indicate that the Cardinium infecting 'E. partenopea' induces cytoplasmic incompatibility. The frequency of symbiont infection found in the native and introduced range of these wasps was similar, unlike the pattern seen in some other systems. These results also lead to a retelling of a successful biological control story, with several more characters than had been initially described.

Taking into account that all multilocus haplotypes were detected, a total of 140 individuals were completely discriminated by means of 17 polymorphic markers (present or absent), which were amplified from nine selected random-decamer primers. All populations shared the same genetic types, but pronounced population-specific frequency distributions were found, indicating that on average 84% of the present genetic variation exists within populations and the remaining smaller part counts for interpopulational variation. The haplotype differentiation registered was able to distinguish between the class of lowland populations and the class of highland populations. Reproductive isolation and therefore limited altitudinal gene flow, indicated in case of a French highland population by an enlarged number of fixed markers, and hitchhiking effects with respect to selective processes at certain loci following local adaptation and speciation are discussed to explain the population structures found. A possible selection is indicated by five markers, showing significantly different frequency distributions between the class of highland populations and the class of lowland populations.

We focus on a group of newly discovered Neotropical tephritids in the genus Blepharoneura, and report the discovery of an extraordinary number of sympatric, morphologically cryptic species, all feeding as larvae on calyces of flowers of a single functionally dioecious and highly sexually dimorphic host species (Gurania spinulosa) in eastern Ecuador. Molecular analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase-I gene from flies reared from flowers of G. spinulosa reveal six distinct haplotype groups that differ by 7.2-10.1% bp (uncorrected pairwise distances; N = 624 bp). Haplotype groups correspond to six distinct and well-supported clades. Members of five clades specialize on the calyces of flowers of a particular sex: three clades comprise male flower specialists; two clades comprise female flower specialists; the sixth clade comprises generalists reared from male and female flowers. The six clades occupy significantly different morphological spaces defined by wing pigmentation patterns; however, diagnostic morphological characters were not discovered. Behavioural observations suggest specific courtship behaviours may play a role in maintaining reproductive isolation among sympatric species.

Queen Dominance May Reduce Worker Mushroom Body Size in a Social Bee	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						brain plasticity; social dominance; Halictidae	EUSOCIAL SWEAT BEE; MEGALOPTA-GENALIS HYMENOPTERA; DIVISION-OF-LABOR; CASTE DIFFERENCES; ECUADORIA HYMENOPTERA; STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY; BRAIN COMPOSITION; JUVENILE-HORMONE; VOLUME CHANGES; BODIES	The mushroom body (MB) is an area of the insect brain involved in learning, memory, and sensory integration. Here, we used the sweat bee Megalopta genalis (Halictidae) to test for differences between queens and workers in the volume of the MB calyces. We used confocal microscopy to measure the volume of the whole brain, MB calyces, optic lobes, and antennal lobes of queens and workers. Queens had larger brains, larger MB calyces, and a larger MB calyces:whole brain ratio than workers, suggesting an effect of social dominance in brain development. This could result from social interactions leading to smaller worker MBs, or larger queen MBs. It could also result from other factors, such as differences in age or sensory experience. To test these explanations, we next compared queens and workers to other groups. We compared newly emerged bees, bees reared in isolation for 10 days, bees initiating new observation nests, and bees initiating new natural nests collected from the field to queens and workers. Queens did not differ from these other groups. We suggest that the effects of queen dominance over workers, rather than differences in age, experience, or reproductive status, are responsible for the queen-worker differences we observed. Worker MB development may be affected by queen aggression directly and/or manipulation of larval nutrition, which is provisioned by the queen. We found no consistent differences in the size of antennal lobes or optic lobes associated with differences in age, experience, reproductive status, or social caste.

Exclusion techniques reveal significant biotic mortality suffered by Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) populations in Florida citrus	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL			English	Article						Asian citrus psyllid; Citrus greening; Huanglongbing; Integrated pest management; Life tables; Predation; Parasitism	BLATTELLA-ASAHINAI; KUWAYAMA HEMIPTERA; HOMOPTERA; HYMENOPTERA; PARASITISM; PREDATION; DISEASE	Management of 'huanglongbing' (HLB) or the Asian form of citrus greening disease caused by the bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, and spread by Diaphorina citri Kuwayama depends largely on the management of the vector insect. Seventeen experiments conducted during 2006-2007 included D. citri colonies initiated with eggs or first instar nymphs on young shoots protected with sleeve cages, sticky barriers or left unprotected through adult emergence to assess the relative impact of abiotic and biotic factors on psyllid populations. Temperatures dropped to 0 degrees C and killed most of the shoots and nymphs in February 2007. Spiders (Araneae) and insects in the families Coccinellidae, Blattellidae, Chrysopidae, Formicidae, Syrphidae, Anthocoridae and Miridae were observed on colonies or caught in sticky barriers. The ladybeetles Olla v-nigrum, Curinus coeruleus, Harmonia axyiidis, and Cycloneda sanguinea, the cockroach Blattella asahinai, lacewings, Ceraeochrysa sp. and Chrysoperla sp., and spiders were most often encountered. Parasitism by Tamarixia radiata provided 1-3% nymphal mortality in relation to adult emergence although a maximum of about 25% was observed. Net reproductive rate (R-0), based on observed survivorship and temperature-dependent fecundity data was estimated to be 5- to 27-fold higher in the colonies protected with full cages compared to the unprotected colonies except during the freeze. At the extreme, R-0 was estimated in caged colonies at 125-285 in Jun 2006 whereas all nymphs disappeared in the unprotected colonies. Intermediate results were observed in colonies protected with sticky barriers or coarse mesh cages. These findings suggest that biotic factors play a vital role in regulating populations of D. citri. Their elimination through reckless pesticide use could increase pest pressure and enhance the spread of the disease. Therefore, integrated control programs based on conservation of natural enemies of D. citri through judicious use of insecticides and releases of new parasitoids are needed for sustainable management of pest and disease.

Quality over quantity: unraveling the contributions to cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by two coinfecting Cardinium symbionts	HEREDITY			English	Article							REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; BACTERIAL SYMBIONT; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; PROPHAGE WO; WOLBACHIA; DROSOPHILA; SPERM; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATION; DIVERSITY	Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a common form of reproductive sabotage caused by maternally inherited bacterial symbionts of arthropods. CI is a two-step manipulation: first, the symbiont modifies sperm in male hosts which results in the death of fertilized, uninfected embryos. Second, when females are infected with a compatible strain, the symbiont reverses sperm modification in the fertilized egg, allowing offspring of infected females to survive and spread the symbiont to high frequencies in a population. Although CI plays a role in arthropod evolution, the mechanism of CI is unknown for many symbionts. Cardinium hertigii is a common CI-inducing symbiont of arthropods, including parasitoid wasps like Encarsia partenopea. This wasp harbors two Cardinium strains, cEina2 and cEina3, and exhibits strong CI. The strains infect wasps at different densities, with the cEina3 present at a lower density than cEina2, and it was previously not known which strain caused CI. By differentially curing wasps of cEina3, we found that this low-density symbiont is responsible for CI and modifies males during their pupal stage. cEina2 does not modify host reproduction and may spread by 'hitchhiking' with cEina3 CI or by conferring an unknown benefit. The cEina3 strain also shows a unique localization pattern in male reproductive tissues. Instead of infecting sperm like other CI-inducing symbionts, cEina3 cells are found in somatic cells at the testis base and around the seminal vesicle. This may allow the low-density cEina3 to efficiently modify host males and suggests that cEina3 uses a different modification strategy than sperm-infecting CI symbionts.

Previous studies suggested that the mitochondria may play an important role in this pattern of hybrid breakdown. The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 polypeptides, which are integral subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation enzyme complexes I, III, IV and V. We show that the mitochondrial ATP production rate and the efficacy of the enzyme complexes I, III and IV, but not that of the completely nuclear-encoded complex II, are reduced in F-2 hybrid males of N. giraulti and N. vitripennis. We hypothesize that nuclear-mitochondrial protein interactions in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway are disrupted in these hybrids, reducing energy generation capacity and potentially reducing hybrid fitness. Our results suggest that dysfunctional cytonuclear interactions could represent an under-appreciated post-zygotic isolation mechanism that, due to elevated evolutionary rates of mitochondrial genes, evolves very early in the speciation process.

Some studies indicate that the difference in mating behavior between winged and wingless queens may promote genetic isolation, possibly leading to speciation. However, the knowledge about genetic differences and phylogenetic relationships among polymorphic queens is limited. Queens of the myrmicine ant Vollenhovia emeryi Wheeler exhibit two morphs: a long-winged (L-queen) and a short-winged (S-queen) morph. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among populations of L- and S-queens in V. emeryi and the congeneric species V. nipponica, V. benzai, V. okinawana, and V. yambaru. The molecular phylogeny inferred from mtDNA(approximate to 2,200 nt) showed that S-queens formed a monophyletic clade and that L- and S-queens sampled from the same location did not group together. The phylogeny indicates that wing reduction occurred only once and that S-queen populations are genetically differentiated from L-queen populations, at least in their maternal genomes. The phylogeny is consistent with the hypothesis that wing reduction leads to reproductive isolation in V. emeryi.

The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the Eastern hive bee, Apis cerana, have been allopatric for millions of years, but are nonetheless similar in morphology and behaviour. During the last century, the two species were brought into contact anthropogenically, providing potential opportunities for interspecific matings. Hybrids between A.mellifera and A.cerana are inviable, so natural interspecific matings are of concern because they may reduce the viability of A.cerana and A.mellifera populations - two of the world's most important pollinators. We examined the mating behaviour of A.mellifera and A.cerana queens and drones from Caoba Basin, China and Cairns, Australia. Drone mating flight times overlap in both areas. Analysis of the spermathecal contents of queens with species-specific genetic markers indicated that in Caoba Basin, 14% of A.mellifera queens mated with at least one A.cerana male, but we detected no A.cerana queens that had mated with A.mellifera males. Similarly, in Cairns, no A.cerana queens carried A.mellifera sperm, but one-third of A.mellifera queens had mated with at least one A.cerana male. No hybrid embryos were detected in eggs laid by interspecifically mated A.mellifera queens in either location. However, A.mellifera queens artificially inseminated with A.cerana sperm produced inviable hybrid eggs or unfertilized drones. This suggests that reproductive interference will impact the viability of honeybee populations wherever A.cerana and A.mellifera are in contact.

The Potential for Gene Flow in a Dependent Lineage System of a Harvester Ant: Fair Meiosis in the F-1 Generation	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY			English	Article						gene flow; Pogonomyrmex; postzygotic selection; reproductive isolation; symmetrical social hybridogenesis; worker-produced males	CASTE DETERMINATION; QUEEN; COLONIES; HYBRIDIZATION; DETERMINANTS; MAINTENANCE; POPULATIONS; HYMENOPTERA; POLYANDRY; FREQUENCY	We investigated the potential for gene flow in a dependent lineage (DL) system of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex. Each DL system is composed of 2 reproductively isolated lineages that are locked in an obligate mutualism. The genetic components that produce the worker phenotype are acquired by hybridizing with the partner lineage. In the mating flight, queens of both lineages mate with multiple males from each lineage. During colony growth and reproduction, eggs fertilized by partner-lineage sperm produce F-1 hybrid workers with interlineage genomes, whereas eggs fertilized by same-lineage sperm result in the development of new queens with intralineage genomes. New males are typically produced from unfertilized eggs laid by the pure-lineage queen but in her absence may be produced by interlineage F-1 workers. We investigated the potential for interlineage gene flow in this system using 2 classes of lineage-specific nuclear markers to identify hybrid genome combinations. We confirmed the production of viable interlineage F-1 reproductive females in field colonies, the occurrence of which is associated with the relative frequencies of each lineage in the population: interlineage F-1 queens occurred only in the rare lineage of the population with dramatically skewed lineage frequencies. In laboratory colonies, we detected fair meiosis in interlineage F-1 workers leading to the production of viable and haploid interlineage F-2 males. We conclude that the genomes of each lineage recombine freely, suggesting that extrinsic postzygotic selection maintains the integrity of each lineage genome. We compare our findings with those of the H1/H2 DL system.

The described roles of miniaturized queens include alternative short-distance dispersal morphs, an adaptation to polygyny and inquiline parasites. Some of these inquiline parasite microgynes have been described as a separate species from their host. In the poneromorph group, miniaturized queens are only reported in two Mexican populations of two Ectatomminae: Ectatomma tuberculatum, in which small queens represent an inquiline species (Ectatomma parasiticum) and Ectatomma ruidum. E. ruidum presents apparently facultative polygyny with microgynes. We used mitochondrial DNA markers and newly developed microsatellite loci to investigate the status as well as the role of microgynes in E. ruidum. We confirmed that microgynes and macrogynes are from the same species. This species is almost exclusively monogynous and monoandrous, supernumerary dealate queens of both types being actually daughters of the mother queen. An apparently polygynous nest was more often headed by a macrogyne than a microgyne. We didn't find any inbreeding or isolation by distance in the studied population, indicating that new gynes are inseminated by unrelated males and can establish a new nest far from their natal nest. However, re-adoption of daughter queens seems to be the rule and rate of microgyny appears to be linked to nest density and environmental factors.

J	Weston, RF; Qureshi, I; Werren, JH				Weston, RF; Qureshi, I; Werren, JH			Genetics of wing size differences between two Nasonia species	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						evolutionary genetics; Nasonia; parasitic wasps; speciation; wing size	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; EVOLUTION; PTEROMALIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; ADAPTATION; GENES	Very little is known about the genetics of morphological differences between species; This study investigates the genetic basis of a significant morphological difference between males of two closely related species of the parasitoid,wasp Nasonia. One of the defining characters of species in the genus Nasonia is:male forewing size. The forewings of Nasonia giraulti males are 2.4 times larger than the forewings of Nasonia vitripennis males. Genetic analysis of hybrids between these species indicates that this difference is due to the effect of a few genes, Also discussed is the possible role of 'pseudo linkage' in analysis of F-2 hybrids, Pseudo linkage occurs when genes affecting a trait are linked to interacting hybrid lethal loci, and can lead to an;overestimation of the number of regions involved in a phenotype. The large wing trait of N. giraulti was introgressed into a N. vitripennis background. Analysis of this introgression line indicates that 44% of the difference in wing size between the species is due to the presence of a single gene, or a few tightly linked genes, located on linkage group IV. Furthermore, the introgressed region appears to affect the width of the wing more strongly than the length. Indirect results suggest that this region affects wing cell size, rather than cell number. Results are consistent with the view that morphological and adaptive differences between species can have a simple genetic:basis.

J	Seifert, B				Seifert, Bernhard			Intranidal mating, gyne polymorphism, polygyny, and supercoloniality as factors for sympatric and parapatric speciation in ants	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Distorted selection; hybridogenous speciation; social parasites; supercoloniality	LASIUS-NEGLECTUS HYMENOPTERA; INVASIVE GARDEN ANT; SPECIES HYMENOPTERA; CENTRAL-EUROPE; GENE FLOW; FORMICIDAE; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; POPULATIONS; INFERENCE	2. This idea is discussed in three cases that represent example of evolution below the species level: (1) the polygynous-polydomous form of Lasius turcicus as a model of how speciation of the supercolonial Lasius neglectus could have taken place; (2) the microgyne form of Myrmica rubra as a model for sympatric speciation of socially parasitic species; and (3) hybridisation and rapid genotype selection in supercolonial wood ants of the Formica rufa group as a model for hybrid speciation. 3. The first step of the evolutionary scenario is transition to polygyny followed by development of morpho-ethological gyne polymorphism: smaller gynes with weaker wing muscles and body reserves shift to intranidal mating and reduce dispersal flight, while larger gynes with bigger wing muscles and body reserves retain nuptial and dispersal flight. This scenario leads to mating place separation and facilitates further genotype divergence. 4. There is much less gene flow between conspecific supercolonies of Formica rufa group ants with dominance of intranidal or intracolonial mating than between conspecific monogynous colonies performing a nuptial flight. If two supercolonial species occasionally hybridise and if landscape structure provides some isolation of the resulting hybrid supercolony, very strong selection for genotypes takes place within this cohesive system of thousands of reproductive females eventually leading to novel genotypes and new species.

The probability of inbred matings within a colony in eusocial insects may depend on the timing of gyne and male emergence and on their sex ratio. In this study, we compared the development of 35 colonies of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris from founding to the emergence of the last gyne, and we investigated the probability of inbred mating in colonies with fertile newborn gynes and males. We calculated a novel colony inbreeding risk index (IRI), which considers the overlap period between fertile gynes and males, their numbers, and the colony sex ratio. We found that the IRI values were strictly correlated with the time elapsed between the gyne point and the switch point (i.e., from the moment of deposition of the first diploid egg that produces a gyne to the first haploid egg). We separated the colonies into two groups based on the mean value of the IRI: colonies with low IRI produced more gynes (93.8 +/- 9.4), for a longer period (32.1 +/- 1.8 days) and with a lower percentage of overlapped gynes (69 +/- 5%) than colonies with high IRI (57.1 +/- 21 gynes, 23.3 +/- 2.9 days, and 100% overlapped gynes, respectively). A low IRI is connected to a reduced risk of inbred mating, while colonies with a high IRI may be advantaged in conditions of isolation, in case of the absence of non-related reproducers. Inbreeding risk index proved to be a good indicator of the colony reproductive strategy.

The parasitoid wasp, Cotesia vestalis, and its host diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, provide opportunities to test whether the specialist natural enemy migrates seasonally with its host or occurs as resident population. We genotyped 17 microsatellite loci and two mitochondrial genes for 158 female adults of C.vestalis collected from 12 geographical populations, as well as nine microsatellite loci for 127 DBM larvae from six separate sites. The samplings covered both the likely source (southern) and immigrant (northern) areas of DBM from China. Populations of C.vestalis fell into three groups, pointing to isolation in northwestern and southwestern China and strong genetic differentiation of these populations from others in central and eastern China. In contrast, DBM showed much weaker genetic differentiation and high rates of gene flow. TESS analysis identified the immigrant populations of DBM as showing admixture in northern China. Genetic disconnect between C.vestalis and its host suggests that the parasitoid did not migrate yearly with its host but likely consisted of resident populations in places where its host could not survive in winter.

Winged virgin queens were removed from the pheromonal signal and placed in colony fragments. The time for dealation, degree of ovarian development, and biosynthesis rate and whole body content of juvenile hormone (JH) were measured. The production rate and content of JH were highly correlated. Dealation and the initiation of oviposition corresponded to peak production of JH. JH production rose sharply following separation from the natal nest, peaking after 3 days. After 8 days of isolation, JH production gradually subsided to levels similar to that found in pre-release queens, but began to increase again after 12 days. Mature queens had highly elevated levels of JH relative to recently dealate females, probably reflecting the increased reproductive capability of these older females. The results support the hypothesis that the pheromone released by functional queens inhibits reproduction in virgin alates by suppressing corpora allata activity and the production of JH.

The three species of the genus Forficula (Forficula auricularia L., F. decipiens Gene and F. pubescens Gene) showed distinctly gregarious behaviour in old larvae and adults in the pre-reproductive phase. This gregariousness was seen at the intraspecific lever and also among individuals of different species. The other two species, Labidura riparia Pallas and Euborellia moesta Gene, were randomly distributed over the available shelters, with no distinct tendency for aggregation or isolation. In individual tests, insects of all five species were attracted by shelters previously visited by conspecifics in preference to control shelters. For the two non-gregarious species, this phenomenon might function as a burrow marker. The same tests showed an interattractivity for four of the species studied. Only L. riparia did not respond to the trails of the four other species, although its trails were attractive to the other species, The pheromonal nature of the substances involved in the interspecific relationships and the involvement of behaviour in the biology and speciation of Dermaptera are discussed.

Recently some E. obliqua populations have been found to be resistant to the nucleopolyhedrovirus (EoNPV), a host-specific virus that has so far been found only in E. obliqua. Although the resistant populations are morphologically indistinguishable from susceptible populations, we conducted a nationwide collection and examined the genetic divergence in the COI region of the mtDNA in E. obliqua. Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA in 17 populations revealed two divergent clades with genetic distance greater than 3.7% between clades and less than 0.7% within clades. Therefore, we suggest that E. obliqua falls into two distinct groups. Further inheritance analyses using reciprocal single-pair mating showed an abnormal F-1 generation with an unbalanced sex ratio and the inability to produce fertile eggs (or any eggs) through F1 self-crossing. These data revealed a potential cryptic species complex with deep divergence and reproductive isolation within E. obliqua. Uneven distribution of the groups suggests a possible geographic effect on the divergence. Future investigations will be conducted to examine whether EoNPV selection or other factors prompted the evolution of resistance.

Sexual deception is possible because chemical rather than visual cues play the key role in wasp mate search, suggesting that cryptic wasp species may be frequent. We investigated this prospect among Neozeleboria wasp pollinators of Chiloglottis orchids, drawing on evidence from molecular phylogenetic analysis at three genes (CO1, rhodopsin and wingless), population genetic and statistical parsimony analysis at CO1, orchid associations and their semiochemicals, and geographic ranges. We found a compelling relationship between genetically defined wasp groups, orchid associations, semiochemicals and geographic range, despite a frequent lack of detectable morphological differences. Our findings reveal multiple cryptic species among orchid pollinators and indicate that chemical changes are important for wasp reproductive isolation and speciation. The diversity of Neozeleboria may have enabled, rather than constrained, pollinator-driven speciation in these orchids. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L., has been intensively studied due to its ability to evolve insecticide resistance and status as the world's most destructive pest of brassicaceous crops. The surprise discovery of a cryptic species endemic to Australia, Plutella australiana Landry & Hebert, raised questions regarding the distribution, ecological traits and pest status of the two species, the capacity for gene flow and whether specific management was required. Here, we collected Plutella from wild and cultivated brassicaceous plants from 75 locations throughout Australia and screened 1447 individuals to identify mtDNA lineages and Wolbachia infections. We genotyped genome-wide SNP markers using RADseq in coexisting populations of each species. In addition, we assessed reproductive compatibility in crossing experiments and insecticide susceptibility phenotypes using bioassays. Results: The two Plutella species coexisted on wild brassicas and canola crops, but only 10% of Plutella individuals were P. australiana. This species was not found on commercial Brassica vegetable crops, which are routinely sprayed with insecticides. Bioassays found that P. australiana was 19-306 fold more susceptible to four commonly-used insecticides than P. xylostella. Laboratory crosses revealed that reproductive isolation was incomplete but directionally asymmetric between the species. However, genome-wide nuclear SNPs revealed striking differences in genetic diversity and strong population structure between coexisting wild populations of each species. Nuclear diversity was 1.5-fold higher in P. australiana, yet both species showed limited variation in mtDNA. Infection with a single Wolbachia subgroup B strain was fixed in P. australiana, suggesting that a selective sweep contributed to low mtDNA diversity, while a subgroup A strain infected just 1.5% of P. xylostella. Conclusions: Despite sympatric distributions and the capacity to hybridize, strong genomic and phenotypic divergence exists between these Plutella species that is consistent with contrasting colonization histories and reproductive isolation after secondary contact. Although P. australiana is a potential pest of brassicaceous crops, it is of secondary importance to P. xylostella.

Four major Wolbachia groups exist: A, B (contained in divergent arthropods), C and D (harbored by Nematoda). By means of transmission electron microscopy, we observed Wolbachia-like bacteria in a primitive insect, Folsomia candida (Hexapoda, Collembola, Isotomidae), 16S rDNA analysis proved them to constitute a novel lineage, henceforth named group E, in the wolbachial phylogenetic tree. It shares 97.8% 16S rDNA homology with its nearest neighbors, groups A and B, which diverged from it more recently. We propose (i) a new taxon E for the Wolbachia strain in F. candida, (ii) that the single-described Wolbachia pipientis fall apart into at least three species: C, D and the large E-A-B complex. F. candida's group E Wolbachia rekindle the question about invasive capacities of free-living ancestral wolbachiae and horizontal transfer. (C) 1999 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The most common effect arising from the presence of Wolbachia in a population is Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI), whereby postmating reproductive isolation occurs in crosses between an infected male and an uninfected female, or when a male is infected with a different strain of Wolbachia to that of the female (bidirectional CI). Previous theoretical models have demonstrated that bidirectional CI can contribute to the genetic divergence of populations in haploid and diploid organisms. However, haplodiploid organisms were not considered in these models even though they include Nasonia parasitoid wasps - the best example of the implication of Wolbachia in ongoing speciation. Moreover, previous work did not investigate inbreeding mating systems, which are frequently observed in arthropod species. Results: We developed a stochastic two-island model which simulated three genetic scenarios, diploidy, haploidy, and haplodiploidy, with two CI phenotypes being considered for the latter: (1) male development of female progeny; and (2) mortality of fertilized eggs. We also investigated the effect of varying the proportion of sib mating. In the model each allopatric population was initially fixed for a single allele at a nuclear locus under positive selection and infected with one strain of Wolbachia. Each simulation presupposed that the two populations were fixed for a different allele and a different strain of Wolbachia. The degree of genetic differentiation observed in the locus under selection due to bidirectional CI was much lower for the two haplodiploid phenotypes than for either diploids or haploids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sib-mating may compensate for the lower efficiency of bidirectional CI in haplodiploids by maintaining genetic divergence. Conclusion: Our model suggests that maintenance of genetic differentiation facilitated by Wolbachia is more likely to occur in diploids and haploids than in haplodiploids. However, increasing the level of sib-mating may compensate for the weak effect of bidirectional CI in haplodiploids. Our work therefore gives a potential explanation for why the haplodiploid Nasonia species, which are infected with bidirectionally incompatible Wolbachia strains and undergo sib-mating, have differentiated genetically and maintained this differentiation without premating isolation.

Matings between males carrying CI-inducing Wolbachia and uninfected females, or between males and females infected with different Wolbachia strains, result in progeny that die during very early embryogenesis. Multiple studies in diploid (Drosophila) and haplodiploid (Nasonia) insects have shown that CI-Wolbachia cause a failure of the paternally derived chromatin from resolving into distinct chromosomes. This leads to the formation of chromatin bridges and other mitotic defects as early as the first mitotic division, and to early mitotic arrest. It is currently unknown if CI-inducing symbionts other than Wolbachia affect similar cellular processes. Here, we investigated CI caused by an unrelated bacterium, Cardinium, which naturally infects a parasitic wasp, Encarsia suzannae. CI crosses in this host-symbiont system resulted in early mitotic defects including asynchrony of paternal and maternal chromosome sets as they enter mitosis, chromatin bridges and improper chromosome segregation that spanned across multiple mitotic divisions, triggering embryonic death through accumulated aneuploidy. We highlight small differences with CI-Wolbachia, which could be due to the underlying CI mechanism or host-specific effects. Our results suggest a convergence of CI-related cellular phenotypes between these two unrelated symbionts.

Massive floral display affects insect visits but not pollinator-mediated pollen transfer in Rhododendron ferrugineum	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Community; Ericaceae; floral display; mass-flowering species; patch isolation; pollen transfer; visitation rate	FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; L HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; POPULATION-SIZE; SEED-SET; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SELF-FERTILIZATION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; FLOWER SIZE; DENSITY	Fragmentation of natural vegetation creates one of the largest threats to plant-pollinator interactions. Although fragmentation impacts on plant populations have been explored in many, mainly herbaceous, species, the response of wild mass-flowering species is poorly known. Here, we studied 28 heathland patches dominated by the mass-flowering shrub Rhododendron ferrugineum, each presenting different R.ferrugineum floral display sizes (total inflorescence number per patch) and patch isolation (median distance to the three nearest patches). We assessed the impacts of these two factors on (i) heathland patch visitor assemblage (considering R.ferrugineum versus surrounding community) and (ii) R.ferrugineum flower visitation rate and pollen transfer limitation (comparing seed set from emasculated to pollen-supplemented flowers). We found that diversity and abundance of bees visiting R.ferrugineum in heathland patches significantly decreased with decreasing R.ferrugineum floral display, while overall visitor density per patch and flower visitation rate increased. Moreover, a decrease in massive floral display and increase in patch isolation resulted in reduced visitor density in the surrounding community. Even in patches with few individuals, we found disproportionate visitor abundance in R.ferrugineum compared to the surrounding community. Finally, pollen transfer limitation in R.ferrugineum was neither affected by visitation rate nor by patch attributes. By disproportionally attracting pollinators from co-flowering species, and probably promoting geitonogamous pollen transfer, the mass-flowering trait appears adequate to compensate, in terms of conspecific pollen transfer, for the decrease in visitor diversity and abundance and in mate availability, which usually result from population fragmentation.

J	Cane, JH				Cane, James H.			Specialist Osmia bees forage indiscriminately among hybridizing Balsamorhiza floral hosts	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Megachilidae; Asteraceae; Hybridization; Floral constancy; Ethological mating barrier	FLOWER CONSTANCY; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; HYMENOPTERA; BEHAVIOR; SPECIFICITY; EVOLUTION; VACCINIUM; SELECTION; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY	Pollinators, even floral generalists (=polyleges), typically specialize during individual foraging bouts, infrequently switching between floral hosts. Such transient floral constancy restricts pollen flow, and thereby gene flow, to conspecific flowers in mixed plant communities. Where incipient flowering species meet, however, weak cross-fertility and often similar floral traits can yield mixed reproductive outcomes among pollinator-dependent species. In these cases, floral constancy by polyleges sometimes serves as an ethological mating barrier. More often, their foraging infidelities instead facilitate host introgression and hybridization. Many other bee species are oligolectic (taxonomic specialists for pollen). Oligoleges could be more discriminating connoisseurs than polyleges when foraging among their limited set of related floral hosts. If true, greater foraging constancy might ensue, contributing to positive assortative mating and disruptive selection, thereby facilitating speciation among their interfertile floral hosts. To test this Connoisseur Hypothesis, nesting females of two species of oligolectic Osmia bees were presented with randomized mixed arrays of flowers of two sympatric species of their pollen host, Balsamorhiza, a genus known for hybridization. In a closely spaced grid, the females of both species preferred the larger flowered B. macrophylla, evidence for discrimination. However, both species' females showed no floral constancy whatsoever during their individual foraging bouts, switching randomly between species proportional to their floral preference. In a wider spaced array in which the bouquets reflected natural plant spacing, foraging oligolectic bees often transferred pollen surrogates (fluorescent powders) both between conspecific flowers (geitonogamy and xenogamy) and between the two Balsamorhiza species. The Connoisseur Hypothesis was therefore rejected. Foraging infidelity by these oligolectic Osmia bees will contribute to introgression and hybridization where interfertile species of Balsamorhiza meet and flower together. A literature review reveals that other plant genera whose species hybridize also attract numerous oligolectic bees, providing independent opportunities to test the generality of this conclusion.

Composition of cuticular lipids in the pteromalid wasp Lariophagus distinguendus is host dependent	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						contact sex pheromone; cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs); host shift; parasitic wasp	CONTACT SEX-PHEROMONE; EMERALD ASH BORER; HYDROCARBONS; HYMENOPTERA; COLEOPTERA; COURTSHIP; BETHYLIDAE; COMPONENT; PROFILES; PATTERNS	The insect cuticle is covered by a thin layer of hydrocarbons not only preventing desiccation but also playing an important role in the sexual communication of several species. In the pteromalid wasp Lariophagus distinguendus, a parasitoid of grain infesting beetles, female cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) elicit male courtship behaviour. We analyzed the CHC profiles of male and female L. distinguendus wasps reared on different beetle hosts by coupled gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Statistical analysis of the data revealed significant differences between strains reared on different hosts, while spatially isolated strains reared on the same host produced similar profiles. CHC profiles of parasitoids reared on Stegobium paniceum were statistically distinguishable from those of wasps reared on all other hosts. A host shift from Sitophilus granarius to S. paniceum resulted in distinguishable CHC profiles of L. distinguendus females after only one generation. Considering the role of CHCs as contact sex pheromones, our data suggest that host shifts in parasitic wasps might lead to reproductive isolation of host races due to the modification of the cuticular semiocheinistry.

We examined social organization and genetic population structure in a setup where populations of the two species are sympatric and gene flow between the species is possible. Our aim was to compare social organization in the species, and study evolutionary relationships between them. The observed relatedness among colony workers suggested that the difference in the level of polygyny is quantitative rather than qualitative, with a higher queen number in F. polyctena. The observed difference in polygyny was not accompanied by a difference in spatial genetic differentiation which was weak in both species. The genetic distance between the species is consistent with limited interspecific gene flow. Identification of a few possible F. rufa migrants in F. polyctena populations suggests potential interspecific gene flow. Thus, reproductive isolation of the species may not be complete when they are sympatric.

J	Sandrock, C; Schirrmeister, BE; Vorburger, C				Sandrock, Christoph; Schirrmeister, Bettina E.; Vorburger, Christoph			Evolution of reproductive mode variation and host associations in a sexual-asexual complex of aphid parasitoids	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article							MICROSATELLITE DNA MARKERS; FITNESS TRADE-OFFS; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; THELYTOCOUS POPULATIONS; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE; DIAERETIELLA-RAPAE; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; HYMENOPTERA	Background: The Lysiphlebus fabarum group is a taxonomically poorly resolved complex of aphid parasitoids, presently split into three described species that comprise sexual (arrhenotokous) and asexual (thelytokous) lineages of unknown relationship. Specifically, it is unclear how asexuals evolved from sexuals in this system, to what extent reproductive modes are still connected by genetic exchange, how much the complex is structured by geography or by host-associated differentiation, and whether species designations are valid. Using a combination of population genetic and phylogenetic approaches, we addressed these issues in a comprehensive sample of parasitoid wasps from across Europe. Results: Asexual reproduction predominated in parasitoids of the L. fabarum group, with asexual populations exhibiting high genotypic diversity. Sexual populations were only common in southern France; elsewhere sexual reproduction was restricted to specific aphid hosts. Although reproductive modes were aggregated on the mitochondrial genealogy and significantly differentiated at nuclear microsatellite loci, there was clear evidence for genetic exchange, especially on hosts attacked by sexual and asexual parasitoids. The microsatellite data further revealed that parasitoids collected from certain host aphids were significantly differentiated, yet the mitochondrial sequence variation across the entire L. fabarum group did not exceed 1.32% and exhibited a very shallow topology. Morphological characters used for delineation of described species were found to be phylogenetically non-conservative. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the sexual-asexual L. fabarum group represents a young complex of lineages with incomplete isolation between reproductive modes. We propose three mechanisms of genetic exchange that may jointly explain the high genotypic diversity observed in asexual parasitoids: (i) the formation of new asexual lineages via 'contagious parthenogenesis', (ii) introgression from sexual lineages through matings between sexual males and thelytokous females, and (iii) 'cryptic sex' within asexuals, mediated by rare males that thelytokous lines are known to produce spontaneously. The partially strong differentiation among wasps collected from different aphids suggests that host specialization can evolve readily in these parasitoids. Finally, we conclude that in the light of our data, the current taxonomic division of the L. fabarum group into three species cannot be upheld.

Queens mate with males of their own and of the alternate lineage and produce two types of diploid offspring, those fertilized by males of the queens' lineage which develop into queens and those fertilized by males of the other lineage which develop into workers. Each of the lineages has been shown to be itself of hybrid origin between the species Pogonomyrmex barbatus and Pogonomyrmex rugosus, which both have typical, environmentally determined caste differentiation. In a large scale genetic survey across 35 sites in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, we found that genetic caste determination associated with pairs of interbreeding lineages occurred frequently (in 26 out of the 35 sites). Overall, we identified eight lineages with genetic caste determination that always co-occurred in the same complementary lineage pairs. Three of the four lineage pairs appear to have a common origin while their relationship with the fourth remains unclear. The level of genetic differentiation among these eight lineages was significantly higher than the differentiation between P. rugosus and P. barbatus, which questions the appropriate taxonomic status of these genetic lineages. In addition to being genetically isolated from one another, all lineages with genetic caste determination were genetically distinct from P. rugosus and P. barbatus, even when colonies of interbreeding lineages co-occurred with colonies of either putative parent at the same site. Such nearly complete reproductive isolation between the lineages and the species with environmental caste determination might prevent the genetic caste determination system to be swept away by gene flow.

The Relationship Between Soil Environmental Factors and Flowering Phenology in Two Sympatric Southeastern Gelsemium Species-Does Habitat Specialization Determine Differences in Flowering Time?	CASTANEA			English	Article							REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; HYBRIDIZATION; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; PLANT; LOGANIACEAE; HYMENOPTERA; CLADISTICS; SYSTEM	Previous research has found significant differences in flowering time between sympatric, non-hybridizing populations of congeners in the genus Gelsemium (Gelsemium sempervirens and G. rankinii). An experimental approach using a common garden, reciprocal transplant experiments, and observations of natural populations were used to test the hypothesis that soil environmental variables (soil moisture and soil temperature) related to habitat specificity of the two species influence differences in flowering phenology. Replicated pairs of both species were planted into a common garden and into wet and dry habitats that typify the two species (dry for earlier flowering G. sempervirens and wet for later flowering G. rankinii). Two sites with sympatric natural populations of both species were also studied for comparison. The number of open flowers was counted every two weeks in 2007 and 2008 in all sites and in 2009 for the reciprocal transplant experiment. Soil moisture and soil temperature varied by site, date, habitat, and species but was not consistently related to flowering phenology across sites or species. Compared to natural conditions, plants in the common garden and experimental transplant populations did not show significant changes in differences in flowering times, suggesting that flowering phenology is under genetic control and is not influenced by soil environmental conditions.

Dynamics of the evolution of Batesian mimicry: molecular phylogenetic analysis of ant-mimicking Myrmarachne (Araneae : Salticidae) species and their ant models	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Batesian ant mimic; mimicry evolution; Myrmarachne phylogeny	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; ELONGATION FACTOR-1-ALPHA; SEQUENCE DIVERGENCE; SPIDERS; TREES; MYRMECOMORPHY; SUBSTITUTIONS; HYMENOPTERA; GENETICS; SYSTEMS	Batesian mimicry is seen as an example of evolution by natural selection, with predation as the main driving force. The mimic is under selective pressure to resemble its model, whereas it is disadvantageous for the model to be associated with the palatable mimic. In consequence one might expect there to be an evolutionary arms race, similar to the one involving host-parasite coevolution. In this study, the evolutionary dynamics of a Batesian mimicry system of model ants and ant-mimicking salticids is investigated by comparing the phylogenies of the two groups. Although Batesian mimics are expected to coevolve with their models, we found the phylogenetic patterns of the models and the mimics to be indicative of adaptive radiation by the mimic rather than co-speciation between the mimic and the model. This shows that there is strong selection pressure on Myrmarachne, leading to a high degree of polymorphism. There is also evidence of sympatric speciation in Myrmarachne, the reproductive isolation possibly driven by female mate choice in polymorphic species.

Genetic data indicate that long-distance gene flow between established nests is limited and new queens are primarily recruited from within their natal nest. Most matings occur between nestmates and are random at this level. In the center of the study area, budding and permanent connections between nests result in strong population viscosity, with close nests being more similar generically than distant nests. In contrast, nests located outside of this supercolony show no isolation by distance, suggesting that they have been initiated by queens that participated in mating flights rather than by budding from nearby nests in our sample population. Recruitment of nestmates as new reproductive individuals and population viscosity in the supercolony increase genetic differentiation between nests. This in turn inflates relatedness estimates among worker nestmates (r = 0.17) above what is due to close pedigree links. Local spatial genetic differentiation may favor the maintenance of altruism when workers raise queens that will disperse on foot and compete with less related queens from neighboring nests or disperse on the wing and compete with unrelated queens.

J	Linksvayer, TA				Linksvayer, Timothy A.			Ant Species Differences Determined by Epistasis between Brood and Worker Genomes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENUS LEPTOTHORAX HYMENOPTERA; APIS-MELLIFERA; INTERACTING PHENOTYPES; MULTILEVEL SELECTION; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE; EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS; SOCIAL EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; CONFLICT; ENVIRONMENT	Epistasis arising from physiological interactions between gene products often contributes to species differences, particularly those involved in reproductive isolation. In social organisms, phenotypes are influenced by the genotypes of multiple interacting individuals. In theory, social interactions can give rise to an additional type of epistasis between the genomes of social partners that can contribute to species differences. Using a full-factorial cross-fostering design with three species of closely related Temnothorax ants, I found that adult worker size was determined by an interaction between the genotypes of developing brood and care-giving workers, i.e. intergenomic epistasis. Such intergenomic social epistasis provides a strong signature of coevolution between social partners. These results demonstrate that just as physiologically interacting genes coevolve, diverge, and contribute to species differences, so do socially interacting genes. Coevolution and conflict between social partners, especially relatives such as parents and offspring, has long been recognized as having widespread evolutionary effects. This coevolutionary process may often result in coevolved socially-interacting gene complexes that contribute to species differences.

Population structure, queen mating frequency and deviation from random mating were investigated in a north-eastern Brazilian population. Eight workers from each of 33 queenright colonies and 17 queens and their progeny (20-40 offspring) were genotyped using eight variable microsatellite markers. Population differentiation tests indicated limited gene now at the scale of several kilometres, and tests of isolation by distance revealed population viscosity at the scale of a few metres. This population structure, together with the frequent colony migrations and fissions observed in the field, suggest that new nests are founded by budding in G. striatula. Genetic data showed that 13 of our 17 queens were single-mated and four were double-mated. The estimation of the range of maximal frequency of double-mated queens in the population was 0.232-0.259, demonstrating that mating frequency is low in G. striatula. The low estimated mean relatedness between the 17 queens and their mates (-0.04 +/- 0.49) indicated no evidence of inbreeding in G, striatula.

J	Kasparek, M				Kasparek, Max			Revision of the Palaearctic Trachusa interrupta species complex (Apoidea: Anthidiini) with description of four new species	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Anthidium; taxonomy; parapatry; allopatry; contact zone; speciation	BEES HYMENOPTERA APOIDEA; MEGACHILIDAE; DIVERSITY	Trachusa interrupta (Fabricius, 1781) s.l. has so far been regarded as a widespread resin bee in the tribe Anthidiini, whose range extends from northwest Africa and the Iberian Peninsula in the west to Central Asia and China in the east. It was thought that the pattern of yellow maculations on head, meso- and metasoma was quite variable. Several forms which were described since the 18th century have been regarded as synonyms. A comprehensive analysis of hundreds of specimens from all parts of its distribution found that T. interrupta s. l. actually represents a complex of closely related species. The study which included the examination of type material and the analyses of morphometric data of 15 measurements of the head, antennae and wings through multivariate statistical methods showed that there was relatively little variation in the colour pattern. Different colour patterns mostly represent different taxa which form distinctive clusters in Discriminant Function Analysis of morphometric data. The complex hereby consists of three widespread species. Trachusa interrupta (Fabricius, 1781) s.str., T. integra (Eversmann, 1852) stat. resurr. and T. anatolica sp. n., whose combined range extends from the Western Mediterranean to Central Asia and China, and five further species with restricted ranges in the southern part of the overall distribution: T. varia (Olivier, 1789) stat. resurr. and T. maghrebensis sp. n. in Spain and north-western Africa, and T. heinzi Dubitzky, 2007, T. grandicornis sp. n., and T. taurica sp. n. in Turkey and Iran. Additionally, some populations mainly of T. interrupta s. str. show in the southern part of its distribution (e.g. Spain. Italy, Greece) distinctive features in the colour pattern or morphological traits such as antennal length. As these characters are widely overlapping between populations and seem to follow geographic clines, these differences do not seem to reflect taxonomically relevant units. It was thought that they represent populations with reduced but still not ceased reproductive isolation and hence species in statu nascendi. All species of the T. interrupta complex as here defined have clearly delineated distributional areas. There is a little overlap in the distribution areas of the species and even the two most widespread species, T. interrupta s. str. and T. integra, which both occur widely in the West Palaearctic show mutually exclusive patchy distribution patterns, i.e. the two species normally do not occur in the same region. Nevertheless, a few cases were found where two species occur in sympatry, and a few cases (less than 1% of all specimens) where specimens had characters of two species. The latter may indicate that hybridisation occasionally occurs in parapatric contact zones.

This revealed genetic profiles that appeared related to host adaptation at the specific level amongst the natural populations colonizing different grasses and cereals (Poaceae) within the same geographic location. These profiles were recorded either as 'specialist' genotypes found on specific grasses, or as 'generalist' genotypes colonizing several host types including cultivated cereals or native grasses. These findings are compared with analogous systems found amongst insect species, including at a higher trophic level, i.e. interactions between hymenopterous aphid parasitoids. As the aphids and their respective plant hosts occur in the same geographical region at the same time, this appears to be a rare example of the evolutionary transition leading to sympatric speciation in insects. Hence, this study highlights the importance of understanding not only the demographic parameters to genetic diversity, but also the more intricate correlation of genetic diversity to host types in agricultural environments.

We address this issue using 462 individuals from 10 urban populations of the ant Formica japonica in Kobe City, Japan. We sampled workers regardless of colony identity, genotyped them using 6 microsatellite loci, and estimated allele frequencies and genotypes of reproductive individuals, together with other population genetic parameters, by estimating kinship structure using a likelihood method. Estimated genetic diversity and effective size of populations were not associated with environmental parameters, suggesting that populations are unaffected by urbanization. However, effective population sizes were small, and frequent population bottlenecks were detected. These results suggest that urban F. japonica populations are unstable, and the possibility of frequent extinctions and recolonizations in urban habitats. Populations were moderately differentiated without isolation by distance, suggesting a strong dispersal ability that enables colonization of urban habitats. Dispersal was male biased. Collectively, F. japonica was regarded as an urban adapter, which can colonize urban habitats by virtue of its preference for open ground and high dispersal ability but can persist in urban populations for only a short time, showing a tendency as a temporary urban inhabitant.

Taxonomists often rely on mitochondrial DNA barcoding to complement morphological species delimitations. Although COI-barcoding has largely proven successful in assisting identifications for most animal taxa, there are nevertheless numerous cases where mitochondrial barcodes do not reflect species hypotheses. For instance, what is regarded as a single species can be associated with two distinct DNA barcodes, which can point either to cryptic diversity or to within-species mitochondrial divergences without reproductive isolation. In contrast, two or more species can share barcodes, for instance due to mitochondrial introgression. These intrinsic limitations of DNA barcoding are commonly addressed with nuclear genomic markers, which are expensive, may have low repeatability and often require high-quality DNA. To overcome these limitations, we examined the use of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) as a quick and robust genomic approach to address such problematic cases of species delimitation in bees. This genomic method was assessed using six different species complexes suspected to harbour cryptic diversity, mitochondrial introgression or mitochondrial paraphyly. The sequencing of UCEs recovered between 686 and 1,860 homologous nuclear loci and provided explicit species delimitation in all investigated species complexes. These results provide strong evidence for the suitability of UCEs as a fast method for species delimitation even in recently diverged lineages. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for both mitochondrial introgression among distinct bee species, and mitochondrial paraphyly within a single bee species.

These queens produce two types of diploid offspring, those fertilized by males of the queens' lineage which develop into new queens and those fertilized by males of the other lineage which mostly develop into functionally sterile workers. This unusual mode of genetic caste determination has been found in 26 populations and a total of four lineage pairs (17,42, G(1)-G(2), H(1)-H(2) and J(1)-J(2)) have been described in these populations. Despite the fact that a few interlineage queens are produced, previous studies revealed that there is a complete lack of genetic introgression between lineages. Here we quantify the proportion of interlineage queens produced in each of the four lineage pairs and determine the fate of these queens. In the F(1)-F(2), G(1)-G(2) and H(1)-H(2) lineage pairs, interlineage queens were produced by a minority of colonies. These colonies exclusively produced interlineage queens and workers, suggesting that interlineage eggs can develop into queens in these three pairs of lineages in the absence of competition with pure-lineage brood. An analysis of three key stages of the colony life cycle revealed that colonies headed by interlineage queens failed to grow sufficiently to produce reproductive individuals. In laboratory comparisons, interlineage queens produced fewer viable eggs, with the effect that they raised fewer workers and lost more weight per worker produced than pure-lineage queens. In the J(1)-J(2), lineage pair, we did not find a single interlineage queen, raising the possibility that interlineage eggs have completely lost the ability to develop into queens in this lineage pair. Hence, two distinct mechanisms seem to account for the complete lack of between-lineage gene flow in the F(1)-F(2), G(1)-G(2). H(1)-H(2) and J(1)-J(2) lineage pairs.

However, more and more studies have revealed that the "one-to-one" rule has been broken. Co-pollinators have been reported, but we do not yet know how they evolve. They may evolve from insect speciation induced or facilitated by Wolbachia which can manipulate host reproduction and induce reproductive isolation. In addition, Wolbachia can affect host mitochondrial DNA evolution, because of the linkage between Wolbachia and associated mitochondrial haplotypes, and thus confound host phylogeny based on mtDNA. Previous research has shown that fig wasps have the highest incidence of Wolbachia infection in all insect taxa, and Wolbachia may have great influence on fig wasp biology. Therefore, we look forward to understanding the influence of Wolbachia on mitochondrial DNA evolution and speciation in fig wasps. Results: We surveyed 76 pollinator wasp specimens from nine Ficus microcarpa trees each growing at a different location in Hainan and Fujian Provinces, China. We found that all wasps were morphologically identified as Eupristina verticillata, but diverged into three clades with 4.22-5.28% mtDNA divergence and 2.29-20.72% nuclear gene divergence. We also found very strong concordance between E. verticillata clades and Wolbachia infection status, and the predicted effects of Wolbachia on both mtDNA diversity and evolution by decreasing mitochondrial haplotypes. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the pollinating wasp E. verticillata on F. microcarpa has diverged into three cryptic species, and Wolbachia may have a role in this divergence. The results also indicate that Wolbachia strains infecting E. verticillata have likely resulted in selective sweeps on host mitochondrial DNA.

Dobzhansky-Muller and Wolbachia-Induced Incompatibilities in a Diploid Genetic System	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNIDIRECTIONAL CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY; CAUSE HYBRID LETHALITY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HORIZONTAL TRANSFER; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; POPULATIONS; HYMENOPTERA; INFECTION	Genetic incompatibilities are supposed to play an important role in speciation. A general (theoretical) problem is to explain the persistence of genetic diversity after secondary contact. Previous theoretical work has pointed out that Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMI) are not stable in the face of migration unless local selection acts on the alleles involved in incompatibility. With local selection, genetic variability exists up to a critical migration rate but is lost when migration exceeds this threshold value. Here, we investigate the effect of intracellular bacteria Wolbachia on the stability of hybrid zones formed after the Dobzhansky Muller model. Wolbachia are known to cause a cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) within and between species. Incorporating intracellular bacteria Wolbachia can lead to a significant increase of critical migration rates and maintenance of divergence, primarily because Wolbachia-induced incompatibility acts to reduce frequencies of F1 hybrids. Wolbachia infect up to two-thirds of all insect species and it is therefore likely that CI co-occurs with DMI in nature. The results indicate that both isolating mechanisms strengthen each other and under some circumstances act synergistically. Thus they can drive speciation processes more forcefully than either when acting alone.

Their success undeniably comes from their various modes of reproduction and colony breeding structures, which influence their dispersal ability, reproductive potential, and foraging strategies. Almost all invasive ant species studied so far form supercolonies, a dense network of interconnected nests comprising numerous queens, without aggression toward non-nestmates. This strategy results in invasive colonies that are able to grow extremely fast and large while avoiding intraspecific competition, allowing them to monopolize environmental resources and outcompete native species. Here, we developed and used 10 microsatellite markers to investigate the population structure and breeding system of the dark rover ant Brachymyrmex patagonicus Mayr in its introduced range. We determined whether this species exhibits a supercolonial structure by assessing whether different nests belonged to the same genetic colony. We inferred its dispersal ability by investigating isolation by distance and estimated the numbers of queens per colonies and mating per queen through parent-offspring inferences. We found that most of the colonies of B. patagonicus were comprised of a single nest, headed by a single queen. Each nest was distinct from one another, without isolation by distance, which suggests strong dispersal ability through nuptial flights. These features are commonly observed in noninvasive and native ant species, but they are surprising for a successful invasive ant, as they strongly differ from other invasive ants. Overall, we discuss how this seemingly unfavorable strategy for an invasive ant might favor the invasive success of the dark rover ant in the United States.

Because ants are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis, ant-flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of antplant species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant community and local ant activity at sugar baits. As predicted, flowers of plants that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii were more strongly exploited by ants than flowers of co-occurring introduced plants, which shared an evolutionary history with ants. We also found that the percentage of plant species with ant-visited flowers was much higher in Hawaii than in other island and continental systems, even reaching 100% in habitats dominated by endemic species. We showed experimentally that the absence of ants on flowers of most introduced and few native plants species was due to morphological barriers, repellent floral scents, and to a lesser extent, unpalatable nectar. Analysis of floral volatiles, however, revealed no consistent ant-repellent "syndrome" attributable to negative responses by ants, probably due to the high chemical variability within the floral scent bouquets. Results from a molecular phylogeny imply that floral defenses against ants were convergently lost in native Hawaiian plants. Exploitation of floral nectar by ants may be an important threat to Hawaiian ecosystems, reducing nectar resources available to native flower visitors and potentially reducing the reproductive success of the endangered endemic flora.

We surveyed mtDNA sequences from 623 individuals representing 13 described and undescribed species within the species-group and 18 individuals representing other major Solenopsis lineages to generate a phylogeny of the mitochondrial genome. Our analyses support the monophyly of the S. saevissima species-group, consistent with a single Neotropical origin and radiation of this important group of ants, as well as the monophyly of the socially polymorphic species within the group, consistent with a single origin of polygyny (multiple queens per colony) as a derived form of social organization. The mtDNA sequences of the inquiline social parasite S. daguerrei form a clade that appears to be distantly related to sequences from the several host species, consistent with the view that advanced social parasitism did not evolve via sympatric speciation of intraspecific parasites. An important general finding is that species-level polyphyly of the mtDNA appears to be the rule in this group of ants. The existence of multiple divergent mtDNA lineages within several nominal species (including the pest S. invicta) suggests that the pattern of widespread polyphyly often stems from morphological delimitation that overcircumscribes species. However, in two cases the mtDNA polyphyly likely results from recent interspecific hybridization. While resolving species boundaries and relationships is important for understanding general patterns of diversification of South American fire ants, these issues are of added importance because invasive fire ants are emerging as global pests and becoming important model organisms for evolutionary research.

J	DeHeer, CJ				DeHeer, CJ			A comparison of the colony-founding potential of queens from single- and multiple-queen colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS; SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION; GENE FLOW; HYMENOPTERA; FORMICIDAE; POLYMORPHISM; STRATEGIES; EVOLUTION; SUCCESS; NUMBER	Newly mated queens from the polygyne (multiple-queen) form of S. invicta show a weight polymorphism that correlates with their genotype at the protein locus Gp-9. Although this variation in weight might be expected to translate into variation in the ability of queens to initiate new colonies using stored energy reserves, a systematic examination of the colony-founding ability of newly mated polygyne-derived queens of different weights has never been reported. Here I compare the ability of monogyne-derived queens (Gp-9(BB) M), heavy polygyne-derived queens (Gp-98(BB) P), and light polygyne-derived queens (Gp-9(Bb) P) to initiate their own colonies using only stored energy reserves. Most measurements of the ants' abilities yielded the following scale of competency: Gp-9(BB) M>Gp-9(BB) P>Gp-9(Bb) P. Surprisingly, most mated polygyne-derived queens of even the lighter genotype were capable of rearing considerable numbers of workers in isolation. This ability may be enhanced substantially in the field if such queens cooperate in initiating new nests (pleometrosis). These results are concordant with the growing body of work that implicates a simply inherited genetic polymorphism for the control of a complex social trait in this ant, and they indicate that the modes of reproduction in polygyne fire ants may show considerable diversity.

The sexually deceptive orchids Chiloglottis trapeziformis Fitzg. and Chiloglottis valida D.L. Jones are pollinated by the thynnine wasps Neozeleboria cryptoides (Smith) and Neozeleboria monticola Turner, respectively, during attempted mating with the flower labellum. The orchids and their pollinators occur mostly in allopatry; however on the overlapping edges of their ranges they can attract each other's pollinator, leading to rare hybrids. 2. Using gas chromatographic analyses with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) we demonstrate that 2-ethyl-5-propyl-1,3-cyclohexandione ('Chiloglottone'), the previously known sex pheromone of N. cryptoides and pollinator-attractant of C. trapeziformis, is also used by C. valida to attract its pollinator N. monticola. 3. In behavioural field experiments, equal numbers of males of both species responded to, and attempted copulation with, a dummy scented with synthetic Chiloglottone. In dual-choice experiments where dummies were presented at different heights, N. cryptoides males preferentially attempted copulation with dummies a few centimetres above the ground, while N. monticola males significantly more often landed on the soil and attempted copulation with dummies on the soil. 4. These behavioural differences corresponded with differences in floral height in the orchids, C. trapeziformis being about twice as tall as C. valida. We suggest that this contrasting pollinator behaviour imposes selection for floral height in the orchids.

Both species were collected as dauers from their respective hosts and cultured on bacteria on tryptic soy broth (TSB) or NGM agar. Allodiplogaster josephi n. sp. and A. seani n. sp. are morphologically closer to each other than to other species of Allodiplogaster, which was recently revised to include 37 valid species. However, the two new species are distinguished by reproductive isolation, shape of the spicule manubrium, host associations and molecular characters, the latter in sequences of the near-full length small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and partial mitochondrial COI. Morphological characterisation was supplemented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed furcation of both v5 and v6 male genital papillae, consistent with previous reports for species of the henrichae group of Allodiplogaster.

The genetic basis of interspecies host preference differences in the model parasitoid Nasonia	HEREDITY			English	Article						host preference; genetic basis; parasitic wasps; Nasonia; generalists; specialists	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION; PLANT PREFERENCE; RED QUEEN; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; LINKAGE; TRAITS; PTEROMALIDAE	The genetic basis of host preference has been investigated in only a few species. It is relevant to important questions in evolutionary biology, including sympatric speciation, generalist versus specialist adaptation, and parasite-host co-evolution. Here we show that a major locus strongly influences host preference in Nasonia. Nasonia are parasitic wasps that utilize fly pupae; Nasonia vitripennis is a generalist that parasitizes a diverse set of hosts, whereas Nasonia giraulti specializes in Protocalliphora (bird blowflies). In laboratory choice experiments using Protocalliphora and Sarcophaga (flesh flies), N. vitripennis shows a preference for Sarcophaga, whereas N. giraulti shows a preference for Protocalliphora. Through a series of inter-species crosses, we have introgressed a major locus affecting host preference from N. giraulti into N. vitripennis. The N. giraulti allele is dominant and greatly increases preference for Protocalliphora pupae in the introgression line relative to the recessive N. vitripennis allele. Through the utilization of a Nasonia genotyping microarray, we have identified the introgressed region as 16Mb of chromosome 4, although a more complete analysis is necessary to determine the exact genetic architecture of host preference in the genus. To our knowledge, this is the first introgression of the host preference of one parasitoid species into another, as well as one of the few cases of introgression of a behavioral gene between species.

We have characterized several of these microorganisms through partial sequences of the small (16S) and large (23S) subunit ribosomal DNA. All the symbionts identified, which include several cytoplasmic incompatibility microorganisms, several endosymbionts of terrestrial isopods, and symbionts of two thelytokous Trichogramma wasp species, belong to a monophyletic group of related symbionts, some of which have previously been detected in several insects exhibiting cytoplasmic incompatibility. Three molecular lineages can be identified on the basis of 16S as well as 23S sequences. Although they are only known as endocellular symbionts, Wolbachia spread by horizontal transfer across host lineages as evidenced by their diversification which occurred long after that of their hosts, and by the non-congruence of the phylogenetic relationships of symbionts and their hosts. Indeed, symbionts of two different lineages have been found in the same host species, whereas closely related endosymbionts are found in distinct insect orders. Isopod endosymbionts form a separate lineage, and they can determine feminization as well as cytoplasmic incompatibility. The ability to determine cytoplasmic incompatibility, found in all lineages, is probably ancestral to this group.

Pollinator specificity, cryptic species and geographical patterns in pollinator responses to sexually deceptive orchids in the genus Chiloglottis: the Chiloglottis gunnii complex	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							THYNNINE WASPS HYMENOPTERA; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; TIPHIIDAE; DISCRIMINATE; SPECIATION; REVISION; HEIGHTS; SYSTEM; TURNER	Australian sexually deceptive orchids are typically highly pollinator specific, each species having a single unique hymenopteran pollinator species. Pollinator specificity in six of the nine described species in the Chiloglottis gunnii Lindl. complex was investigated by using field pollinator-choice tests, with Chiloglottis taxa translocated within and among biogeographical regions. Specific pollinators revealed the existence of five undescribed cryptic taxa in the C. gunnii complex, three within C. pluricallata D. L. Jones and two within C. valida D. L. Jones, in addition to the six described species. Of the 11 Chiloglottis taxa, 10 had a single thynnine-wasp pollinator throughout their sometimes large distributions, whereas one, C. valida, had a second pollinator in parts of its distribution. Eleven pollinators belonged to the genus Neozeleboria and one to Eirone. Pollinator-choice testing showed that cross-attraction of pollinators occurs between three geographically isolated Chiloglottis taxa on the New South Wales (NSW) New England Tableland and taxa in the South Eastern Highlands of NSW and Victoria. The data suggested there is sharing of chemical attractants and supported the recognition of at least five odour types within Chiloglottis, each encompassing one to three orchid taxa and their pollinators. The following two broad generalisations are made: (1) there is no cross-attraction of pollinators among sympatric Chiloglottis species, i.e. sympatric orchid taxa do not share attractant odours; and (2) all Chiloglottis species have different specific pollinators, although they may share attractant odours allopatrically. Some 28 thynnine-wasp species were attracted as minor non-pollinating responders to Chiloglottis taxa; five of these were pollinators of other Chiloglottis species. These wasps were much more taxonomically diverse than the pollinators, belonging to six genera, and suggest that some orchid-odour components are widely shared within the sex pheromones of the Thynninae.

However, the mechanisms behind the first step of separation, the switch of individuals into new niches, are unclear. One long-standing hypothesis, which was proposed for insects but never tested, is that early learning causes new ecological preferences, leading to a switch into a new niche within one generation. Here, we show that a host switch occurred within a parasitoid wasp, which is associated with the ability for early learning and the splitting into separate lineages during speciation. Lariophagus distinguendus consists of two genetically distinct lineages, most likely representing different species. One attacks drugstore beetle larvae (Stegobium paniceum (L.)), which were probably the ancestral host of both lineages. The drugstore beetle lineage has an innate host preference that cannot be altered by experience. In contrast, the second lineage is found on Sitophilus weevils as hosts and changes its preference by early learning. We conclude that a host switch has occurred in the ancestor of the second lineage, which must have been enabled by early learning. Because early learning is widespread in insects, it might have facilitated ecological divergence and associated speciation in this hyperdiverse group.

The assessment of the diet of the stingless bee Melipona orbignyi was carried out by comparing different calculations from palynological data being the index of relative importance (IRI) the most complete, objective, and here recommended. This index showed that the order of the four most important pollen resources was Prosopis (IRI = 3354), Albizia inundata (1999), Cynophalla retusa (921), and Solanum type 2 (693), and the value of importance of species (SI) calculated for honey resources showed that they were type Maytenus (SI = 20.79), Prosopis (18.73), Cynophalla retusa (6.72), and Ziziphus mistol (3.32). Three flower types predominated in pollen and nectar provisions: brush flowers, solanoid flowers with poricidal anthers, and generalized small pale flowers, being the former two associated to buzzing. The abundance of the nectarless Solanum in honey samples is discussed. Good forest management practices for pollinator conservation native to the Chaco forest should include the keeping of undisturbed forest patches for nesting and foraging while the surrounding forest resources are managed in a sustainable way. Furthermore, because some threatened plants important for the M. orbignyi diet require gene flow to maintain healthy populations, short distances among the forest patches are needed, a fact that also helps to avoid genetic drift in Melipona colonies. The rational rearing of Melipona orbignyi would be a good practice to be implemented to promote pollination of threatened tree and shrub individuals isolated by forest fragmentation.

The combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to thiamethoxam on the performance of bumblebee micro-colonies	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Bees; Neonicotinoids; Pollination; Pollen quality; Stressors; Bee health	BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE; PROTEIN-CONTENT; POLLEN QUALITY; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; HONEY-BEES; HYMENOPTERA; CONSERVATION; DECLINE; FIELD	There is a pressing need to better understand the factors contributing to declines of wild pollinators such as bumblebees. Many different contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich habitats and nesting sites; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive pathogens; exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the nicely effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural intensification on bee declines.

However, it is predicted that variability in such cues cannot be maintained as positive, frequency-dependent selection favors the dominant cue (Crozier's paradox). We utilize a simple analytical model of 2 groups as well as computer simulations to find conditions where the coexistence (polymorphism) of 2 distinct recognition cues is maintained. We assume a species that forms reproductive groups and the adoption of a newborn individual into a group depends on that individual's genotype (recognition cue) in relation to the group's profile. We investigate the role of 2 factors affecting the level of isolation between groups, namely group tolerance toward deviant genotypes and dispersal between groups. Results from the analytical model show that high tolerance or high dispersal lead to the global fixation of a single genotype, whereas low group tolerance and low dispersal promote the globally stable coexistence of different genotypes. Interestingly, coexistence can only be global, with a different genotype dominating each group, or local, with 2 genotypes coexisting in one group, depending on the degree of tolerance and dispersal. Local coexistence, however, does not persist, when dispersal is allowed to evolve. In this case, low dispersal evolves, which stabilizes global coexistence but reduces local coexistence. If we expand the number of groups and assume spatially limited dispersal, global coexistence becomes a more likely outcome even under conditions where it was impossible in the 2-group system.

Evolutionary history of nematodes associated with sweat bees	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Cospeciation; Eusocial; Sexual transmission; Host specificity; Symbiont diversity	PHORETIC ASSOCIATE; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; BACTERIAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; COSPECIATION EVENTS; DISPARATE RATES; HYMENOPTERA; HALICTIDAE; CAENORHABDITIS; DIPLOGASTRIDAE; COEVOLUTION	Organisms that live in close association with other organisms make up a large part of the world's diversity. One driver of this diversity is the evolution of host-species specificity, which can occur via reproductive isolation following a host-switch or, given the correct circumstances, via cospeciation. In this study, we explored the diversity and evolutionary history of Acrostichus nematodes that are associated with halictid bees in North America. First, we conducted surveys of bees in Virginia, and found six halictid species that host Acrostichus. To test the hypothesis of cospeciation, we constructed phylogenetic hypotheses of Acrostichus based on three genes. We found Acrostichus purl and Acrostichus halicti to be species complexes comprising cryptic, host-specific species. Although several nodes in the host and symbiont phylogenies were congruent and tests for cospeciation were significant, the host's biogeography, the apparent patchiness of the association across the host's phylogeny, and the amount of evolution in the nematode sequence suggested a mixture of cospeciation, host switching, and extinction events instead of strict cospeciation. Cospeciation can explain the relationships between Ac. purl and its augochlorine hosts, but colonization of Halictus hosts is more likely than cospeciation. The nematodes are vertically transmitted, but sexual transmission is also likely. Both of these transmission modes may explain host-species specificity and congruent bee and nematode phylogenies. Additionally, all halictid hosts come from eusocial or socially polymorphic lineages, suggesting that sociality may be a factor in the suitability of hosts for Acrostichus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Strong structure was found at the nest level in both the monogyne (single queen) and polygyne (multiple queen) social forms using allozymes. Weak but significant microgeographic structure was detected above the nest level in polygyne populations but not in monogyne populations using both classes of nuclear markers. Pronounced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) differentiation was evident also at this level in the polygyne form only. These microgeographic patterns are expected because polygyny in ants is associated with restricted local gene flow due mainly to limited vagility of queens. Weak but significant nuclear differentiation was detected between sympatric social forms, and strong mtDNA differentiation also was found at this level. Thus, queens of each form seem unable to establish themselves in nests of the alternate type, and some degree of assortative mating by form may exist as well. Strong differentiation was found between the two study regions using all three sets of markers. Phylogeographic analyses of the mtDNA suggest that recent limitations on gene flow rather than longstanding barriers to dispersal are responsible for this large-scale structure.

Occasional colonization of archipelagos can bring together coevolving partners and cause coradiation of the colonizing species, e.g. the drepanidids and the lobelioids on Hawaii. Permanent reciprocal selective pressure between pairs of coevolving species can lead to a coevolutionary race and rapid evolutionary change. This is exemplified by spurred flowers and long-tongued flower-visitors. The geographic patterning of diffuse coevolution systems can lead to dramatic changes in species interactions. In different populations, interaction between pollinating and seed-parasitizing Greya moths and their host plants varies from mutualism to commensalism and antagonism, depending on the presence of copollinators. Asymmetrical coevolution between angiosperms and oligolectic flower-visitors may facilitate rapid reproductive isolation of populations following a food-plant switch, if the oligoleges use their specific food plants as the rendezvous sites. Diffuse coevolution between angiosperm species and pollinating insects may cause frequent convergent evolution of floral traits such as nectar reward instead of pollen reward, floral guides, zygomorphic flowers, or mimicry of pollen signals, since the multiple plant species experience similar selective pressures via the coevolving partners. Patterns of angiosperm adaptive radiation are highlighted in the context of coevolution with pollinators. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this study we present the first data on the most easterly distributed member of the genus, Cataglyphis aenescens from Mongolia. We collected workers and brood from 40 colonies from a population located on the outskirts of Sainshand, in south-eastern Mongolia, and genotyped them with microsatellite markers. In the population studied, our data strongly suggest that this species is monodomous, facultatively polygynous and exhibits a low level of polyandry compared to most other Cataglyphis species. The large worker size variation observed within colonies was not related to the level of genetic relatedness. We found no evidence of genetic isolation by distance based on workers and no evidence of thelytokous reproduction by queens as occurs in some other species. Although the sociogenetic organisation of this species could not be completely resolved, it is clear that there is a sharp contrast between C. aenescens and its closest congener, C. cursor. This underlines the variability of various life-history traits exhibited within the group, and we discuss the new findings in light of the available biological and phylogenetic information.

We combined computer simulations, population genomics, and linkage mapping using > 1000 nuclear AFLP markers and a partial mtDNA sequence to explore the genetic architecture and origin of the dependent lineages. Our samples included two pairs of hybridizing lineages, and the mitochondrial and nuclear data showed contradicting affinities between them. Clustering of individual genotypes based on nuclear markers indicated some exceptions to the general GCD system, that is, interlineage hybrid gynes as well as some pure-line workers. A genetic linkage map of P. rugosus showed one of the highest recombination rates ever measured in insects (14.0 cM/Mb), supporting the view that social insects are characterized by high recombination rates. The population data had 165 markers in which sibling pairs showed a significant genetic difference depending on the caste. The differences were scattered in the genome; 13 linkage groups had loci with F-ST > 0.9 between the hybridizing lineages J1 and J2.The mapping results and the population data indicate that the dependent lineages have been initially formed through hybridization at different points in time but the role of introgression has been insignificant in their later evolution.

Specialization in plant-pollinator relationships is a core concept in discussions of plant evolution and ecology; it is central to our thinking, not just about the ecology of plant-pollinator interactions and pollinator services, but also about reproductive isolation, speciation, extinction and assembly of communities. However, as reviewed here, the concept ` plant-pollinator specialization' has multiple definitions and uses, and these disparate uses have engendered confusion in the literature. Organizing these disparate uses into a comprehensive framework is an overdue task, prior efforts notwithstanding. 2. This contribution attempts to make clear the variation in meaning and usage of plant-pollinator specialization, including distinguishing between ecological specialization (interacting with few partners or resources), evolutionary specialization (genetic change associated with increased specialization) and phenotypic specialization (having specialized or derived phenotypic traits), with application of all three concepts to both plants and flower-visiting animals. These variations in interpretation of specialization affect how we view evolutionary and biogeographical trends, as well as extinction risk. 3. In the light of this conceptual diversity, I evaluate the relationships between specialization and possible trends in floral evolution and rates of speciation and extinction. I also address several implications of specialization for community ecology and resilience of pollination services in the face of environmental disturbance.

Consequently, metal hyperaccumulation may contribute to pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation between closely related plant species that differ in metal accumulation. Methods: To test these ideas, we characterized plant-pollinator interactions in a sympatric pair of species that differ in metal accumulation (Streptanthus polygaloides, a nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator, and S. tortuosus, a nonaccumulator). To test the elemental filter hypothesis, we presented arrays of Streptanthus polygaloides that were grown in either Ni-treated or control soils to insects at both Streptanthus polygaloides and S. tortuosus sites and recorded visitation. Key results: Naturally occurring Streptanthus polygaloides hyperaccumulated Ni in anthers and accumulated Ni in nectar, while S. tortuosus did not. Floral visitation rates in natural populations were higher to S. tortuosus than Streptanthus polygaloides. In addition, while floral visitor richness was similar, few pollinator taxa were shared between the two plant species. Nickel-treatment of Streptanthus polygaloides reduced visits by bees, but only for arrays presented at S. tortuosus sites. Conclusions: We show that the Ni hyperaccumulator S. polygaloides hosts a distinct floral visitor community, indicating that metal accumulation creates a filter for pollinators, similar to that documented for herbivores. Our study highlights a novel mechanism by which the abiotic environment can alter plant-pollinator interactions, and consequently plant reproduction and speciation.

Diversity and distribution of Wolbachia in relation to geography, host plant affiliation and life cycle of a heterogonic gall wasp	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cynipidae; Endosymbiont; Horizontal transmission; Speciation; wsp	RHAGOLETIS-CERASI DIPTERA; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY; HORIZONTAL TRANSFER; GALLWASPS HYMENOPTERA; HYBRID INTROGRESSION; STABLE COEXISTENCE; SELECTIVE SWEEPS; POPULATION; INFECTION	Background: The maternally inherited endosymbiont Wolbachia is widespread in arthropods and nematodes and can play an important role in the ecology and evolution of its host through reproductive manipulation. Here, we survey Wolbachia in Belonocnema treatae, a widely distributed North American cynipid gall forming wasp that exhibits regional host specialization on three species of oaks and alternation of sexually and asexually reproducing generations. We investigated whether patterns of Wolbachia infection and diversity in B. treatae are associated with the insect's geographic distribution, host plant association, life cycle, and mitochondrial evolutionary history. Results: Screening of 463 individuals from 23 populations including sexual and asexual generations from all three host plants across the southern U.S. showed an average infection rate of 56% with three common Wolbachia strains: wTre1-3 and an additional rare variant wTre4. Phylogenetic analysis based on wsp showed that these strains are unrelated and likely independently inherited. We found no difference in Wolbachia infection frequency among host plant associated populations or between the asexual and sexual generations, or between males and females of the sexual generation. Partially incomplete Wolbachia transmission rates might explain the occurrence of uninfected individuals. A parallel analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene in B. treatae showed high mtDNA haplotype diversity in both infected and uninfected populations suggesting an ancestral infection by Wolbachia as well as a clear split between eastern and western B. treatae mtDNA clades with a sequence divergence of > 6%. The strain wTre1 was present almost exclusively in the western clade while wTre2 and wTre3 occur almost exclusively in eastern populations. In contrast, the same strains co-occur as double-infections in Georgia and triple-infections in two populations in central Florida. Conclusions: The diversity of Wolbachia across geographically and genetically distinct populations of B. treatae and the co-occurrence of the same strains within three populations highlights the complex infection dynamics in this system. Moreover, the association of distinct Wolbachia strains with mitochondrial haplotypes of its host in populations infected by different Wolbachia strains suggests a potential role of the endosymbiont in reproductive isolation in B. treatae.

Genetic and chemical divergence among host races of a socially parasitic ant	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						chemical ecology; cuticular hydrocarbons; genetic differentiation; host race; host-parasite relationship; speciation	SLAVE-MAKING ANT; POLYERGUS-BREVICEPS; CUTICULAR HYDROCARBONS; NATURAL-SELECTION; SEX-PHEROMONE; HYMENOPTERA; SOFTWARE; ECOLOGY; QUEEN; RECOGNITION	Host-parasite associations facilitate the action of reciprocal selection and can drive rapid evolutionary change. When multiple host species are available to a single parasite, parallel specialization on different hosts may promote the action of diversifying natural selection and divergence via host race formation. Here, we examine a population of the kidnapper ant (Polyergus mexicanus) that is an obligate social parasite of three sympatric ant species: Formica accreta, F. argentea, and F. subaenescens (formerly F. fusca). Behavioral and ecological observations of P. mexicanus have shown that individual colonies parasitize only one species of host and that new Polyergus queens maintain host fidelity when establishing new colonies. To successfully adapt to a particular host, Polyergus ants may mimic or camouflage themselves with the species-specific chemical cues (cuticular hydrocarbons) that their hosts use to ascertain colony membership. To investigate the extent of host specialization, we collected both genetic and chemical data from P. mexicanus that parasitize each of the three different Formica species in sympatry. We show that host-associated genetic structure exists for both maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA data and biparentally inherited microsatellite markers. We also show that P. mexicanus can be distinguished by chemical profile according to host due to partial matching with their host. Our results support the hypothesis that host race formation is occurring among lineages of P. mexicanus that use different Formica hosts. Thus, this system may represent a promising model for illuminating the early steps of divergence, accumulation of reproductive isolation, and speciation.

This speciation process may be occurring in the case of the two phenological forms of the obligatorily myrmecophilous Phengaris arion. The main goal of our research was to study the nature and causes of difference between these forms focusing primarily on the incipient speciation via host races. Molecular analyses based on highly variable microsatellites together with Wolbachia screening, male genitalia morphometrics and host ant studies were carried out on four syntopic sample pairs. Our results show that the two phenological forms of P. arion may meet the criteria for host plant races. They coexist in sympatry in certain parts of the species range which is allowed by the adaptation to the distinct phenology of the host plants. Negative selection acts against the intermediate individuals which are on the wing in the inappropriate time frame. Thus, disruptive selection affects and produces bimodal distributions of phenotypes. However, the phenology of food plants is not entirely distinct and fluctuates year by year. Therefore, the two forms can exchange genes occasionally depending on the length of the time slot when they can meet with each other. Consequently, the reproductive isolation could not be completed and the existence of the two arion forms may represent only an incipient stage of sympatric speciation. It is also clear that Wolbachia is likely not a driver of sympatric speciation in this case.

Progress in ecological research is, however, slowed down by poor species delimitation. For example, it has not been resolved to date, how many species the European harvester ant Messor "structor" (Latreille, 1798) represents. Since its first description, splitting into additional taxa was often proposed but not accepted later on due to inconsistent support from morphology and ecology. Here, we took an iterative integrative-taxonomy approach -comparing multiple, independent data sets of the same sample - and used traditional morphometrics, Wolbachia symbionts, mitochondrial DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism, and ecological niche modelling. Using the complementarity of the data sets applied, we resolved multiple, strong disagreements over the number of species, ranging from four to ten, and the allocation of individuals to species. We consider most plausible a five-species hypothesis and conclude the taxonomic odyssey by redescribing Messor structor, M. ibericus Santschi, 1925, and M. muticus (Nylander, 1849) stat.rev., and by describing two new species, M. ponticus sp.n. and M. mcarthuri sp.n. The evolutionary explanations invoked in resolving the various data conflicts include pronounced morphological crypsis, incomplete lineage-sorting or ongoing cospeciation of endosymbionts, and peripatric speciation - these ants' significance to evolutionary biology parallels that to ecology. The successful solution of this particular problem illustrates the usefulness of the integrative approach to other systematic problems of comparable complexity and the importance of understanding evolution to drawing correct conclusions on species' attributes, including their ecology and biogeography.

Such colony odors usually have both a genetic and an environmental origin. When within-colony relatedness is high (i.e., one or very few reproductive queens), colonies comprise genetically distinct entities, and recognition based on genetic cues is reliable. However, when nests contain multiple queens and colonies comprise multiple nests (polydomy), the use of purely genetically determined recognition labels may become impractical. This is due to high within-colony genetic heterogeneity and low between-colony genetic heterogeneity. This may favor the use of environmentally determined recognition labels. However, because nests within polydomous colonies may differ in their microenvironment, the use of environmental labels may also be impractical unless they are actively mixed among the nests. Using a laboratory experiment, we found that both isolation per se and diet composition influenced the cuticular chemical profiles in workers of Formica aquilonia. In addition, the level of aggression increased when both the proportions of dietary ingredients and the availability of food were altered. This suggests that increased aggression was mediated by changes in the chemical profile and that environmental cues can mediate recognition between colonies. These results also suggest that the underlying recognition cues are mutable in response to extrinsic factors such as the amount and the composition of food.

Convergent evolution of sexual deception via chromatic and achromatic contrast rather than colour mimicry	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Colour pattern; Orchid; Pollinator; Spectral reflectance; Thynnine wasp; Visual signal	THYNNINE WASPS HYMENOPTERA; FLORAL ODOR CHEMISTRY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; POLLINATOR SPECIFICITY; ORCHIDACEAE; SCENT; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; VISION; SIGNAL	The Orchidaceae is characterised by the repeated evolution of sexual deception, one of the most specialised pollination strategies. In orchids, sexual deception involves long-range pollinator attraction via mimicry of female insect sex pheromones. At close range, visual signals involving colour mimicry, contrast to the background, and exploitation of pollinator sensory biases could attract pollinators, but remain largely untested. Here we focus on a remarkable system in which species from two only distantly related sexually deceptive orchid genera with strikingly different flowers (Drakaea livida and three species of Caladenia) share the same pollinator, males of the thynnine wasp Zaspilothynnus nigripes. We used spectral reflectance measurements and modelling to investigate pollinator perception of colour, including the first examination of overall colour patterns in flowers via colour pattern geometry analyses. Rather than closely matching the colours of female Z. nigripes, these orchids had strong chromatic and achromatic contrast against their backgrounds. For Caladenia, the sepals and petals show high contrast, while in D. livida, which has diminutive petals and sepals, it is the labellum that contrasts strongly against the background. Despite varying in colour, the Caladenia species all had strong within-flower contrast between a UV-bright central target (column and labellum) and a corolla of radiating stripes (petals and sepals). The colour pattern geometry analyses also indicated that the orchids' overall colour patterns are highly conspicuous against their backgrounds. Contrast, UV, and target patterns could all enhance detection, and exploit pollinators' innate preferences. Since colour contrast may function with a range of colours and floral forms, attracting pollinators via contrast rather than visual mimicry may be a critical but previously overlooked process facilitating the evolution of sexual deception.

Demographic and genetic responses varied over small geographic scales, and the two ecological factors interacted with the presence of the social parasite Protomognathus americanus. We conducted a 2x2 experiment in three blocks and found that the blocks, which were less than 100 m apart, reacted very differently to the treatments. Blocks differed in degree of polygyny, intranest relatedness, colony size, productivity, and sexual investment. Furthermore, these differences were associated with the presence of slave-making ants and the local availability of nest sites. Nest-site supplementation had a strong effect only in the site with the highest prevalence of social parasites, influencing there the density and investment patterns of colonies. L. longispinosus ants in the least parasitized area were strongly affected by both food- and nest-site supplementation. There, food supplementation led to a decrease in the number of queens per colony and consequently to an increase in intranest relatedness, while colonies in nest-site-supplemented areas invested fewer resources in males and produced a female-biased allocation ratio. By contrast, in a third block with a very low intracolonial relatedness, food supplementation induced an absolute and relative higher investment in males. We conclude that ecological factors influencing social organization in insect societies cannot be studied in isolation, because the interactions among factors produce far richer responses than any one variable.

However, little is known about the effective dispersal patterns of ant queens. Here we investigate the microgeographic genetic structure of mitochondrial haplotypes in polygynous populations of the ant Formica exsecta, both between pastures and among nests within pastures. An analysis of molecular variance revealed a very high genetic differentiation (Phi(ST) = 0.72) between pastures. indicating that queens rarely disperse successfully between pastures, despite the fact that pastures were sometimes as close as 1 km. Most of the pastures contained only a single haplotype, and haplotypes were frequently distinct between nearby pastures and even between groups of nests within the same pasture. In the three pastures that contained several haplotypes, haplotypes were not randomly distributed, the genetic differentiation between nests being Phi(ST) = 0.17, 0.52, and 0.69. This indicates that most queens are recruited within their parental colonies. However, a large proportion of nests contained more than one haplotype, demonstrating that colonies will sometimes accept foreign queens. The relatedness of mitochondrial genes among nestmates varied between 0.62 and 0.75 when relatedness was measured within each pasture and ranged between 0.72 and 1.0 when relatedness was assessed with all pastures as a reference population. Neighboring nests were more genetically similar than distant ones. and there was significant isolation by distance. This pattern may be due to new nests being formed by budding or by limited effective queen dispersal, probably on foot between neighboring nests. These results show that effective queen dispersal is extremely restricted even at a small geographical scale. a pattern consistent with the idea that ecological constraints are an important selective force leading to the evolution and maintenance of polygyny.

Wild queens of Bombus griseocollis, B. nevadensis and B. vosnesenskii were collected and maintained for establishment of nests. Queens that died during rearing or that did not lay eggs within one month of capture were dissected, and tissues were examined microscopically for the presence of pathogens. Filamentous fungi that were detected were plated on artificial media containing broad spectrum antibiotics for isolation and identification. Based on morphological characters, the fungus was identified as Ascosphaera apis (Maasen ex Claussen) Olive and Spiltoir, a species that has been reported earlier only from larvae of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, the Asian honey bee, Apis cerana, and the carpenter bee Xylocopa californica arizonensis. The identity of the fungus was confirmed using molecular markers and phylogenetic analysis. Ascosphaera apis was detected in queens of all three bumble bee species examined. Of 150 queens dissected, 12 (8%) contained vegetative and reproductive stages of the fungus. Both fungal stages were also detected in two workers collected from colonies with Ascosphaera-infected B. nevadensis queens. In this study, wild bees could have been infected prior to capture for rearing, or, the A. apis infection could have originated via contaminated European honey bee pollen fed to the bumble bees in captivity. Thus, the discovery of A. apis in adult bumble bees in the current study has important implications for commercial production of bumble bee colonies and highlights potential risks to native bees via pathogen spillover from infected bees and infected pollen.

J	Tanner, CJ; Keller, L				Tanner, Colby J.; Keller, Laurent			Nest distribution varies with dispersal method and familiarity-mediated aggression for two sympatric ants	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						familiarity-mediated aggression; fission dispersal; Plectroctena mandibularis; spatial distribution; Streblognathus peetersi	AETHIOPICUS SMITH HYMENOPTERA; COLONIZATION TRADE-OFF; INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; SITE SELECTION; COLONY FUSION; PONERINE ANT; REPRODUCTION; RECOGNITION	Dispersal mechanisms and competition together play a key role in the spatial distribution of a population. Species that disperse via fission are likely to experience high levels of localized competitive pressure from conspecifics relative to species that disperse in other ways. Although fission dispersal occurs in many species, its ecological and behavioural effects remain unclear. We compared foraging effort, nest spatial distribution and aggression of two sympatric ant species that differ in reproductive dispersal: Streblognathus peetersi, which disperse by group fission, and Plectroctena mandibularis, which disperse by solitary wingless queens. We found that although both species share space and have similar foraging strategies, they differ in nest distribution and aggressive behaviour. The spatial distribution of S. peetersi nests was extremely aggregated, and workers were less aggressive towards conspecifics from nearby nests than towards distant conspecifics and all heterospecific workers. By contrast, the spatial distribution of P. mandibularis nests was overdispersed, and workers were equally aggressive towards conspecific and heterospecific competitors regardless of nest distance. Finally, laboratory experiments showed that familiarity led to the positive relationship between aggression and nest distance in S. peetersi. While unfamiliar individuals were initially aggressive, the level of aggression decreased within 1 h of contact, and continued to decrease over 24 h. Furthermore, individuals from near nests that were not aggressive could be induced to aggression after prolonged isolation. Overall, these results suggest that low aggression mediated by familiarity could provide benefits for a species with fission reproduction and an aggregated spatial distribution.

Biology and adaptive radiation in the gall-inducing Cecidomyiidae (Insecta Diptera) and Calophyidae (Insecta Hemiptera) on Mangifera indica (Anacardiaceae) in the Indian subcontinent	TROPICAL ZOOLOGY			English	Review						adaptive radiation; biogeography; Calophyidae; Cecidomyiidae; gall-inducing taxa; host shifts; Indian subcontinent; Mangifera indica	PROCONTARINIA-MATTEIANA KIEFFER; SAWFLIES HYMENOPTERA; WASPS HYMENOPTERA; ANDRICUS-KOLLARI; MANGO CULTIVARS; HOST RACES; EVOLUTION; DIVERSITY; MORPHOLOGY; PSYLLOIDEA	Out of the nearly 250 species of plant-feeding arthropods that utilize Mangifera indica, about 25 gall midge species (Diptera Cecidomyiidae) (mostly species of Procontarinia Kieffer & Cecconi 1906) and one psylloid species (Apsylla cistellata (Buckton 1893), Hemiptera Calophyidae) are the known gall-inducing taxa. Almost all of these gall midges induce galls on leaves, whereas the psylloid induces galls on axillary vegetative buds. The M. indica-associated species of Procontarinia do not show any striking level of shifts either between organs within M. indica or between other Indian anacardiaceous taxa such as Anacardium, Buchanania, Lannea, Holigarna, Pistacia, and Semecarpus, which, in fact, host several other species of Cecidomyiidae and Calophyidae. Given that galls induced by a suspected gall-midge species on the fossil leaves of an ancestral taxon of Mangifera indica from the Upper Palaeocene sediments of north-eastern India exist, the lack of radiation from leaves either to other organs of M. indica or to other anacardiaceous extant taxa suggests that neither the feeding behaviour nor the larval salivary physiology of species of Procontarinia has changed over time. The reason for such a conservative behaviour could be either the lack of resistance-breaking genes in the M. indica-associated Procontarinia complex or the abundance of populations of M. indica. A provisional reconstruction of the relationships among the extant M. indica-infesting gall-inducing Cecidomyiidae reveals that an extremely modest level of radiation in the leaf-gall-inducing species has occurred from those species that induce structurally simple galls to those that induce structurally complex galls. Because M. indica is an evergreen, polyaxial species, with new leaf flushes available almost throughout the year, and thus offering a continuous nutritional supply, the radiation and diversification of gall midges could have been restricted. In addition, the diverse, geographically localized varieties of M. indica with different types of secondary chemicals (e.g., xanthones and flavanols) may have also imposed a selection pressure on the radiation of gall midges; for instance, mangiferin, the principal secondary chemical present in M. indica, possibly acts as an attractant to the Cecidomyiidae and Apsylla cistellata and has, consequently, restricted their diversification. We speculate that the gall midges may have progressed conservatively specializing along the host-plant lines, because of the need for precise timing and for minimizing competitive interactions with other parasitic, predatory, and inquilinous arthropods, from the time of original host colonization. Available data on the gall-inducing species of the Procontarinia complex on the leaves of M. indica indicates that both the location and structure of galls generally agree with the patterns evident in other groups of gall-inducing insects, which induce galls of similar morphology, suggesting pathways of Procontarinia phylogeny. Galls of different morphologies occur concurrently, mostly on the leaves of M. indica, and such an occurrence needs to be explored to establish the origin of multiple species of Procontarinia. In the context of M. indica-associated gall midges, only Procontarinia mangiferae lives both on stems and leaves of M. indica, indicating a critical step in Procontarinia speciation, through reproductive isolation involving phenological separation. Different species of Procontarinia occur on the same host tree and on the same leaf, but how different populations of gall-midge taxa partitio their resources effectively and reduce inter-specific competition remain as questions. Effective utilization of the host plant and consequent speciation in the Procontarinia complex have resulted from the condition that continuously blossoming individual trees of M. indica are available throughout extensive landscapes. But apart from these speculative propositions, a need for empirical studies on the phylogeny and interactions between Procontarinia (and related genera) and M. indica exists. In Calophyidae, Apsylla Crawford 1912 did not speciate on M. indica; this may also be true for the three species of Calophya Lbw 1879 associated with M. indica. Due to insufficient information this proposition remains unverified.

Nuclear-mitochondrial discordance and gene flow in a recent radiation of toads	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Toads; Hybridization; Gene flow; Speciation; AFLPs; Nuclear-mitochondrial discordance	NORTH-AMERICAN SALAMANDERS; POLYMORPHISM AFLP MARKERS; BUFO-AMERICANUS; SEXUAL SELECTION; EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS; PHYSALAEMUS-PUSTULOSUS; NEODIPRION HYMENOPTERA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; ALLOZYME VARIATION	Natural hybridization among recently diverged species has traditionally been viewed as a homogenizing force, but recent research has revealed a possible role for interspecific gene flow in facilitating species radiations. Natural hybridization can actually contribute to radiations by introducing novel genes or reshuffling existing genetic variation among diverging species. Species that have been affected by natural hybridization often demonstrate patterns of discordance between phylogenies generated using nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA in order to examine patterns of gene flow and nuclear-mitochondrial discordance in the Anaxyrus americanus group, a recent radiation of North American toads. We found high levels of gene flow between putative species, particularly in species pairs sharing similar male advertisement calls that occur in close geographic proximity, suggesting that prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms and isolation by distance are the primary determinants of gene flow and genetic differentiation among these species. Additionally, phylogenies generated using AFLP and mitochondrial data were markedly discordant, likely due to recent and/or ongoing natural hybridization events between sympatric populations. Our results indicate that the putative species in the A. americanus group have experienced high levels of gene flow, and suggest that their North American radiation could have been facilitated by the introduction of beneficial genetic variation from admixture between divergent populations coming into secondary contact after glacial retreats.

Intraspecific, facultative social parasites use the nest and worker force of another colony of the same species to rear their own young as a reproductive strategy alternative to independent nest foundation. Intraspecific parasites face barriers similar to those of interspecific social parasites: they must bypass host nestmate recognition abilities and keep host workers under control. In the present study, we investigate the cuticular chemical signature of Polistes biglumis paper wasps when they behave as intraspecific social parasites and invade conspecific colonies. We performed our analysis on three geographically separated populations, which differ in their social structure; in one population foundresses regularly produce workers, whereas in the others they rarely do. We tested whether the chemical signature of females which parasitize conspecific colonies resembles that of females who found their colonies, and if this effect is similar among populations with high and low numbers of workers. Our results show that in the two populations where foundresses produce virtually no workers, the hydrocarbon signatures of intraspecific social parasites were not chemically distinct from those of the foundresses. In contrast, in the population where foundresses usually produce workers, the hydrocarbon signatures of intraspecific social parasites had a significantly larger proportion of long-chained and branched hydrocarbons than those of foundresses. These characteristics may have evolved in that population to facilitate parasite exploitation of the host workforce, as long-chained and branched hydrocarbons are relevant as recognition and fertility cues. The lack of workers in the other populations may have relaxed the selection pressure that host workers impose on the chemical signature of intraspecific social parasites.	[Lorenzi, M.

Natural enemies (e.g., predators, parasites, and herbivores) are ubiquitous in food webs and are predicted to have significant impacts on phenotypic diversity and on speciation, and extinction rates of their prey. Spurred by the development of a theoretical framework beginning in the late 1970s, there is now a growing body of literature that addresses the effects of enemy-prey interactions on the evolution of prey. A number of theoretical models predict that enemies can produce phenotypic divergence between closely related species, even in the absence of interspecific competition for resources. Effects on diversification of prey are more variable, and enemies may either enhance or depress speciation and extinction rates of their prey. Empirical evidences from a number of study systems, notably those involving predators and prey in aquatic environments and interactions between insects and flowering plants, confirm both predictions. There is now considerable evidence for the role of enemies, especially those that are size-selective or use visual cues when identifying suitable prey, on phenotypic divergence of sympatric and allopatric taxa. Enemies may spur diversification rates in certain groups under some circumstances, and hinder diversification rates in other cases. I suggest that further research should focus on the role of enemies in diversification of prey, with significant insights likely to be the product of applying traditional experimental approaches and emerging comparative phylogenetic methods.

We report here the presence of Wolbachia in native South American populations of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, but the apparent absence of the bacteria in introduced populations of this pest species in the USA. The Wolbachia strains in native S. invicta are of two divergent types (A and B), and the frequency of infection varies dramatically between geographical regions and social forms of this host. Survey data reveal that Wolbachia also are found in other native fire ant species within the Solenopsis saevissima species complex from South America, including S. richteri. This latter species also has been introduced in the USA, where it lacks Wolbachia, Sequence data reveal complete phylogenetic concordance between mtDNA haplotype in S. invicta and Wolbachia infection type (A or B). In addition, the mtDNA and associated group A Wolbachia strain in S. invicta are more closely related to the mtDNA and Wolbachia strain found in S. richteri than they are to the mtDNA and associated group B Wolbachia in S. invicta. These data are consistent with historical introgression of S. richteri cytoplasmic elements into S, invicta populations, resulting in enhanced infection and mtDNA polymorphisms in S. invicta. Wolbachia may have significant fitness effects on these hosts (either directly or by cytoplasmic incompatibility) and therefore these microbes potentially could be used in biological control programmes to suppress introduced fire ant populations.

The bumble bee Bombus bifarius comprises two geographically disparate color groups characterized by red-banded and black-banded abdominal pigmentation, but with a range of spatially and phenotypically intermediate populations across western North America. Microsatellite analyses have revealed that B.bifarius in the USA are structured into two major groups concordant with geography and color pattern, but also suggest ongoing gene flow among regional populations. In this study, we better resolve the relationships among major color groups to better understand evolutionary mechanisms promoting and maintaining such polymorphism. We analyze >90,000 and >25,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms derived from transcriptome (RNAseq) and double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), respectively, in representative samples from spatial and color pattern extremes in B.bifarius as well as phenotypic and geographic intermediates. Both ddRAD and RNAseq data illustrate substantial genome-wide differentiation of the red-banded (eastern) color form from both black-banded (western) and intermediate (central) phenotypes and negligible differentiation among the latter populations, with no obvious admixture among bees from the two major lineages. Results thus indicate much stronger background differentiation among B.bifarius lineages than expected, highlighting potential challenges for revealing loci underlying color polymorphism from population genetic data alone. These findings will have significance for resolving taxonomic confusion in this species and in future efforts to investigate color-pattern evolution in B.bifarius and other polymorphic bumble bee species.

A previous study theoretically showed that small populations have elevated risks of extinction due to the positive feedback between inbreeding and small population size, referred to as the diploid male vortex. A few modeling studies have suggested that the diploid male vortex may not be as common because balancing selection at sex determining loci tends to maintain high allelic diversity in spatially structured populations. However, the generality of the conclusion is yet uncertain, as they were drawn either from models developed for particular systems or from a general-purpose competition model. To attest the conclusion, we study several well-studied host-parasitoid models that incorporate functional response specifying the number of attacked hosts given a host density and derive the conditions for a diploid male vortex in a single population. Then, we develop spatially structured individual-based versions of the models to include female behavior, diploid male fertility, and temporal fluctuations. The results show that producing a handful of successful offspring per female parasitoid could enable parasitoid persistence when a typical number of CSD alleles are present. The effect of functional response depends on the levels of fluctuations in host abundance, and inviable or partially fertile diploid males and a small increase in dispersal can alleviate the risk of a diploid male vortex. Our work supports the generality of effective genetic rescue in spatially connected parasitoid populations with sl-CSD. However, under more variable climate, the efficacy of the CSD mechanism may substantially decline.

We tested HAD on populations of Aphidius ervi the main parasitoid of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, emerging from host populations specialized on either alfalfa or red clover. Host and parasitoid populations were assessed for genetic variation and structure, while considering geography, host plant and host aphid protective symbionts Regiella insecticola and Hamiltonella defensa as potential covariables. Cluster and hierarchical analyses were used to assess the contribution of these variables to population structure, based on genotyping pea aphids and associated A. ervi with microsatellites, and host aphid facultative symbionts with 16S rDNA markers. Pea aphid genotypes were clearly distributed in two groups closely corresponding with their plant origins, confirming strong plant associated differentiation of this aphid in North America. Overall parasitism by A. ervi averaged 21.5 % across samples, and many parasitized aphids producing a wasp hosted defensive bacteria, indicating partial or ineffective protective efficacy of these symbionts in the field. The A. ervi population genetic data failed to support differentiation according to the host plant association of their pea aphid host. Potential for parasitoid specialization was also explored in experiments where wasps from alfalfa and clover aphids were reciprocally transplanted on alternate hosts, the hypothesis being that wasp behaviour and parasitic stages should be most adapted to their host of origin. Results revealed higher probability of oviposition on the alfalfa aphids, but higher adult emergence success on red clover aphids, with no interaction as expected under HAD. We conclude that our study provides no support for the HAD in this system. We discuss factors that might impair A. ervi specialization on its divergent aphid hosts on alfalfa and clover.

Ants are among the species that form "anonymous societies": members are not required to tell each other apart as individuals for the group to remain unified. Rather, each society depends on shared cues recognized by all its members. These cues permit societies to reach populations in the low millions in certain ant and termite species, and to grow indefinitely populous, expansive, and possibly long lasting in a few other ant species, which are described as having supercolonies. Anonymous societies are contrasted with "individual recognition societies" such as those of most vertebrates, which are limited to a few individuals by the necessity that the members individually recognize each other. The shared recognition cues of ants provide clear criteria for defining colonies and are what enables a supercolony to remain a single society no matter how large it becomes. I examine the often conflicting ideas about the best studied ant with supercolonies, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Its invasive supercolonies, containing in some cases billions of workers and queens spread over hundreds of square kilometers, can be most parsimoniously understood as single colonies that have had an opportunity to expand across regions of suitable habitat because of a lack of well-matched competitors. This capacity for unrestricted growth is the defining characteristic of supercolonies. There is no evidence that the local patchiness of nests and patterns of worker and food traffic within these wide-ranging populations are so invariant that supercolonies do not exist but instead are collections of numerous independent nest clusters that should be called "colonies." Nor is there evidence for the hypothesis that invasive supercolonies have been able to grow large and successful overseas only as a result of evolving through genetic drift or selection to become fundamentally different from the smaller colonies typical of the species' region of origin around northern Argentina. The most unique feature of the Argentine ant, however, is not that its colonies are anonymous or that they can grow indefinitely large-though the last trait is found only in a few ant species and humans. Rather, it is that Argentine ant colonies do not interbreed. Indeed, the only fighting among Argentine ants occurs along colony borders, which even reproductives seldom, if ever, cross and survive. For this reason, each Argentine ant supercolony acts as virtually a sibling species.

As a result, four genetically and ecologically distinct R. pomonella populations that display partial reproductive isolation have evolved. Host shifting by Rhagoletis and similar evolutionary histories could have had cascading effects across trophic levels, influencing the diversity and distribution of associated parasitoid guilds. To establish the basis for a future understanding of the possible effect of divergence in R. pomonella populations on the parasitoids attacking these flies, we surveyed parasitoids from five different species of hawthorns distributed over 15 states in Mexico and 2 states in the midwestern United States. Emerging parasitoids were identified, parasitism rates were calculated, and regional fly and parasitoid emergence schedules were determined. Parasitism rate, emergence schedules, Shannon-Weiner diversity indexes, and species accumulation curves were compared across three main geographical regions. Parasitism levels varied greatly among regions from an overall high of 27.2% in the United States to 5.5% in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) mountains of Mexico, to as low as 0.19% in the Eje Volcanico Trans Mexicano (EVTM). Shannon-Weiner diversity indexes showed that parasitoid species diversity was similar across the distribution range of R. pomonella in Mexico and the United States because of the fact that total parasitism was dominated by only two species, one of them recovered across the whole North American range of hawthorn infesting Rhagoletis. Nevertheless, eight parasitoids were found attacking R. pomonella in Mexico compared with only four collected in the United States. Only two diapausing parasitoid species were shared between the U.S. and Mexican R. pomonella populations: Utetes canaliculatus and Diachasmimorpha mellea. Interestingly, many subtropical parasitoid species, usually associated to flies in the subtropical genus Anastrepha, were recovered in the SMO in low numbers. The wide distribution of U. canaliculatus and D. mellea offers an ideal opportunity to test for a shared biogeography and co-evolution between fly and parasitoids. In this regard, one factor contributing to the success of U canaliculatus seems to be the wasp's ability to modulate its eclosion time to track regional variation in hawthorn fruiting phenology and host (i.e., fly larvae) availability. Both R. pomonella and U. canaliculatus from southern sites emerged later than insects from northern populations, mirroring seasonal differences in hawthorn fruiting times across Mexico and the United States. These results suggest that molecular studies and crossing experiments could show, as they have for Rhagoletis, recent speciation events for parasitoid species of Nearctic origin that were found to be ecologically tracking environmentally driven divergence of their tephritid hosts.
