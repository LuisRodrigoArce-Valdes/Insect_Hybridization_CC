**LIFE-HISTORY PATTERNS OF NEARCTIC MOUNTAIN MIDGES (DIPTERA, DEUTEROPHLEBIIDAE)**

COURTNEY, GW. 1991

Mountain midges (Diptera: Deuterophlebiidae) are widespread and seasonally abundant in streams of western North America. As part of a comprehensive systematic investigation of the Deuterophlebiidae, I examined the life histories of all Nearctic species, including aspects of habitat, reproductive biology, and phenology. Collection techniques were also evaluated. This paper is based on qualitative data obtained during a seven-year period (1981-1988) and from more than 500 collection sites, and on a quantitative phenological study in 1986 of 17 populations from the Pacific Northwest. Deuterophlebiids generally are considered stenobionts, requiring cold, mountain streams; however, many species inhabit a diversity of stream types, from small, high-gradient creeks to large, low-gradient rivers. The immature stages of all species are restricted to riffle habitats where current velocities typically exceed 1 m/s. Adult mountain midges exhibit marked diel synchrony, with emergence, flight, and mating during only the early morning. Flight behaviour of the short-lived adults is distinct and includes formation of male swarms. Field and laboratory observations show that females shed their wings and select oviposition sites underwater. Asynchronous life histories are typical of Nearctic species, with egg-hatching and adult emergence usually extending 2-3 mo. This strategy is adaptive for populations in the Pacific Northwest, where unpredictable spring spates may scour substrates and cause correspondingly high mortality of stream benthos. Univoltine life histories are typical of Nearctic mountain midges, though variation from this pattern was seen in three populations. Temporal, habitat and/or reproductive isolation of sympatric deuterophlebiids, blepharicerids, and other torrenticolous insects was evident in many streams.

**Divergence and evolution of reproductive barriers among three allopatric populations of Rhagoletis cingulata across eastern North America and Mexico**

Tadeo, E; Feder, JL; Egan, SP; Schuler, H; Aluja, M; Rull, J. 2015

Geography is often a key factor facilitating population divergence and speciation. In this regard, the geographic distributions of flies in the genus Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) in temperate North America have been affected by cycles of Pleistocene glaciation and interglacial periods. Fluctuations in climatic conditions may have had their most dramatic effects on geographically isolating Rhagoletis flies in the central highland region of Mexico. During past periods of allopatry, a degree of post-zygotic reproductive isolation appears to have evolved between hawthorn-infesting populations of Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) in the central Eje Volcanico Trans Mexicano (EVTM) and those from the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains (SMO) of Mexico, as well as hawthorn flies from the eastern USA. Here, we investigate the generality of this finding in the genus Rhagoletis by testing for reproductive isolation among populations of Rhagoletis cingulata (Loew) (Diptera: Tephritidae) collected from infested domesticated sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) in the USA and black cherry [Prunus serotina Ehrh. (both Rosaceae)] from the SMO and EVTM. We report evidence for marked post-mating reproductive isolation among certain R.cingulata populations. The high levels of reproductive isolation were observed between R.cingulata flies from populations in the USA and SMO differed from the pattern seen for R.pomonella, primarily involving the EVTM. In addition, egg hatch was significantly reduced for crosses between SMO males and EVTM females, but not greatly in the opposite direction. We discuss potential causes for the different patterns of post-mating reproductive isolation among Rhagoletis flies.

**Persistence and Retention of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus in Stable Flies (Diptera: Muscidae)**

Rochon, K; Baker, RB; Almond, GW; Gimeno, IM; De Leon, AAP; Watson, DW. 2015

We investigated the acquisition of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus by the stable fly (Diptera: Muscidae; Stomoxys calcitrans (L.)) through a bloodmeal, and virus persistence in the digestive organs of the fly using virus isolation and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Stable flies were fed blood containing live virus, modified live vaccine virus, chemically inactivated virus, or no virus. Stable flies acquired PRRSV from the bloodmeal and the amount of virus in the flies declined with time, indicating virus did not replicate in fly digestive tissues. Virus RNA was recovered from the flies fed live virus up to 24 h postfeeding using virus isolation techniques and 96 h using qRT-PCR. We further examined the fate of PRRSV in the hemolymph of the flies following intrathoracic injection to bypass the midgut barrier. PRRSV was detected in intrathoracically inoculated adult stable flies for 10 d using qRT-PCR. In contrast to what we observed in the digestive tract, detectable virus quantities in the intrathoracically inoculated stable flies followed an exponential decay curve. The amount of virus decreased fourfold in the first 3 d and remained stable thereafter, up to 10 d.

**Sex chromosomes in mitotic and polytene tissues of Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera, Tephritidae) from Argentina: a review**

Giardini, MC; Milla, FH; Lanzavecchia, S; Nieves, M; Cladera, JL. 2015

Cytogenetics, which is considered a fundamental tool to understand basic genetic and genomic issues of species, has greatly contributed to the description of polymorphisms both at inter- and intra-specific level. In fact, cytogenetics was one of the first approaches used to propose Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) as a complex of cryptic species. Different morphological variants of sex chromosomes have been reported among Argentinean populations of A. fraterculus. However, since this high structural variability in sex chromosomes does not pose a reproductive barrier, their role in speciation is yet to be unveiled. This review provides an update on general aspects of cytogenetics in Argentinean A. fraterculus populations, focused on the prevalence of X-Y arrangements.

**Evolution of intrinsic reproductive isolation among four North American populations of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae)**

Rull, J; Aluja, M; Feder, JL. 2010

Across its range in North America, four geographically separated, ecologically and genetically diverged populations of hawthorn (Crataegus)-infesting Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) flies inhabit the Eje Volcanico Trans Mexicano (EVTM), the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO), the Chiapas Highlands (CHIS) and the USA. Here, we tested whether these four populations are reproductively isolated by any intrinsic, nonhost-related, pre- or postmating barriers to gene flow. Crossing experiments suggested that a low level of host-independent prezygotic isolation may exist between hawthorn flies from EVTM and the three other populations, but only with respect to a slight reduction in copulation duration in EVTM matings. Some evidence for postmating isolation was found, again primarily involving EVTM crossed to SMO, CHIS and US flies. Certain crosses produced no (SMO male x EVTM female) or few (EVTM male x CHIS female; CHIS male x SMO female) F1 **hybrid** offspring. F2 crosses were generally fertile, except for US male x CHIS female matings. Inherent reproductive isolation therefore appears to be quantitative rather than absolute between populations, as the possibility for gene flow exists through at least some combinations of mating among EVTM, SMO, CHIS and US flies. Our results are consistent with a recently advanced hypothesis that episodic introgression from Mexico into the USA has played a role in providing genetic variation, facilitating sympatric host race formation and the adaptive radiation of the R. pomonella sibling species' complex in the USA.

**Reproductive isolation among geographical populations of Drosophila bipectinata duda (Diptera, Drosophilidae) with recognition of three subspecies**

Matsuda, M; Tomimura, Y; Tobari, YN. 2005

Among D. bipectinata Duda, 1923, three subspecies, bipectinata from Southeast Asia (SEA) and Okinawa (OKN), szentivanii stat. nov. from Papua New Guinea (PNG) (Mather & Dobzhansky, 1962) and pacificiae ssp. nov. from South Pacific Ocean (SPO), are recognized. The external morphology of the reproductive organs and the numbers of teeth per row in the sex combs are different between the three subspecies. Furthermore, the sterility of **hybrid** males between strains from the different regions confirms the subspecies status of each population from SEA, PNG and SPO, together with different gene arrangements in the geographical populations. Although males of the strains from OKN (Okinawa), the northernmost population, show significant differences in the number of teeth of sex combs from males of SEA (Southeast Asia) strains, **hybrid** males between them are fertile.

**Evolution of insect pheromones and their role in reproductive isolation and speciation**

Wicker-Thomas, C. 2011

The importance for reproductive isolation of a change in the pheromone biosynthetic pathway, resulting in a different pheromone blend, is discussed in Lepidoptera and Diptera. The different sites of pheromone production and the biosynthetic enzymes are briefly reviewed. Two examples of a modification in the pheromone blend leading to reproductive isolation in Lepidoptera are taken as examples: the first, in Ostrinia nubilalis, is involved in the formation of two different populations showing reproductive isolation; the second, in the genus Ostrinia, might be at the origin of the formation of two different species. In both examples, a modification in the function of a desaturase involved in pheromone biosynthesis brings about change in the pheromone blend. In the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, a mutation at a desaturase locus leads to the formation of two populations which differ in their pheromone mixtures and have developed premating isolation. The closely related species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, differ in their female pheromonal cuticular hydrocarbons. This pherornonal difference is due to two species- and female-specific genes, desatF and eloF. The activity of desatF could account for an effective barrier between these species. All these examples show that a birth and death process of desaturases is at the origin of major shifts in the pheromone blend leading to sexual isolation and speciation.

**PHEROMONE ANALYSES OF THE ANASTREPHA FRATERCULUS (DIPTERA: TEPHRITIDAE) CRYPTIC SPECIES COMPLEX**

Brirzova, R; Mendonca, AL; Vanickova, L; Mendonca, AL; Da Silva, CE; Tomcala, A; Paranhos, BAJ; Dias, VS; Joachim-Bravo, IS; Hoskovec, M; Kalinova, B; Do Nascimento, RR. 2013

The South American fruit fly Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) cryptic species complex is presently one of the most studied pest models in terms of speciation and population mating compatibility. The improvement of pest-control techniques has strongly relied on successful implementation of laboratory strains into wild populations. Pheromone communication plays an important role in the mating process in the South American fruit fly. Therefore, the main goal of the present study was to investigate the pheromone composition of 7 different populations, originating from geographically distant locations in Brazil and Argentina. Fourteen volatile compounds were identified in calling male emanations by GCxGC/TOF-MS and the data obtained were subsequently analyzed by multivariate statistics. The pheromone composition varied both quantitatively and qualitatively among the studied populations. These results will serve as the basis for further electrophysiological analyses.

**SPECIES-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SPERMATOGENESIS IN DROSOPHILA-MOJAVENSIS (PATTERSON) (DIPTERA, DROSOPHILIDAE)**

PANTAZIDIS, AC; ZOUROS, E; GALANOPOULOS, VK. 1992

Spermatogenesis in Drosophila mojavensis (Diptera : Drosophilidae) begins with the proliferation of a primary gonial cell, leading to the formation of a cyst with 16 primary spermatocytes that subsequently enter a growth phase towards the end of meiosis. As their development proceeds, primary spermatocytes assume a characteristic species-specific appearance regarding the morphology of their nucleus. Meiosis produces a syncytium of 64 spermatids, each one of which bears one nucleus and one compact mass (nebenkern), composed of mitochondria. During spermiogenesis, the newly formed spermatids undergo a structural transformation that leads to the formation of the mature sperm: the spherical nucleus is reduced to a 0.1 x 75 mum cylinder and the nebenkern separates into 2 mitochondrial derivatives, which elongate to 2400 mum, while associated with the axoneme. Both mitochondrial derivatives of the mature sperm, although disparate in size, are relatively large and have paracrystalline bodies that occupy a great part of their mass.

**Mitochondrial phylogeography of the vegetable pest Liriomyza trifolii (Diptera : Agromyzidae): Diverged clades and invasive populations**

Scheffer, SJ; Lewis, ML. 2006

The leafmining fly Liriornyza trifohi (Burgess) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is an important pest of vegetable and cut-flower crops. In recent decades, this species has become invasive, spreading from the Americas to the rest of the world. Despite substantial losses caused by Lirioinyza leafminers, the systematics of these flies has remained poorly understood because of their small size and morphological homogeneity. Previous molecular research on other polyphagous Liriomyza pests has suggested that cry tic species may be present. Here, we use mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequence variation to investigate phylogeographic structure within L. trifolii. Our results indicate that L. trifohi harbors distinct phylogenetic clades, suggesting the presence of cryptic species. There is also evidence of a recently derived, highly specialized pepper (Capsicunt spp., Solanaceae)-feeding population within L. trifolii that may represent a host race or even a distinct species. Introduced populations from various locations contained a highly restricted subset of the mitochondrial variation present within L. trifolii, suggesting one or more bottlenecks during colonization.

**Hybridization in Phlebotominae (Diptera: Psychodidae): A mini-review**

dos Reis, YV; Alevi, KCC. 2020

Taxonomy based only on morphology, although extremely important for the classification of sandflies, has been shown to be insufficient for the delimitation of some taxa. Thus, integrative taxonomy could play a fundamental role in clarifying these and other taxonomic issues, since data from different areas are used to aggregate greater reliability in species classification. Experimental crosses are important taxonomic tools, since the presence of reproductive barriers when associated with divergence between two evolutionary lineages, confirms the specific status of taxa based on the biological species concept. In the subfamily Phlebotominae, experimental crosses were mostly focused on the study of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex, which helped to identify different evolutionary lineages for that group of vectors. Considering the difficulty of classifying some Phlebotominae species and the importance of **hybrid**ization studies for taxonomy, we grouped all the information associated with experimental crosses in sandflies in a mini-review. In view of the results grouped in this review, it is evident that i) experimental crossings are important tools to aggregate studies of integrative taxonomy in the Phlebotominae subfamily; ii) these analyses should be applied in the taxonomic studies of cryptic species; iii) Lu longipalpis populations have pre and/or post-zygotic reproductive barriers; iv) Lu. longipalpis represents more than one species and efforts must be applied to differentiate the taxa of the Lu. longipalpis complex; v) Phlebotomus populations do not present intraspecific reproductive barriers; vi) the absence of reproductive barriers between Ph. sergenti from Israel and Turkey (representing populations of the same evolutionary lineage) does not rule out the possible existence of cryptic species, it being necessary to perform experimental crosses between the different strains indicated by the molecular markers; and finally, vii) different species of Phlebotomus have post-zygotic barriers, confirming the specific status of Ph. duboscqi, Ph. papatasi, and Ph. bergeroti.

**Investigation of Wolbachia spp in Some Flies Species (Order: Diptera) by PCR**

Saki, CE; Simsek, S. 2014

Wolbachia is a gram negative intracellular parasite from Rickettsia family which is located into reproductive organs of arthropods and transmitted by horizontally and vertically. The aim of this study was to investigate of Wolbachia spp. in different species of flies by PCR. For this aim, 33 females and 15 males of Musca spp., 30 females and 7 males of Lucilia sericata, 16 females and 4 males of Calliphora vicina, 1 female and 4 males of Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis and 27 females and 10 males of Chrysomia albiceps adult flies were used. After the isolation of genomic DNA, the specific primers were used and PCR was performed for the amplification of Wolbachia wsp (Wolbachia surface protein) gene. As a result, the positive control sample yielded 630 bp band while negative control and none of the tested samples yielded band. In conclusion, Wolbachia spp has been molecularly investigated in some Diptera populations for the first time in Turkey.

**Phylogeography of Walnut-Infesting Rhagoletis suavis (Diptera: Tephritidae) Flies**

Glover, MM; Egan, SP; Hood, GR; Rull, J; Aluja, M; Feder, JL. 2018

Discerning the biogeography and historical ranges of organisms is important to understanding the processes causing population divergence and speciation. Mountainous regions in North America have contributed to widespread divergence within animals and plants as species become geographically isolated and diverge. Here, we investigate patterns of divergence for six species of walnut-infesting flies in the Rhagoletis suavis species group (Diptera: Tephritidae) in the United States and Mexico based on sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded Cytochrome Oxidase I and II genes (COI and COII). We resolved the relationship of the newly described species, Rhagoletis ramosae, found in the highlands of Mexico, within the R. suavis species group to test alternate hypotheses of migration and divergence. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis supported a clade in which R. ramosae was most closely related to Rhagoletis zoqui/Rhagoletis completa, found in eastern Mexico. This implies that the Sierra Madre Oriental and not the Sierra Madre Occidental have been a major conduit of migration, isolation, and speciation for walnut flies between Mexico and the United States. Comparisons of mtDNA divergence for R. suavis group flies with the Rhagoletis pomonella and Rhagoletis cingulata species groups suggested that despite current similarities in geographic distributions, these taxa do not share a common biogeographic history, diverging in different regions at different times in the past. Patterns displayed by Rhagoletis flies can be compared to patterns seen in other organisms through the Southwestern and Eastern United States, and Mexico to develop a fuller understanding of the biogeography of these regions of North America.

**Variability and genetic structure ofAnastrepha ludensLoew (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations from Mexico**

Pecina-Quintero, V; Jimenez-Becerril, MF; Ruiz-Salazar, R; Nunez-Colin, CA; Loera-Gallardo, J; Hernandez-Delgado, S; Mayek-Perez, N. 2020

The Mexican fruit fly,Anastrepha ludens(Loew) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is the most devastating pest of citrus in Mexico. Knowledge of the genetic relationships and structure of MexicanA. ludenspopulations is limited. The aim of this research was to characterize the genetic variability and structure of the Mexican fruit fly by using AFLP markers (three EcoRI/MseI primer combinations). The specimens were collected from three hosts, namely,Casimiroa edulisLa Llave & Lex [white sapote],Casimiroa greggii(S. Watson) F. Chiang [yellow chapote], andCitrus Xparadisi (Macfad.) [grapefruit], at four locations in the states of Veracruz (Teocelo and Jalapa), Nuevo Leon (El Jarro), and Tamaulipas (Troncones) in Mexico. A high polymorphism percentage (80.4%) allowed the differentiation of individuals from differentA. ludenspopulations, and high intraspecies genetic variability (DI = 78.4%) was detected. TheA. ludenspopulations clustered into two groups: group one included flies from Veracruz [grapefruit, Jalapa] and Nuevo Leon [yellow chapote, El Jarro], and group two included populations from Tamaulipas [yellow chapote, Troncones] and Veracruz [white sapote, Teocelo]. The populations from group one were from locations at lower altitudes (750 m above sea level), which had warmer (22 degrees C average temperature) and more humid (1470 mm of annual precipitation) climatic conditions than those of group two (1600 m, 18 degrees C and 965 mm). Both population structure and very high genetic differentiation (FST > 0.38) associated with geographical and/or host origin were found inA. ludensfrom Mexico. The genetic differentiation in MexicanA. ludenspopulations suggests reduced gene flow and reproductive isolation resulting either from habitat fragmentation and genetic drift or from natural selection for specific environmental (climate, geography, pest management strategies) or host (chemistry, phenology) condition. Genetic analysis could increase the success ofAnastrephacontrol programs by improving knowledge of host-parasitoid population genetics, allowing matching of parasitoid species to their preferred pest populations.

**Asymmetric reproductive isolation between Lutzomyia pseudolongipalpis and Lutzomyia longipalpis (species C2), Neotropical vectors of visceral leishmaniasis (Diptera: Pshychodidae).**

Arrivillaga, J; Salerno, P; Rangel, Y. 2009

Asymmetric reproductive isolation between Lutzomyia pseudolongipalpis and Lutzomyia longipalpis (species C2), Neotropical vectors of visceral leishmaniasis (Diptera: Pshychodidae). Lutzomyia pseudolongipalpis and Lutzomyia longipalpis (species C2, L. sp n.) are two endemic species of Phlebotominae sand fly vectors From Venezuela. The two insects are sympatric and monophyletic but have deeply diverging, morphological differences. They belong to the L. longipalpis complex. A Study of their reproductive isolation is necessary to understand the process of speciation and maintenance of the two sister species as two discrete taxonomic and biological entities. Cross-mating tests were conducted (homo and hetero-specific) and monitored under two criteria: biological (presence of copulation and offspring) and genetic (using two isozymic markers diagnostic for the L. longipalpis complex; enzyme diagnosis AK and HK). Results indicate reproductive isolation, with an asymmetrical genetic exchange in a direction of **hybrid**ization between the two species under experimental conditions, and production of a low number of heterozygotes. These findings support the existence of negative selection on **hybrid**s, and explain the absence of **hybrid**s under natural conditions, in the sympatric locality. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (1-2): 23-31, Epub 2009 June 30.

**Random Mating among Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae) Adults of Geographically Distant and Ecologically Distinct Populations in Mexico**

Aluja, M; Rull, J; Perez-Staples, D; Diaz-Fleischer, F; Sivinski, J. 2009

The Mexican fruit fly Anastrepha ludens (Loew) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a polyphagous pestiferous insect with a geographical range encompassing highly variable environmental conditions. Considering that cryptic species have been recently found among South American representatives of the same taxonomic group as A. ludens, we tested whether or not some populations of A. ludens have evolved assortative mating as an isolating mechanism that maintains intrapopulation genetic differences and behavioral adaptations to local conditions. Males and females stemming from widely separated locations with similar environmental conditions and males and females stemming from populations within individual-flight range, but collected in different hosts (a native and an exotic one), mated randomly amongst themselves when placed in a field cage. Despite the fact that sibling males and females from two distinct populations also mated randomly amongst themselves, siblings engaged in significantly longer copulations than non-siblings, indicating that perhaps adults discriminated mates with similar genetic compositions. Our results have important practical implications as A. ludens is the most devastating pest of citrus in Mexico and Central America, and large-scale releases of sterile flies are used to control it.

**Ecological divergence among morphologically and genetically related Asphondylia species (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), with new life history data for three congeners including the Alpinia fruit gall midge**

Yukawa, J; Tokuda, M; Uechi, N; Yasuda, K; Ganaha-Kikumura, T; Matsuo, K; Shimizu, Y; Yamaguchi, D. 2019

Ecological data is crucial for determining the degree of reproductive isolation among closely related species, and in identifying the factors that have produced this divergence. We studied life history traits for three Asphondylia (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) species that induce fruit galls either on Alpinia, Ligustrum or Aucuba, and we compared the traits with those published for three other closely related Japanese Asphondylia species. We found that the six species were significantly differentiated in important life history traits, such as host range, voltinism, lower developmental threshold temperature, thermal constant and diapausing season. The data indicate that divergence in the assessed life history traits evolves before morphological divergence, and such ecological divergence could strengthen isolating barriers among the taxa. We present scenarios on how host range expansion, host plant shift and host organ shift for galling initiate the early stages of speciation. We also highlight the importance of ecological data in identifying cryptic species. Specifically, we confirm that Alpinia intermedia (Zingiberaceae) is not an autumn-spring host of the soybean pod gall midge Asphondylia yushimai based on many differences in the life history traits between the Alpinia fruit gall midge Asphondylia sp. and A. yushimai.

**Period Gene of Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) Among Strains with Different Mating Times and Sterile Insect Technique**

Matsumoto, A; Ohta, Y; Itoh, TQ; Sanada-Morimura, S; Matsuyama, T; Fuchikawa, T; Tanimura, T; Miyatake, T. 2008

The efficacy of sterile insect technique (SIT) depends on successful mating of released males with wild females. If the time of mating in a day of mass-reared and released males differs from those of wild females, the efficiency of SIT decreases. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling mating time of the target pests is particularly important for SIT. The period (per) gene, which has been considered as a key clock gene controlling the mating time of the melon fly. Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae), was cloned from two strains having different times of mating during the day. DNA sites varied in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and at synonymous sies, although protein sequences were identical. We also provide phylogenetic relationships among PER protein sequences of dipteran species including several tephritid pest species. The functional domains of PER in the melon fly are very similar to those in other tephritid species. A luciferase reporter assay showed that the melon fly PER can functionally complement that of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen). The results implicate that the major genetic cause of the difference in circadian periods, and thus in reproductive isolation, is probably one or more other clock gene(s). Thus, the series of studies may provide a novel factor concerning genetic quality control of mass-reared insect pests for SIT, which depends on successful mating of released males and wild females.

**The occurrence and preference of Botanophila flies (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) for particular species of Epichloe fungi infecting wild grasses**

Lembicz, M; Gorzynska, K; Olszanowski, Z; Michelsen, V; Leuchtmann, A. 2013

Specific associations between species frequently occur in ecological interactions. The aim of this study was to determine the preferences of anthomyiid flies of the genus Botanophila for particular species of fungi as sites for laying eggs and as food for both larvae and adults. The associations of their eggs, larvae and flies with the stromata of different species of Epichloe fungi infecting 7 species of grass in Poland were analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy of the surface of their eggs and an analysis of the genetic sequences of their mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COII) were used to identify the taxa of the flies studied. Three types of eggs were distinguished based on their shape, colour and the presence of dorsal folds and sculpturing on the shells. Tentatively, these eggs were assigned to the following species: B. laterella, B. phrenione, B. dissecta and B. lobata. COII sequences obtained from larvae that hatched from two of the types of eggs formed three distinct clades associated with the reference sequences for Botanophila phrenione, B. lobata (new to the fauna of Poland) and a putative species, "Taxon 1". Only one of these flies (B. lobata) was restricted to a single species of Epichloe (E. bromicola on Elymus repens); B. phrenione was recorded mainly from E. typhina infecting three different species of grass. The results of this study confirm that there is not a close species specific association between this fungus and this insect.

**Cryptic diversity and gene flow among three African agricultural pests: Ceratitis rosa, Ceratitis fasciventris and Ceratitis anonae (Diptera, Tephritidae)**

Virgilio, M; Delatte, H; Quilici, S; Backeljau, T; De Meyer, M. 2013

The Ceratitis FAR complex' is a species complex of African fruit flies (Diptera, Tephritidae) including the major agricultural pest Ceratitis rosa and the morphologically similar Ceratitis fasciventris and Ceratitis anonae. To resolve their intra- and interspecific genetic relationships and to estimate gene flow within this complex, we surveyed allelic variation at 16 microsatellite loci in 27 African populations of the three morphospecies. Interpopulation genetic distances and individual Bayesian assignments distinguished five genotypic clusters: two involving C.rosa (R1, R2; that may occur in sympatry), two involving C.fasciventris (F1, F2; with parapatric distributions) and one involving C.anonae (A). Intra- and interspecific patterns of genetic differentiation were not hierarchically structured and genetic differentiation between conspecific clusters (F1F2 and R1R2) was higher or comparable with differentiation between heterospecific clusters (e.g. F1-A or R2-A). In some cases, gene flow estimates among morphospecies or among heterospecific genotypic clusters were significantly different from zero, showing the lack of reproductive isolation. Genetic differentiation between genotypic clusters was partly supported by morphological differences observed a posteriori in male secondary sexual characters. These results suggest important revisions to current models of ecological niche requirements and invasion risk of the major agricultural pest C.rosa and provide a basis for a taxonomic re-interpretation of the FAR complex.

**Hidden in the urban parks of New York City: Themira lohmanus, a new species of Sepsidae described based on morphology, DNA sequences, mating behavior, and reproductive isolation (Sepsidae, Diptera)**

Ang, YC; Rajaratnam, G; Su, KFY; Meier, R. 2017

New species from well-studied taxa such as Sepsidae (Diptera) are rarely described from localities that have been extensively explored and one may think that New York City belongs to this category. Yet, a new species of Themira (Diptera: Sepsidae) was recently discovered which is currently only known to reside in two of New York City's largest urban parks. Finding a new species of Themira in these parks was all the more surprising because the genus was revised in 1998 and is not particularly species-rich (13 species). Its status is confirmed as a new species based on morphology, DNA sequences, and reproductive isolation tests with a closely related species, and is described as Themira lohmanus Ang, sp. n. The species breeds on waterfowl dung and it is hypothesized that this makes the species rare in natural environments. However, it thrives in urban parks where the public feeds ducks and geese. The mating behavior of Themira lohmanus was recorded and is similar to the behavior of its closest relative T. biloba.

**Analysis of reproductive isolation between sibling species Anopheles albitarsis sensu stricto and Anopheles deaneorum, two malaria vectors belonging to the Albitarsis complex (Diptera : Culicidae)**

Lima, JBP; Valle, D; Peixoto, AA. 2004

Complexes of sibling species are common among mosquitoes, and their existence within vector species can have important epidemiological consequences. Anopheles albitarsis sensu stricto and Anopheles deaneorum Rosa-Freitas are two putative vectors of malaria parasites belonging to the Albitarsis species complex (Diptera: Culicidae). Using an induced mating technique, we studied the reproductive isolation between these two closely related species and their reciprocal **hybrid**s. Evidence for **hybrid** male sterility consistent with Haldane's rule was found. The results indicate that male **hybrid**s show very low insemination rates, probably due to abnormalities in their reproductive organs. In addition, the data show that **hybrid** males carrying an X chromosome derived from An. deaneorum perform significantly worse than **hybrid** males carrying an An. albitarsis s.s. X chromosome.

**Incipient speciation in the Anastrepha fraterculus cryptic species complex: reproductive compatibility between A. sp.1 aff. fraterculus and A. sp.3 aff. fraterculus**

Roriz, AKP; Japyassu, HF; Joachim-Bravo, IS. 2017

Reproductive isolation among biological strains can be detected by analyzing reproductive barriers between populations. The Anastrepha fraterculus Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae) cryptic species complex comprises eight morphotypes defined by morphometric characteristics. The present study analyzed the existence of pre- and post-zygotic isolation among populations of A. sp.1 aff. fraterculus (A. sp.1) and A. sp.3 aff. fraterculus (A. sp.3) determined by tests of sexual compatibility, analyses of the temporal pattern of calling behavior, and the reproductive performance of the offspring of homotypic and heterotypic crosses. Pre-zygotic tests indicated asymmetric matings with preferences for homotypic crosses. The A. sp.3 population demonstrated distinct characteristics, including low copulation percentages and a high proportion of homotypic copulations under crowded conditions. The females of the A. sp.1 population demonstrated lower copulation latency. The analyzed morphotypes demonstrated two peaks in pheromone emission activity, at the beginning and at the end of the morning and were differentiated in the abundance of males. The calling behavior of the **hybrid**s between A. sp.1 male and A. sp.3 female crosses had an intermediate pattern compared to either parental type. Post-zygotic compatibility tests indicated low viability of the cross between A. sp.3 males and A. sp.1 females. Pronounced asymmetries were found in the sex ratios of the offspring of heterotypic crosses, and only **hybrid**s from A. sp.1 male vs. A. sp.3 female crosses produced descendants. The observed pre- and post-zygotic incompatibilities reflect the probable occurrence of incipient speciation between A. sp.1 and A. sp.3. A more adequate taxonomic classification of this species complex that considers the distinct characteristics of each morphotype will be needed to improve environmentally wise control methods against this insect pest.

**Precopulatory mating and postzygotic isolation between two walnut-infesting species of Rhagoletis from Mexican highlands**

Tadeo, E; Aluja, M; Rull, J. 2018

Pleistocene glacial and postglacial cycles producing contraction and expansion of temperate habitats have resulted in substantial diversification among several plant and animal taxa of Neararctic origin undergoing periods of isolation and secondary contact in high-elevation areas of Mexico. One of such groups are walnut-infesting fruit flies in the genus Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae), comprised of six recently derived species among which phylogenetic relationships have been difficult to unravel using conventional molecular methods. Here, we examined pre- and postzygotic isolation between two genetically similar and morphologically distinct species which are currently parapatric in central Mexico. Local adaptation driven by differences in host plant phenology between Rhagoletis zoqui Bush and Rhagoletis ramosae Hernandez-Ortiz resulted in allochronic isolation. Despite the existence of precopulatory mating isolation, there was a substantial number of **hybrid** matings in field cages where conspecific and heterospecific males and females were simultaneously released. The bulk of mating activity took place on host fruit. Rhagoletis zoqui females were more reluctant to mate with R.ramosae males than with males of their own species. Distinctive behavioral differences were observed between males during contests, fruit guarding, and approach to conspecifics on fruit. There was also some asymmetric postzygotic isolation, with the **hybrid** combination of R.zoqui males and R.ramosae females resulting in lower egg hatch than other mating combinations. Results were consistent with those of a phylogenetic study suggesting recent divergence of R.ramosae from Rhagoletis completa Cresson and R.zoqui in the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Mexican Trans Volcanic Belt.

**Cytogenetics of the Simulium arcticum complex (Diptera: Simuliidae)**

Shields, GF. NA

Descriptions of chromosomal rearrangements, geographic distributions and frequencies of nine siblings and 28 cytotypes of the Simulium arcticum Malloch complex are presented. Findings are based on six data sets that include approximately 21,000 chromosomally analyzed larvae from throughout the known geographic range of S. arcticum. This is the largest chromosomal data set for any North American complex of black flies. This summary emphasizes the need to chromosomally analyze taxa of black flies since this type of analysis can result in, not only, a better understanding of the number of taxa in a complex and their relationships but also, it may help to understand the initial stages of reproductive isolation within otherwise morphologically identical groups. Geographically, the streams of eastern Alaska, the entire province of the Yukon and northern Mexico should be sampled. Taxonomically the many cytotypes should be tested for reproductive status when they occur in sympatry with other siblings and cytotypes of the complex. Finally, comparative multi-omic research would be useful.

**Evidence for spatial clines and mixed geographic modes of speciation for North American cherry-infesting Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) flies**

Doellman, MM; Saint Jean, G; Egan, SP; Powell, THQ; Hood, GR; Schuler, H; Bruzzese, DJ; Glover, MM; Smith, JJ; Yee, WL; Goughnour, R; Rull, J; Aluja, M; Feder, JL. 2020

An important criterion for understanding speciation is the geographic context of population divergence. Three major modes of allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric speciation define the extent of spatial overlap and gene flow between diverging populations. However, mixed modes of speciation are also possible, whereby populations experience periods of allopatry, parapatry, and/or sympatry at different times as they diverge. Here, we report clinal patterns of variation for 21 nuclear-encoded microsatellites and a wing spot phenotype for cherry-infesting Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) across North America consistent with these flies having initially diverged in parapatry followed by a period of allopatric differentiation in the early Holocene. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) displays a different pattern; cherry flies at the ends of the clines in the eastern USA and Pacific Northwest share identical haplotypes, while centrally located populations in the southwestern USA and Mexico possess a different haplotype. We hypothesize that the mitochondrial difference could be due to lineage sorting but more likely reflects a selective sweep of a favorable mtDNA variant or the spread of an endosymbiont. The estimated divergence time for mtDNA suggests possible past allopatry, secondary contact, and subsequent isolation between USA and Mexican fly populations initiated before the Wisconsin glaciation. Thus, the current genetics of cherry flies may involve different mixed modes of divergence occurring in different portions of the fly's range. We discuss the need for additional DNA sequencing and quantification of prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation to verify the multiple mixed-mode hypothesis for cherry flies and draw parallels from other systems to assess the generality that speciation may commonly involve complex biogeographies of varying combinations of allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric divergence.

**Ongoing speciation within the Anastrepha fraterculus cryptic species complex: the case of the Andean morphotype**

Devescovi, F; Abraham, S; Roriz, AKP; Nolazco, N; Castaneda, R; Tadeo, E; Caceres, C; Segura, DF; Vera, MT; Joachim-Bravo, I; Canal, N; Rull, J. 2014

The Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) cryptic species complex is currently composed of seven taxonomically recognized morphotypes. Both, pre- and post-zygotic isolation has been documented among four of these morphotypes, revealing that in fact they appear to be distinct biological entities. In order to progress in the full delimitation of species within the complex, we examined reproductive isolation between a Colombian population of the Andean morphotype and populations belonging to four other morphotypes spanning from Mexico to Argentina. Flies from the Andean morphotype exhibited strong pre-zygoticmating isolation through temporal partitioning of mating activity. Post-zygotic isolation was observed for crosses of males of all morphotypes and Andeanmorphotype females, yetmost of the F1 **hybrid** male F1 **hybrid** female self-crosses showed normal levels of fertility, a finding suggesting a nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction according to previous studies. Overall, the Andean morphotype within the complex also appears to be a distinct biological entity. We discuss the implications of these findings for the understanding of speciation mechanisms in the Neotropical genus Anastrepha.

**SYSTEMATICS AND MODES OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IN THE HOLARCTIC DROSOPHILA-TESTACEA SPECIES GROUP (DIPTERA, DROSOPHILIDAE)**

GRIMALDI, D; JAMES, AC; JAENIKE, J. 1992

Reproductive isolation and morphological differences among allopatric populations of the Holarctic species Drosophila testacea v. Roser indicate that this taxon is actually a complex of three morphocryptic species: D. testacea, from Europe and continental Asia; D. orientacea, n.sp., from Japan; and D. neotestacea, n.sp., from North America. Diagnostically important morphological variation is presented, along with distributional data for these three species and D. putrida Sturtevant, the only other member of the testacea species group. Both pre- and postmating barriers to reproduction were observed in various interspecific crosses. Premating isolation is strongly asymmetric between D. tesiacea and D. neotestacea. Modes of postmating isolation include lack of sperm transfer and failure of **hybrid** eggs to hatch. The revised taxonomy of this group should facilitate analyses of interesting aspects of the evolutionary ecology of these species.

**Cytogenetic and symbiont analysis of five members of the B-dorsalis complex (Diptera, Tephritidae): no evidence of chromosomal or symbiont-based speciation events**

Augustinos, AA; Drosopoulou, E; Gariou-Papalexiou, A; Asimakis, ED; Caceres, C; Tsiamis, G; Bourtzis, K; Mavragani-Tsipidou, P; Zacharopoulou, A. 2015

The Bactrocera dorsalis species complex, currently comprising about 90 entities has received much attention. During the last decades, considerable effort has been devoted to delimiting the species of the complex. This information is of great importance for agriculture and world trade, since the complex harbours several pest species of major economic importance and other species that could evolve into global threats. Speciation in Diptera is usually accompanied by chromosomal rearrangements, particularly inversions that are assumed to reduce/eliminate gene flow. Other candidates currently receiving much attention regarding their possible involvement in speciation are reproductive symbionts, such as Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Arsenophonus, Rickettsia and Cardinium. Such symbionts tend to spread quickly through natural populations and can cause a variety of phenotypes that promote pre-mating and/or post-mating isolation and, in addition, can affect the biology, physiology, ecology and evolution of their insect hosts in various ways. Considering all these aspects, we present: (a) a summary of the recently gained knowledge on the cytogenetics of five members of the B. dorsalis complex, namely B. dorsalis s.s., B. invadens, B. philippinensis, B. papayae and B. carambolae, supplemented by additional data from a B dorsalis s.s. colony from China, as well as by a cytogenetic comparison between the dorsalis complex and the genetically close species, B. tryoni, and, (b) a reproductive symbiont screening of 18 different colonized populations of these five taxa. Our analysis did not reveal any chromosomal rearrangements that could differentiate among them. Moreover, screening for reproductive symbionts was negative for all colonies derived from different geographic origins and/or hosts. There are many different factors that can lead to speciation, and our data do not support chromosomal and/or symbiotic-based speciation phenomena in the taxa under study.

**Reproductive isolation between sympatric and allopatric Brazilian populations of Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. (Diptera : Psychodidae)**

Souza, NA; Andrade-Coelho, CA; Vigoder, FM; Ward, RD; Peixoto, AA. 2008

Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l., the main vector of Leishmania chagasi in Latin America, is a species complex although the exact number of siblings is yet unknown. In Brazil, the siblings differ in male copulatory courtship songs and pheromones that most certainly act as pre-zygotic reproductive barriers. Here we analysed the reproductive isolation between three allopatric and two sympatric populations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. from Brazil. The results indicate a strong copulatory and pre-mating isolation between the three allopatric populations. In addition, the results also indicate a stronger pre-mating isolation between the two sympatric siblings than between the three allopatric ones, suggesting a role for reinforcement in the speciation of the Lu. longipalpis s.l. complex.

**Infections with Wolbachia and Spiroplasma in the Scathophagidae and other Muscoidea**

Martin, OY; Gubler, A; Wimmer, C; Gerrnann, C; Bernasconi, MV. 2012

The microbes Wolbachia and Spiroplasma are common reproductive parasites of arthropods and may strongly influence reproduction of infected hosts and also impact on reproductive isolation. Such infections could hence influence results of many studies assessing reproductive behaviour and fitness of possible hosts, as well as reproductive isolation. Previous work indicates that infections with the microbes Wolbachia and Spiroplasma are common in the Drosophilidae. However, extensive and targeted surveys of other Dipteran families are lacking. Here we survey the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria and a range of other species from the Muscoidea (families Scathophagidae, Anthomyiidae, Fanniidae and Muscidae) collected in the field or obtained from museum collections for infection with the widespread reproductive parasites Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. Both have been shown to be heritable symbionts and affect reproduction in other Diptera. S. stercoraria is a very important model for the study of sexual selection, and in particular of postcopulatory processes, as it has played a major role in the history of research on sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Infections with Wolbachia were found to be widespread across the Muscoidea, whereas infections with Spiroplasma were rarer. We discuss the consequences of these findings and directions for future research on the impact of reproductive parasites on host reproduction in the Scathophagidae. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

**The "wingbeat hypothesis" of reproductive isolation between members of the Anopheles gambiae complex (Diptera : Culicidae) does not fly**

Tripet, F; Dolo, G; Traore, S; Lanzaro, GC. 2004

Recent advances have demonstrated that, in the absence of postmating barriers to **hybrid**ization, reproductive isolation between different forms of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is maintained by strong assortative mating. The forms of An. gambiae s.s. and the sister species An. arabiensis commonly form mixed swarms in which they mate. This raises the question as to how individuals recognize mates of their own species or form within swarms. It has been proposed that wingbeat frequency is used as a cue to discriminate potential mates. This has important implications for prospective genetic control programs. We used a photosensor to record the transient waveforms generated by individuals An. arabiensis and from the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. as they flew through a beam of light. We found no significant between-species or between-form differences in the fundamental harmonic-equivalent to wingbeat frequency-either in males or females collected from sympatric populations in Mali, West Africa. However, there were significant differences in the amplitude of the first and third harmonics in females and of the first and second harmonics in males. Whereas these results suggest some morphological or behavioral differences between species and forms, the extensive overlap in the distributions of harmonic amplitudes does not point to them as reliable cues for assortative mating. Combining all waveforms parameters into a discriminant analysis did not yield characteristic scores either for males or females. Thus, our results do not support the wingbeat hypothesis of premating isolation in the An. gambiae complex.

**From 'cryptic species' to integrative taxonomy: an iterative process involving DNA sequences, morphology, and behaviour leads to the resurrection of Sepsis pyrrhosoma (Sepsidae: Diptera)**

Tan, DSH; Ang, Y; Lim, GS; Bin Ismail, MR; Meier, R. 2010

Tan, D. S. H., Ang Y., Lim, G. S., Ismail, M. R. B. & Meier, R. (2010). Front 'cryptic species' to integrative taxonomy: an iterative process involving DNA sequences, morphology, and behaviour leads to the resurrection of Sepsis pyrrhosoma (Sepsidae: Diptera). - Zoologica Scripta, 39, 51-61. The increased availability of DNA sequences has led to a surge of 'cryptic Species in the literature. These units are usually proposed based on finding genetically distinct lineages within species that were initially defined based oil morphological characters. However, few authors attempt to confirm whether these 'cryptic' units are species and even fewer authors are explicit about which species concept is applied. Here, we use an example from Sepsidae (Diptera) to demonstrate how cryptic species call be validated by all iterative process involving several data sources and an evaluation of the data under different species concepts. A phylogeographic analysis based oil 50 specimens for five species of the flavimana group revealed deep mitochondrial splits within Sepsis flavimana which was suggestive of a cryptic species. We resolve the initial conflict between DNA sequences and morphology I)v adding new morphological data is well as behavioural evidence and tests for reproductive isolation. One cryptic species is confirmed and Sepsis pyrrhosoma, a former synonym of S. flavimana, is here shown to be a valid species under most species concepts. We call thus document that the same data call lead to similar conclusions under conflicting concepts once different kinds of data are integrated.

**Evolutionary neuroecology of olfactory-mediated sexual communication and host specialization in Drosophila - a review**

Khallaf, MA; Knaden, M. 2022

In humans, finding a partner is quite a difficult task because there are many criteria that one needs to consider. However, in comparison to many animals, when choosing a partner, we easily discriminate between ourselves and members of other species through various communication systems. On the contrary, many fly species (Diptera) are morphologically similar and overlap in their geographical distributions and ecological habitats. Sexual interactions of most drosophilid flies occur on their hosts. Therefore, flies rely on olfactory sex pheromones, as well as on non-pheromonal chemicals such as host volatiles - which guide and restrict the search for conspecifics within limited locations - as honest signals for pre-mating reproductive isolation. A subtle divergence in the perception of these signals can lead to accumulated changes among populations of the same species, and ultimately to a reduction in gene flow and reproductive isolation. In recent years, we have seen an increased interest in how olfactory systems diverge to drive host adaptation and speciation. In this review, we discuss the evolutionary changes of the neural circuits that underlie mate recognition. We shed light onto sex pheromone communication systems, the construction of olfactory nervous systems, and the role of host specialization in reproductive isolation. Finally, leveraging the incipient speciation of Drosophila mojavensis Patterson populations, we highlight the underlying sensory mechanisms of the reproductive isolation barriers. In the end, we propose future research topics of the evolutionary neuroecology field of sexual communication.

**From kissing to belly stridulation: comparative analysis reveals surprising diversity, rapid evolution, and much homoplasy in the mating behaviour of 27 species of sepsid flies (Diptera: Sepsidae)**

Puniamoorthy, N; Ismail, MRB; Tan, DSH; Meier, R. 2009

Our understanding of how fast mating behaviour evolves in insects is rather poor due to a lack of comparative studies among insect groups for which phylogenetic relationships are known. Here, we present a detailed study of the mating behaviour of 27 species of Sepsidae (Diptera) for which a well-resolved and supported phylogeny is available. We demonstrate that mating behaviour is extremely diverse in sepsids with each species having its own mating profile. We define 32 behavioural characters and document them with video clips. Based on sister species comparisons, we provide several examples where mating behaviour evolves faster than all sexually dimorphic morphological traits. Mapping the behaviours onto the molecular tree reveals much homoplasy, comparable to that observed for third positions of mitochondrial protein-encoding genes. A partitioned Bremer support (PBS) analysis reveals conflict between the molecular and behavioural data, but behavioural characters have higher PBS values per parsimony-informative character than DNA sequence characters.

**Hybrid syndrome-induced postzygotic reproductive isolation: A second reproduction barrier in Chironomus thummi (Diptera, Chironomidae)**

Hagele, K. 1999

The frequency of the occurrence of **hybrid**s between Chironomus thummi thummi and Chironomus thummi piger is estimated to be 0.047% in the wild. The rare **hybrid**ization events are the consequence of the sexual isolation mechanism of different swarming behavior of thummi and piger. Under laboratory conditions **hybrid**s are easily obtained. The reciprocal **hybrid**s show two different dysgenesis syndromes depending on the direction of crosses. The Rud syndrome reduces the number of fertile thummi (f) x piger (m) **hybrid**s to less than 2% by rudimentary gonads, and the HLE syndrome the number of Fertile piger (f) x thummi (tn) **hybrid**s to 12% by a reduction of the hatching frequency of the **hybrid** larvae. The overall frequency of the occurrence of **hybrid**s in the wild that are able to reproduce is estimated to be 0.0033%. In backcrosses of the **hybrid**s with the parental strains a further fertility reduction of 40% occurs. Thus, the two syndromes operate postzygoticaly as an effective second reproductive isolation mechanism that evolved most probably as an important prerequisite of speciation.

**Distinct Adult Eclosion Traits of Sibling Species Rhagoletis pomonella and Rhagoletis zephyria (Diptera: Tephritidae) Under Laboratory Conditions**

Yee, WL; Goughnour, RB; Feder, JL. 2021

Closely related phytophagous insects that specialize on different host plants may have divergent responses to environmental factors. Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) and Rhagoletis zephyria Snow (Diptera: Tephritidae) are sibling, sympatric fly species found in western North America that attack and mate on plants of Rosaceae (similar to 60 taxa) and Caprifoliaceae (three taxa), respectively, likely contributing to partial reproductive isolation. Rhagoletis zephyria evolved from R. pomonella and is native to western North America, whereas R. pomonella was introduced there. Given that key features of the flies' ecology, breeding compatibility, and evolution differ, we predicted that adult eclosion patterns of the two flies from Washington State, USA are also distinct. When puparia were chilled, eclosion of apple- and black hawthorn-origin R. pomonella was significantly more dispersed, with less pronounced peaks, than of snowberry-origin R. zephyria within sympatric and nonsympatric site comparisons. Percentages of chilled puparia that produced adults were >= 67% for both species. However, when puparia were not chilled, from 13.5 to 21.9% of apple-origin R. pomonella versus only 1.2% to 1.9% of R. zephyria eclosed.The distinct differences in eclosion traits of R. pomonella and R. zephyria could be due to greater genetic variation in R. pomonella, associated with its use of a wider range of host plants than R. zephyria.

**Revision of Asian species of the Drosophila melanica species group (Diptera: Drosophilidae), with a description of a new species from Vietnam**

Suwito, A; Toda, MJ; Takamori, H; Harada, K; Watabe, H. 2014

A new species of the Drosophila (Drosophila) melanica species group (Diptera: Drosophilidae), Drosophila denruoiSuwito & Watabe, sp. nov., is described from northern Vietnam. It is proved by crossing experiments that reproductive isolation is complete between this species and other morphologically similar species. Larval ganglion cells of D.denruoi possess 2n=12 chromosomes, comprised of four pairs of acrocentric, one pair of metacentric and one pair of micro-chromosomes. This is the largest number of acrocentric chromosomes in the group and implies that the species has the most primitive chromosomal configuration in the melanica group. Based on the results of crossing experiments and close morphological examination, Drosophila pengiOkada & Kurokawa, 1957 from central Japan, once regarded as a synonym of Drosophila tsiganaBurla & Gloor, 1952, is shown to be distinct from D.tsigana. Drosophila pengi is thus resurrected as a member of the melanica group. We synonymize Drosophila bisetataToda, 1988, described from central Myanmar, with D.pengi. In addition, a population from Guizhou, southwestern China, once regarded as D.tsigana, is also identified as D.pengi. These populations from central Myanmar and southwestern China share the diagnostic characters of D.pengi. At the same time, it is reconfirmed that the Hokkaido population is conspecific with European D.tsigana. Furthermore, another species, Drosophila longiserrataToda, 1988 described from central Myanmar, is synonymized with Drosophila aferTan, Hsu & Sheng, 1949 from China, based on their having identical karyotypes and external morphology.

**A genetic-morphological characterization of two cryptic species of the Anastrepha fraterculus complex (Diptera : Tephritidae)**

Selivon, D; Perondini, ALP; Morgante, JS. 2005

Biological characteristics of two entities of the Anastrepha fraterculus complex (Diptera: Tephritidae), referred to in previous publications as A. sp.1 aff.fraterculus and A. sp.2 aff.fraterculus, were further studied by a combined analysis of isozymes, karyotypes, morphometry, and crossings, in samples from 10 Brazilian populations. A survey of 16 enzymatic systems comprising 19 loci showed significant differences in the allele frequencies at four loci, FUM, ME, HEX, and LDH, allowing the recognition of two population clusters. These clusters also differ in their karyotypes, especially in the length of the sex chromosomes and in the size and location of heterochromatic regions. A morpho-metric analysis of wings and the aculeux in samples from five populations clearly showed a distinction between the two clusters but not between populations within each cluster. A phenetic analysis based on the Mahalanobis distance matrix also arranged the populations into the same two clusters. Crosses between populations of the same cluster showed no significant differences in egg hatching and in the adult sex ratio. However, a significant decrease in egg hatching was observed in the intercluster crosses. In crosses of cluster 1 males to cluster 2 females, a significant deviation in the sex ratio was observed according to Haldane's rule, but not in the reciprocal crosses, indicating that a certain degree of reproductive isolation occurs between populations of cluster1 and cluster 2. The results indicate that the two population clusters actually represent two cryptic species of the nominal species Anastrepha fraterculus, corroborating previous studies on this complex. We propose that the denominations A. sp.1 aff.fraterculus and A. sp.2 aff.fraterculus should be maintained until an appropriate taxonomic revision is made.

**Taxonomy and phylogeny of the Asphondylia species (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) of North American goldenrods: challenging morphology, complex host associations, and cryptic speciation**

Dorchin, N; Joy, JB; Hilke, LK; Wise, MJ; Abrahamson, WG. 2015

Reproductive isolation and speciation in herbivorous insects may be accomplished via shifts between host-plant resources: either plant species or plant organs. The intimate association between gall-inducing insects and their host plants makes them particularly useful models in the study of speciation. North American goldenrods (Asteraceae: Solidago and Euthamia) support a rich fauna of gall-inducing insects. Although several of these insects have been the subject of studies focusing on speciation and tritrophic interactions, others remain unstudied and undescribed. Among the latter are at least seven species of the large, cosmopolitan gall midge genus AsphondyliaLoew (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), the taxonomy and biology of which are elucidated here for the first time using morphological, molecular, and life-history data. We describe Asphondylia pseudorosasp.nov., Asphondylia rosulatasp.nov., and Asphondylia silvasp.nov., and redescribe Asphondylia monachaOsten Sacken, 1869 and Asphondylia solidaginisBeutenmuller, 1907, using morphological characters of adults, immature stages, and galls, as well as sequence data from both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. A neotype is designated for A.solidaginis, the type series of which is considered lost. We also provide information on the life history of all species, including a description of two inquilinous cecidomyiids commonly found in the galls, Clinodiplosis comitissp.nov. and Youngomyia podophyllae (Felt, 1907), and on parasitoid wasps associated with the gall midges. Asphondylia johnsoni Felt, 1908, which was described from an unknown gall on an unknown Solidago host, is assigned to nomina dubia. Our phylogenetic analyses show that some of the Asphondylia species associated with goldenrods induce two different types of galls during their life cycle, some exhibit host alterations, and some do both. In the absence of reliable morphological differences, recognising species boundaries and deciphering host associations of species must rely heavily on molecular data. Our analysis suggests that radiation in this group has been recent and occurred through shifts among host plants.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London

**Evaluating the effect of postmating isolation between molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae (Diptera : Culicidae)**

Diabate, A; Dabire, RK; Millogo, N; Lehmann, T. 2007

Multiple families representing all possible combinations of crosses between the two molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto Giles and their **hybrid**s were set up using forced mating between offspring of wild-collected females. The results showed that the reproductive output of **hybrid**s and their backcrosses was similar to that of the pure forms as measured by egg batch size, hatching rate, and larval development success. No sex ratio distortion was found among the offspring. We concluded that postmating developmental barriers do not contribute to the isolation between the molecular forms.

**Geographic and behavioural isolation promote the differentiation of parapatric host-associated forms in bud-galling midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae)**

Danon, G; Ben-Shlomo, R; Keidar, N; Dorchin, N. 2017

Host-associated differentiation (HAD) is widely recognized as a step towards speciation in phytophagous insects because adaptations to different host plants often lead to reproductive isolation. Various pre-mating and post-mating barriers can reduce gene flow between host-associated populations (HAPs), but establishing their relative contribution and the order in which they took effect during speciation is difficult, because thorough information is needed on past and present distribution ranges, behaviour and life history of the taxa involved. We investigated evidence for HAD in the gall-midge Dasyneuriola sp., which induces bud galls on the parapatric desert shrubs Suaeda fruticosa and Suaeda asphaltica in Israel. Based on mitochondrial sequence and amplified fragment length polymorphism analyses, we show that the populations from the two host plants are at an early stage of separation resulting from geographic and behavioural barriers between them. There was no assortative mating between the HAPs, but asymmetry between them was found in host fidelity by ovipositing females and in larval performance on the host plants. Together with findings on attack levels by natural enemies, these findings suggest that the original host plant in this system was S. asphaltica. We conclude that genetic differentiation in Dasyneuriola sp. was probably triggered by geographic separation, manifested by altitudinal rather than simple geographic distances, and that ecological barriers currently promote further divergence between the HAPs.

**Reproductive isolation between Anastrepha bistrigata and A-striata (Diptera, Tephritidae)**

Selivon, D; Morgante, J. 1997

The reproductive isolation between two closely related species, Anastrepha bistrigata and A. striata, was studied in the laboratory. Interespecific copulation attempts were observed, but examination of the spermathecae showed that sperm transference did not occur, even after a prolonged period of contact between the mating pairs. These results indicate prezygotic isolation. The analysis of the hourly distribution of mating activities under laboratory conditions, here described for the first time for A. bistrigata, clearly showed differences for the two species, the activities being concentrated in the afternoon period for A. striata and in the morning for A. bistrigata.

**Egg size and hybrid syndrome-dependent embryo mortality in Chironomus hybrids (Diptera : Chironomidae)**

Hagele, K; Kasper-Sonnenberg, M. 2000

Female **hybrid**s of the cross Chironomus t. thummi female x Ch. t. piger male which are largely affected by the sterility inducing Rud syndrome were backcrossed with males of both parental strains. The aim of the study was to provide information about those egg volumes that are insufficient for a normal embryogenesis and to ascertain whether in the **hybrid**s the lethally small egg size represents a new abnormal trait of the Rud syndrome. The egg masses obtained contain eggs of very different sizes with volumes ranging from 0.5 nl to 3.49 nl. Embryo mortality is unusually frequent in those eggs of the backcrosses and of the parental strains that have volumes smaller than 1.5 nl. An egg volume of 1.5 nl represents in Ch. thummi the lower limit for those volumes that are sufficient for a normal embryogenesis. Mortality increases with decreasing egg size, reaching 100% in backcross eggs with volumes of 0.99 nl and smaller. Small egg size is a new trait of the Rud syndrome affected thummi female x piger male **hybrid**s. This trait is part of a postzygotic reproductive isolation barrier between thummi and piger and manifests first in the backcrosses. Most backcross eggs show volumes between 1.5 nl and 2.99 nl. Within this volume range the amount of mortality does not depend upon egg volume. Here, embryo death is great in the backcrosses but normal in the parental strains. The high frequency of embryo death in the backcrosses must be predominantly due to the action of the Rud syndrome and a second **hybrid** syndrome, called HLE syndrome. Since further characteristic traits of these syndromes could be detected in surviving backcross individuals, the study demonstrates the occurrence of the syndromes in this generation also. Therefore, the postzygotic reproductive isolation mechanism of both **hybrid** syndromes is effective in the **hybrid**s and in their progeny as well.

**The diapause response of Rhagoletis pomonella to varying environmental conditions and its significance for geographic and host plant-related adaptation**

Feder, JL; Powell, THQ; Filchak, K; Leung, B. 2010

The recent shift of Rhagoletis pomonella Walsh (Diptera: Tephritidae) from its ancestral host hawthorn to apple is a model for incipient sympatric speciation in action. Previous studies have shown that changes in the over-wintering pupal diapause are critical for differentially adapting R. pomonella flies to a difference in the fruiting times of apples vs. hawthorns, generating ecologically based reproductive isolation. Here, we exposed pupae of the hawthorn race to various combinations of pre- and over-wintering rearing conditions and analyzed their effects on eclosion time and genetics. We report certain unexpected results in regards to a combination of brief pre-winter and over-wintering periods indicative of gene*environment interactions requiring a reassessment of our current understanding of R. pomonella diapause. We present a hypothesis that involves physiological factors related to stored energy reserves in pupae that influences the depth and duration of Rhagoletis diapause. This 'pupal energy reserve' hypothesis can account for our findings and help clarify the role host plant-related life history adaptation plays in phytophage biodiversity.

**Mating time of the west Indian fruit fly Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) (Diptera : tephritidae) under laboratory conditions**

Henning, F; Matioli, SR. 2006

Allochronic reproductive isolation seems to be an important factor in speciation processes in Tephritidae since specific mating times are a widespread feature of its species. The timing of matings of the West Indian fruit fly, Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) was investigated through group-focal observations, during ten days, under laboratory conditions. The number of observed matings and males exhibiting calling behavior varied significantly according to time of day. Sexual activities seemed to be concentrated in the afternoon period, with the male calling behavior reaching a peak between 3:3.30p.m. and 4:30p.m., and mating occurred most frequently from 2:00p.m. to 4:30p.m.

**Chromosomal Translocations in Black Flies (Diptera: Simuliidae)-Facilitators of Adaptive Radiation?**

Adler, PH; Yadamsuren, O; Procunier, WS. 2016

A macrogenomic investigation of a Holarctic clade of black flies-the Simulium cholodkovskii lineage-provided a platform to explore the implications of a unique, synapomorphic whole-arm interchange in the evolution of black flies. Nearly 60 structural rearrangements were discovered in the polytene complement of the lineage, including 15 common to all 138 analyzed individuals, relative to the central sequence for the entire subgenus Simulium. Three species were represented, of which two Palearctic entities (Simulium cholodkovskii and S. decimatum) were sympatric; an absence of **hybrid**s confirmed their reproductive isolation. A third (Nearctic) entity had nonhomologous sex chromosomes, relative to the other species, and is considered a separate species, for which the name Simulium nigricoxum is revalidated. A cytophylogeny is inferred and indicates that the two Palearctic taxa are sister species and these, in turn, are the sister group of the Nearctic species. The rise of the S. cholodkovskii lineage encompassed complex chromosomal and genomic restructuring phenomena associated with speciation in black flies, viz. expression of one and the same rearrangement as polymorphic, fixed, or sex linked in different species; taxon-specific differentiation of sex chromosomes; and reciprocal translocation of chromosome arms. The translocation is hypothesized to have occurred early in male spermatogonia, with the translocated chromosomal complement being transmitted to the X- and Y-bearing sperm during spermatogenesis, resulting in alternate disjunction of viable F1 translocation heterozygotes and the eventual formation of more viable and selectable F2 translocation homozygous progeny. Of 11 or 12 independently derived whole-arm interchanges known in the family Simuliidae, at least six are associated with subsequent speciation events, suggesting a facilitating role of translocations in adaptive radiations. The findings are discussed in the context of potential structural and functional interactions for future genomic research.

**Genetic and phenotypic differentiation suggests incipient speciation within Drosophila arizonae> (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Rampasso, AS; Markow, TA; Richmond, MP. 2017

The cactophilic sister species Drosophila arizonae and Drosophila mojavensis, distributed across southwestern USA, Mexico and Guatemala, constitute a well-suited model to study ecology, genetic divergence and speciation. Although D. arizonae is the more broadly distributed of the two, its evolutionary biology has been less intensively investigated than D. mojavensis. Given the important role of genitalic variation in reproductive isolation, we explored the relationship between male aedeagus morphology and genetic differentiation of geographically distinct strains of D. arizonae. We used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data to establish the phylogenetic relationships among different D. arizonae strains and compared morphological variation, using elliptic Fourier descriptors, among five populations. Our results indicate that the Tuxtla Guti,rrez, Chiapas, population may be at the early stages of lineage divergence. Tuxtla Guti,rrez was the only locality sampled south of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, both of which have been implicated as gene flow barriers in other organisms. Our results suggest that D. arizonae is an emerging model system for studies of incipient speciation.

**When ecological isolation breaks down: sexual isolation is an incomplete barrier to hybridization between Rhagoletis species**

Schwarz, D; McPheron, BA. 2007

Question: Environmental disturbance can disrupt habitat choice as an ecological barrier to **hybrid**ization between host-specific parasites that mate on their host. Is environment-independent mate choice a sufficient barrier to prevent **hybrid**ization when ecological isolation breaks down? Hypothesis: Males and females will not discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific mating partners in the absence of host cues. Study system: Rhagoletis mendax and R. zephyria (Diptera: Tephritidae). **Hybrid**ization between these two taxa resulted in the Lonicera fly, an example of **hybrid** speciation in animals. The Lonicera fly is found only on non-native honeysuckle. Rhagoletis mendax and R. Zephyria discriminate against each other's host but not honeysuckle. This suggests the local breakdown of reproductive isolation via host choice following the introduction of an invasive plant. Methods: We combined males and females of both species in a multi-choice experiment in the laboratory and recorded mating events. Conclusion: Without host plant cues, mate choice is an incomplete barrier to **hybrid**ization. Reproductive isolation between host-specific parasites can be influenced by environmental disturbance because a non-ecological barrier (mate choice) alone is too weak to maintain reproductive isolation.

**A Taxonomic Reassessment of the Phlebotomus argentipes Species Complex (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae)**

Ilango, K. 2010

The taxonomic status of the sand fly Phlebotomus (Euphlebotomus) argentipes Annandale & Brunette 1908, which transmits Leishmania (Leshmania) donovani (Laveran & Mesnil 1903) in southern Asia, is reassessed, because variation in morphology, behavior, and distribution Suggests it to be a complex of sibling species. The putative complex is composed of the nominotypical member, p Phlebotomus argentipes sensu Stricto, Phlebotomus annandalei Sinton 1923 status revived and Phlebotomus glaucus Mitra & Roy 1953 new status. An allolectotype is designated for the female of P. argentipes as well as neotypes for the males of P. annandalei and P. glaucus. Morphological descriptions, illustrations, and keys are presented to allow identification of adult males and females. Based on female morphological characters, P. argentipes s.s., P. annandalei and P. glaucus can be distinguished from each other using principal component analysis. P. glaucus is widespread in India, occurring sympatrically with P. argentipes s.s. in L. donovani-endemic foci, whereas P. annandeli is peripatric to the type species in Chennai, Southern India. "In copula" is a process of postcopulatory sexual selection occurring as correlated coevolution of male and female reproductive traits, which drives species isolation. This pattern has been implicated in reproductive isolation among the members of the P. argentipes complex. Further research on adult behavior and larval biology of the P. argentipes complex is needed to understand the epidemiology and control of visceral leishmaniasis.

**Mating incompatibility among populations of the South American fruit fly Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera : Tephritidae)**

Vera, MT; Caceres, C; Wornoayporn, V; Islam, A; Robinson, AS; De La Vega, MH; Hendrichs, J; Cayol, JP. 2006

Mating compatibility among different populations of the South American fruit fly Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) was assessed through mating tests in pairwise combinations. Screened cages, inside a greenhouse, containing Citrus limon (L,) trees were used. Mating compatibility was determined using the index of sexual isolation. Most of the populations were noncompatible with each other and thus sexually isolated. Of these, Tucuman (Argentina) and Piracicaba (Brazil) populations showed a lower degree of isolation, whereas the other tested combinations were highly isolated. Full mating compatibility was detected only between two Argentinean (Concordia and Tucuman) and two Peruvian populations (La Molina and Piura + La Molina). Flies were sexually active at different times: Tucuman, Concordia, and Piracicaba populations presented an early morning peak, La Molina and Piura + La Molina were active around midday, and Ibague (Colombia) were active late in the afternoon. Manipulation of light phase conditions to match the times of maximum sexual activity did not increase the compatibility between La Molina and Tucuman. Based on these behavioral results, which confirm morphometric, genetic, and other evidence, the taxonomic revision of this cryptic species complex is warranted. One practical implication is that colonies of this pest to be used in any sterile insect technique approach should be derived from the target population or from a compatible population. Regional efforts should be initiated to determine the distribution of each subgroup and their relationship with each other in terms of compatibility.

**Divergent preferences of Rhagoletis pomonella host races for olfactory and visual fruit cues**

Forbes, AA; Feder, JL. 2006

The apple and hawthorn-infesting host races of Rhagoletis pomonella Walsh (Diptera: Tephritidae) represent a model for incipient sympatric speciation. Recent studies have shown that apple and hawthorn flies differ in their responses to host-fruit odor. Each host race preferentially orients to the volatile chemicals emanating from the surface of its natal fruit and is antagonized by non-natal fruit volatiles. Fruit odor discrimination is evolutionarily important due to its contributory role in host-specific mating, generating partial premating reproductive isolation between the races in sympatry. Visual cues are also involved in R. pomonella host searching, yet the extent to which they are used to discriminate between hosts has not been fully resolved, nor has their interaction with olfactory cues. Here, we report results from a series of two-way choice experiments conducted in the field on resident apple and hawthorn flies at a site near Fennville, MI, USA. Four key findings emerged from the study: (1) both olfactory and (2) visual cues increased host discrimination of apple and hawthorn flies for their respective natal fruit, (3) the presence of a single appropriate volatile blend on a natal or non-natal visual model generally increased the ability of flies to discriminate for their natal fruit, and (4) the presence of both natal and non-natal olfactory cues on fruit models did not enhance host discrimination above levels observed for visual models alone. We discuss the implications of our results for interpreting the findings of two-way host choice experiments and for sympatric speciation in phytophagous insects.

**Host-associated differentiation in reproductive behaviour of cecidomyiid midges on cranberry and blueberry**

Cook, MA; Ozeroff, SN; Fitzpatrick, SM; Roitberg, BD. 2011

In British Columbia, Canada, Dasineura oxycoccana Johnson (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) was initially found on highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L. (Ericaceae) and has recently become a pest of cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton, a crop that is often found in close proximity with blueberry. Previous work has shown no temporal isolation and a potential for gene flow between these two D. oxycoccana populations. However, important behavioural differences were observed suggesting the potential for host races or cryptic species. Host races and cryptic species differ in their degree of assortative mating and reproductive isolation from partial to complete. We assessed whether populations of adult D. oxycoccana on these two crops would discriminate against mates from different natal hosts. Mating experiments were conducted within the greenhouse in 2010 using small glass vials without host plants present. Our results show D. oxycoccana from cranberry and blueberry hosts displayed complete assortative mating in the absence of their host plants. Behavioural data collected from the different crosses suggest these two D. oxycoccana populations differ in sex pheromones and close-range 'courtship pheromones'. We conclude that D. oxycoccana populations on cranberry and blueberry in British Columbia are reproductively isolated and probably represent cryptic species.

**Geographic patterns of postzygotic isolation between two closely related widespread dung fly species (Sepsis cynipsea and Sepsis neocynipsea; Diptera: Sepsidae)**

Giesen, A; Schafer, MA; Blanckenhorn, WU. 2019

Identifying the contribution of pre- and postzygotic barriers to gene flow is a key goal of speciation research. The widespread dung fly species Sepsis cynipsea and Sepsis neocynipsea offer great potential for studying the speciation process over a range of opportunities for gene exchange within and across sister species (cross-continental allopatry, continental parapatry and sympatry). We examined the role of postcopulatory isolating barriers by comparing female fecundity and egg-to-adult viability of F-1 and F-2 **hybrid**s, as well as backcrosses of F-1 **hybrid**s with the parental species, via replicated crosses of sym-, para- and allopatric populations. Egg-to-adult viability was strongly but not totally suppressed in **hybrid**s, and offspring production approached nil in the F-2 generation (**hybrid** breakdown), indicating yet unspecified intrinsic incompatibilities. Viable F-1 **hybrid** offspring showed almost absolute male (the heterogametic sex) sterility while females remained largely fertile, in accordance with Haldane's rule. **Hybrid**ization between the two species in European areas of sympatry (Swiss Alps) indicated only minor reinforcement based on fecundity traits. Crossing geographically isolated European and North American S. neocynipsea showed similar albeit weaker isolating barriers that are most easily explained by random genetic drift. We conclude that in this system with a biogeographic continuum of reproductive barriers, speciation is mediated primarily by genetic drift following dispersal of flies over a wide (allopatric) geographic range, with some role of natural or sexual selection in incidental or direct reinforcement of incompatibility mechanisms in areas of European sympatry. S(ubs)pecies status of continental S. neocynipsea appears warranted.

**Phylogeography of the parasitic fly Batrachomyia in the Wet Tropics of north-east Australia, and susceptibility of host frog lineages in a mosaic contact zone**

Hoskin, CJ; Mccallum, H. 2007

Parasites could differentially impact intraspecific host lineages due to genetic, phenotypic, ecological, or behavioural differences between the lineages, or the development of reproductive isolation between them. Batrachomyia (Diptera: Chloropidae) are flies that exclusively parasitize Australian frogs, and in the Wet Tropics rainforest of north-east Australia larvae are largely restricted to the green-eyed tree frog Litoria genimaculata (Anura: Hylidae). This frog species consists of two highly divergent genetic lineages that overlap in two nearby, but independent, contact zones. At one contact zone there has been extensive phenotypic divergence and speciation between the lineages whereas, at the other contact relatively lower levels of phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation suggest that speciation has not occurred. In the present study we tested: (1) whether the deep phylogeographic divergence between northern and southern host populations is mirrored by congruent genetic structuring in the parasite populations and (2) whether the host lineages are differentially impacted by parasitism. We found that the two divergent frog lineages are parasitized by a single lineage of Batrachomyia, which exhibits strikingly little phylogeographic structuring. We found a significant difference in Batrachomyia prevalence between the host lineages at mixed lineage sites in both contact zones, with the magnitude and direction of this effect being consistent in both. The pattern did not differ between the two contacts even though recent phenotypic divergence and speciation has occurred between the lineages at one contact but not the other. Taken together, this suggests a fundamental difference in susceptibility between the genetically divergent host lineages. Using weight relative to body length as a measure of body condition, we found no differential impact of parasitism on the body condition of each host lineage, and no evidence that parasitism impacts the body condition of the host in general.

**Evolution of pre-zygotic and post-zygotic barriers to gene flow among three cryptic species within the Anastrepha fraterculus complex**

Rull, J; Abraham, S; Kovaleski, A; Segura, DF; Mendoza, M; Liendo, MC; Vera, MT. 2013

Tropical tephritids are ideally suited for studies on population divergence and speciation because they include species groups undergoing rapid radiation, in which morphologically cryptic species and sister species are abundant. The fraterculus species group in the Neotropical genus Anastrepha is a case in point, as it is composed of a complex of up to seven A.fraterculus morphotypes proposed to be cryptic species. Here, we document pre- and post-zygotic barriers to gene flow among adults of the Mexican A.fraterculus morphotype and three populations (Argentina, Brazil, and Peru) belonging to two separate morphotypes (Brazilian 1 and Peruvian). We unveiled three forms of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation resulting in strong assortative mating. In field cages, free-ranging male and female A.fraterculus displayed a strong tendency to form couples with members of the opposite sex belonging to their own morphotype, suggesting that male pheromone emission, courtship displays, or both intervene in shaping female choice before actual contact and coupling. In addition, males and females of the Peruvian morphotype became receptive and mated significantly later than adults of the Mexican and Brazilian 1 morphotypes. After contact, Mexican females exhibited greater mating discrimination than males when facing adults of the opposite sex belonging to either the Peruvian or the Brazilian 1 morphotype as evidenced by vigorous resistance to penetration once they had been forcefully mounted by heterotypic males. Forced copulations resulted in production of F1 **hybrid**s that were either less viable (and partially fertile) than parental crosses or even sterile. Our results suggest that the Mexican morphotype is a distinct biological entity and that pre-zygotic reproductive isolation through divergence in courtship or male-produced pheromone and other mechanisms appear to evolve faster than post-zygotic isolation in the fraterculus species group.

**The clock gene cryptochrome of Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) in strains with different mating times**

Fuchikawa, T; Sanada, S; Nishio, R; Matsumoto, A; Matsuyama, T; Yamagishi, M; Tomioka, K; Tanimura, T; Miyatake, T. 2010

Differences in mating time between populations can give rise to premating reproductive isolation. Tephritid fruit flies exhibit large variation in mating time among intra-or inter-specific populations. We previously cloned the clock gene period from two strains of melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae; in one the individuals mate early during the day, whereas in the other the individuals mate later. These strains were originally established by divergent artificial selection for developmental time, 'short' and 'long', with early and late mating times, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of PERIOD proteins for these two strains were reported to be identical. Here we cloned another clock gene cryptochrome (cry) from the two strains, and found two stable amino acid substitutions in the strains. In addition, the allele frequency at the two polymorphic sites of cry gene correlated with the circadian locomotor period (tau) across strains, whereas the expression pattern of cry mRNA in the heads of flies taken from the short strain significantly differed from that from the long strain. These findings suggest that variation in the cry gene is related to differences in the circadian behaviour in the two strains, thus implying that the cry gene may have an important role in reproductive isolation.

**SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF HOVERING MALE TABANUS-NIGROVITTATUS (DIPTERA, TABANIDAE)**

MCMAHON, MJ; GAUGLER, R. 1993

Male Tabanus nigrovittatus Macquart hover as a premating strategy in the early morning over Atlantic coastal salt marshes. These males are distributed with peak densities near mosquito ditches and with fewer hovering males farther from the ditch. Multivariate analysis indicated that male density or the distance between individuals is an important factor in structuring hovering male spatial distribution. When compared with previously published data, male densities match peak emergence of females. T. nigrovittatus numbers are lowest directly adjacent to mosquito ditches, where Tabanus conterminus (Walker) tends to hover, suggesting that spatial separation may contribute to reproductive isolation in these two sibling species.

**INCIPIENT SEXUAL ISOLATION IN DROSOPHILA-PSEUDOOBSCURA BOGOTANA AYALA AND DOBZHANSKY (DIPTERA, DROSOPHILIDAE)**

NOOR, MA. 1995

Incipient sexual isolation was found between the subspecies Drosophila pseudoobscura bogotana (Ayala and Dobzhansky) and D. p, pseudoobscura (Frolova). Males took longer to initiate courtship with heterosubspecifics than consubspecifics. This divergence could represent an early step in the speciation of these taxa. The subspecies' pheromones do not appear to have diverged, so the difference is attributed to female behavior.

**Acoustic signals in the sand fly Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) intermedia (Diptera: Psychodidae)**

Vigoder, FM; Souza, NA; Peixoto, AA. 2011

Background: Acoustic signals are part of the courtship of many insects and they often act as species-specific signals that are important in the reproductive isolation of closely related species. Here we report the courtship songs of the sand fly Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) intermedia, one of the main vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil. Findings: Recordings were performed using insects from three localities from Eastern Brazil: Posse and Jacarepagua in Rio de Janeiro State and Corte de Pedra in Bahia State. The three areas have remnants of the Brazilian Atlantic forest, they are endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis and L. intermedia is the predominant sand fly species. We observed that during courtship L. intermedia males from all populations produced pulse songs consisting of short trains. No significant differences in song parameters were observed between the males of the three localities. Conclusions: L. intermedia males produce acoustic signals as reported for some other sand flies such as the sibling species of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex. The lack of differences between the males from the three localities is consistent with previous molecular studies of the period gene carried out in the same populations, reinforcing the idea that L. intermedia is not a species complex in the studied areas and that the three populations are likely to have similar vectorial capacities.

**Allozyme differentiation among allopatric populations of Anopheles nuneztovari (Diptera: Culicidae)**

Scarpassa, VM; Tadei, WP; Suarez, MF. 1996

Four enzymes in six geographic populations, four Brazilian and two Colombian, of Anopheles nuneztovari were studied. There were differences among the most frequent alleles in the EST5, ACON and MDH loci in the populations from Brazil and Colombia. The alpha-GPD*C allele was encountered very frequently in the Palo/Sit population in Colombia and the alpha-GPD*B allele was found to be fixed in most of the Brazilian populations. An additional alpha-GPD band was found only in Palo/Sit. The considerable genetic differentiation between populations in western Colombia vs. Brazil suggests that a certain degree of reproductive isolation exists between them.

**Shared microsatellite loci in Glossina morsitans sensu lato (Diptera : Glossinidae)**

Krafsur, ES; Endsley, MA. 2006

Estimation of allelic frequencies at three microsatellite loci among 20 populations of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood, Glossina morsitans submorsitans Newstead, and Glossina morsitans centralis Machado indicated only two of 99 alleles were shared between three subspecies and 18 between any two subspecies; 81 alleles were unshared. The conserved flanking regions of each locus were completely shared. Genetic differentiation among subspecies, based on allele size, was R-ST = 0.87, close to the theoretic maximum value. All evidence suggests longstanding and complete reproductive isolation in nature among the sibling species. They should be elevated to specific rank.

**The Gall Midge Asphondylia borrichiae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae): An Indigenous Example of Host-Associated Genetic Divergence in Sympatry**

Stokes, K; Stiling, P; Gilg, MR; Rossi, AM. 2012

Speciation usually is conceptualized as occurring via three biogeographic modes: allopatry, parapatry, and sympatry. Sympatric speciation has been the most controversial because of the difficulty of developing plausible theoretical models in which the homogenizing effects of gene flow are sufficiently overcome to permit genetic divergence to occur in the absence of geographic barriers restricting gene flow. Recently, a number of hypothetical models for sympatric speciation have been advanced and several candidate study systems have provided evidence of sympatric divergence, although many of the systems so identified involve introduced species, especially in the cases of host-race formation in phytophagous insects, which expand their host range and use a novel host. Although these cases demonstrate the reality of sympatric divergence, they do not address which mode of speciation predominates in indigenous communities. Asphondylia borrichiae Rossi & Strong has been proposed as a potential example of sympatric divergence in a fully indigenous system, based on the results of a host-choice experiment involving three host-plant species. In the current study, we report significant differences in the genetic composition of midge populations collected from each host in situ, supporting the hypothesis of sympatric genetic divergence among the morphologically identical host-associated populations of A. borrichiae and consistent with host fidelity in oviposition choice.

**Geographic and Ecological Dimensions of Host Plant-Associated Genetic Differentiation and Speciation in the Rhagoletis cingulata (Diptera: Tephritidae) Sibling Species Group**

Doellman, MM; Schuler, H; Saint, GJ; Hood, GR; Egan, SP; Powell, THQ; Glover, MM; Bruzzese, DJ; Smith, JJ; Yee, WL; Goughnour, RB; Rull, J; Aluja, M; Feder, JL. 2019

Ascertaining the causes of adaptive radiation is central to understanding how new species arise and come to vary with their resources. The ecological theory posits adaptive radiation via divergent natural selection associated with novel resource use; an alternative suggests character displacement following speciation in allopatry and then secondary contact of reproductively isolated but ecologically similar species. Discriminating between hypotheses, therefore, requires the establishment of a key role for ecological diversification in initiating speciation versus a secondary role in facilitating co-existence. Here, we characterize patterns of genetic variation and postzygotic reproductive isolation for tephritid fruit flies in the Rhagoletis cingulata sibling species group to assess the significance of ecology, geography, and non-adaptive processes for their divergence. Our results support the ecological theory: no evidence for intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation was found between two populations of allopatric species, while nuclear-encoded microsatellites implied strong ecologically based reproductive isolation among sympatric species infesting different host plants. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggested, however, that cytoplasmic-related reproductive isolation may also exist between two geographically isolated populations within R cingulata. Thus, ecology associated with sympatric host shifts and cytoplasmic effects possibly associated with an endosymbiont may be the key initial drivers of the radiation of the R. cingulata group.

**Experimental hybridization among Anastrepha species (Diptera : Tephritidae): Production and morphological characterization of F-1 hybrids**

dos Santos, P; Uramoto, K; Matioli, SR. 2001

We report experimental interspecific **hybrid**ization between Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), A. sororcula Zucchi, and A. obliqua (Macquart),widespread and highly destructible crop pests in the Neotropical region. Prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms (such as different mating times and male calling songs) seem to be easily disrupted in no-choice crossing conditions. and **hybrid** flies can be obtained in both directions in most crosses. Crosses between A. sororcula females and A. fraterculus males and between A. obliqua females and A. sororcula males yield adult offspring of males and females. Crosses between A. fraterculus or A. sororcula females and A. obliqua males yield only females clearly obeying Haldane's rule (preferential inviability or sterility of heterogametic **hybrid**s). Crosses between A. obliqua females and A. fraterculus males and between A. fraterculus females and A. sororcula males yield poor or no adult offspring of both sexes, with a fe exceptions. Most F-1 **hybrid**s are fertile and can be backcrossed to both parental species. The few morphological diagnostic characters of the parental forms appear intermediate in F-1 **hybrid**s. In addition, we describe some morphological abnormalities found in **hybrid**s,attributed to maternal or cytoplasmic effects, and the occurrence of gynandromorphs in the progeny of one cross.

**Incipient reproductive isolation between two morphs of Drosophila elegans (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Hirai, Y; Kimura, MT. 1997

Drosophila elegans is a flower-breeding species occurring in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Two morphs, brown and black, are known in this species. The brown morph is recorded from southern China, Philippines, Indonesia and New Guinea, while the black morph is from the Okinawa islands and Taiwan. The present crossing experiment suggests that the difference of body colour between them wats due to alleles on a single locus or closely linked loci on an autosome; F-1 **hybrid**s exhibited intermediate body colour. Female choice tests revealed asymmetrical premating isolation between the brown and black morphs; isolation indices ranged from 0.55 to 0.83 in the tests using females of the black morph (deviation from random mating was significant), but from -0.03 to 0.50 in the tests using females of the brown morph (deviation from random mating was insignificant). However, body colour was not used as a criterion of mate choice by females. A weak and asymmetrical postmating isolation was also observed between the brown and black morphs; viability was lowered in F-2 progenies of crosses between females of the brown morph and males of the black morph. No premating or postmating isolation was observed between geographic strains of each morph. Under irradiation, body temperature was higher in the black morph than in the brown morph. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in tolerance to cold, heat and desiccation between the brown and black morphs. (C) 1997 The Linnean Society of London.

**Cytogenetics of the Holarctic black fly Simulium noelleri (Diptera : Simuliidae)**

Adler, PH; Kachvorian, EA. 2001

The polytene chromosomes of Simulium noelleri from 16 sites in Armenia, Canada, England, Germany, Russia, and Sweden were analyzed. A standard map is proposed for the S. noelleri species-group that is 11 fixed inversions removed from the original standard map of the subgenus Simulium. Based on one shared subterminal inversion in the IIIL arm, the S. noelleri species-group is in a trichotomy with the S. bezzi and S. ornatum species-groups. Reproductive isolation of S. noelleri and S. decorum is demonstrated chromosomally at sites where both occur together. All analyzed populations of S. noelleri are considered conservatively to represent a single species, although at least three cytotypes are recognized, based primarily on different sex-chromosome systems. Cytotype A, representing the type species of S. noelleri, occurs in Germany, England, and western Russia. Cytotype B occupies Sweden and western Canada, emphasizing the intimate connection between the northern Nearctic and Palearctic simuliid faunas. Cytotype C is known only from Armenia.

**Cytotaxonomy of the Prosimulium (Diptera: Simuliidae) of Western Asia**

Adler, PH; Sirin, U. 2014

Chromosomal analysis of more than 500 larval black flies from 19 sites in Armenia and Turkey revealed five taxa in the Prosimulium hirtipes group: Prosimulium frontatum Terteryan, Prosimulium rachiliense Djafarov cytoform 'A,' P. rachiliense Djafarov cytoform 'B,' Prosimulium tomosvaryi (Enderlein), and a new species of Prosimulium. To associate the names rufipes (Meigen) and tomosvaryi with cytological entities, larvae from the respective type localities in Germany were characterized chromosomally. Prosimulium frontatum is restricted to the Caucasus Mountains where studied populations have five unique inversions. It is most closely related to cytoforms 'A' and 'B' of P. rachiliense, the three taxa sharing one unique inversion. The two cytoforms of P. rachiliense are separated by about 1200 km, obscuring decisions about their reproductive isolation. The names rachiliense and possibly pronevitschae Rubtsov apply to cytoform 'A' in Armenia, whereas the name fulvipes (Edwards) might apply to cytoform 'B' in Turkey and to material formerly identified in Turkey as P. rufipes. Populations of P. tomosvaryi in Armenia are chromosomally distinct from previously studied populations in Europe and Morocco, although tied to European and Turkish populations by a shared X-linked inversion. We conservatively view Armenian, European, and Turkish populations of P. tomosvaryi as a single, polymorphic species. A new species, chromosomally related to P. hirtipes (Fries) and P. tomosvaryi by two uniquely shared inversions, was discovered in Turkey. (C) 2014 The Linnean Society of London

**Genetic variation in isolated populations of Drosophila mercatorum (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in semi-arid ecosystems**

Estrada, AP; Prieto, R. 2011

Variations in external and internal genitalia could constitute into pre-zygote barriers that prevent mating, contributing to the divergence between populations of species and allowing the emergence of new species. Sexual characteristics like mating, were taken into account to study the evolutionary processes involved in the morphology differentiation of the genitalia, for this purpose, there were conducted interpopulation crossings and morphometric analysis of external and internal genitalia of two populations of Drosophila mercatorum and its respective **hybrid**s, collected in the Tatacoa Desert (Huila) and the Patia valley (Narino), considering that these are important taxonomic, characters, even to the level of subspecies and races. Morphometric analysis of non-sexual related characteristic such as' wings and abdominal stains were performed to compare the variability between populations, as well as to obtain their correlations, by using 28 individuals per population for geometric morphometrics and 20 for the traditional one, as in the case of the aedeagus. Less variability in these structures and a positive con-elation for the wing size and the aedeagus were found. The number of sows in the clasp, the shape of the wing and abdominal stains did not show significant differences between populations; however, the decrease in the offspring produced through the inter-population crossings and back-crossings, and the morphological variation in the aedeagus, allow differentiating them as geographic races.

**BEHAVIORAL REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IN DROSOPHILA-SILVESTRIS, D-HETERONEURA, AND THEIR F1 HYBRIDS (DIPTERA, DROSOPHILIDAE)**

PRICE, DK; BOAKE, CRB. 1995

We investigated the role that courtship and aggressive interactions may have for the maintenance of reproductive isolation between Drosophila silvestris and D. heteroneura. We examined the behavioral bases of reproductive isolation between the parental species and we examined the courtship success of each sex of both reciprocal F-1 **hybrid**s when paired with the parental species. We found reduced copulation success among heterotypic parental pairs compared to homotypic pairs, which was primarily due to the lack of courtship initiation between D. silvestris males and D. heteroneura females. When **hybrid** males from both reciprocal crosses were paired with parental females their copulation successes were not significantly different from that of parental males. In contrast, **hybrid** females from both crosses had reduced copulation success with D. silvestris males, which in turn was primarily due to a reduced success of reaching later stages of courtship. The time spent in copulation by **hybrid** males was intermediate between the two parental males. We studied aggression by observing the interactions of males of heterotypic pairs, both between the parental species and between the **hybrid**s and parental males. A lack of aggressive interactions between D, silvestris males and D. heteroneura males in addition to the lack of courtship suggests that D. silvestris males do not respond to D. heteroneura individuals of either sex. **Hybrid** males were equally successful in winning fights with both D. silvestris and D. heteroneura males. These results indicate that the behavioral isolation between D. silvestris and D. heteroneura may be largely a consequence of the earliest stages of interactions. The two species may differ either in activity levels or in morphological or chemical traits that are important for species and mate recognition. The relatively high copulation and aggressive success of **hybrid**s indicates that sexual selection against **hybrid**s alone is unlikely to be a sufficient force to reduce gene flow and maintain species distinctions.

**Adult emergence and reproductive behavior of the leafcurling midge Dasineura mali (Diptera : Cecidomyiidae)**

Harris, MO; Galanihe, LD; Sandanayake, M. 1999

The leafcurling midges Dascineura mali Kieffer collected as mature larvae in curled apple leaves were brought to the laboratory where they left leaves and pupated in Lores of soil. Two to 3 uk later, adult eclosion showed a diel periodicity, peak eclosion occurring between 0600 and 1000 hours. Within this period, peak male eclosion typically occurred 1-2.5 h earlier than peak female eclosion. For males, wing fanning, mating, and flight first occurred, on average, 30, 32, and 41 min after eclosion, respectively. For virgin females, calling behavior and mating first occurred, on average, 16 and 38 min after eclosion, respectively. Calling events were of variable duration (0.3-55 min) and occurred most frequently between 0900 and 1500 hours. Males mated many times, whereas females mated only once or twice, After mating, females sat for approximate to 1 h before taking their Ist flight. In a windtunnel, percentages of females taking-off flying upwind, and exhibiting examining behaviors on apple leaves increased from the morning to the afternoon. In an apple orchard, traps placed below the canopy of trees caught more males than traps placed in the tree canopy. The relevance of this information for the isolation and identification of behaviorally active chemicals (i.e., pheromones and kairomones) is discussed.

**Evidence for sexual isolation as a prezygotic barrier to gene flow between morphologically divergent species of Rhagoletis fruit flies**

Hood, GR; Egan, SP; Feder, JL. 2012

1. Certain groups of fruit flies in the genus Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) are exemplars for sympatric speciation via host plant shifting. Flies in these species groups are morphologically similar and overlap in their geographic ranges, yet attack different, non-overlapping sets of host plants. Ecological adaptations related to differences in host choice and preference have been shown to be important prezygotic barriers to gene flow between these taxa, as Rhagoletis flies mate on or near the fruit of their respective host plants. Non-host-related assortative mating is generally absent or present at low levels between these sympatrically diverging fly populations. 2. However, some Rhagoletis taxa occasionally migrate to non-natal plants that are the primary hosts of other, morphologically differentiated fly species in the genus. These observations raise the question of whether sexual isolation may reduce courtship and copulation between morphologically divergent species of Rhagoletis flies, contributing to their prezygotic isolation along with host-specific mating. 3. Using reciprocal multiple-choice mating trials, we measured sexual isolation among nine species pairs of morphologically differentiated Rhagoletis flies. Complete sexual isolation was observed in eight of the nine comparisons, while partial sexual isolation was observed in the remaining comparison. 4. We conclude that sexual isolation can be an effective prezygotic barrier to gene flow contributing to substantial reproductive isolation between many morphologically distinct Rhagoletis species, even in the absence of differential host plant choice and host-associated mating.

**Population cytogenetic evidence for sibling species in Anopheles annularis (Diptera : Culicidae)**

Atrie, B; Subbarao, SK; Pillai, MKK; Rao, SRV; Sharma, VP. 1999

Anopheles annularis van der Wulp populations from 6 districts in India were cytologically examined. An ovarian nurse cell polytene chromosome map for 5 arms is presented. Nine inversions-w,i(1),j(1), and k(1) on chromosome arm 2; j(1) and z in arm 3; h(1) and s(1) on arm 4; and k on arm 5-were polymorphic in these populations. In districts Shahjahanpur and Ghaziabad populations, for j(1) inversion on arm 2, there were no heterozygotes. This was taken as evidence for reproductive isolation between 2 populations. The 2 were provisionally designated as species A and B, characterized respectively by +j(1) and j(1) arrangements in chromosome arm 2. The other 4 populations were identified as species A.

**Cuticular hydrocarbon variation among Rhagoletis fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae): implications for premating reproductive isolation and ecological speciation**

Hood, GR; Jennings, JH; Bruzzese, DJ; Beehler, M; Schmitt, T; Feder, JL; Etges, WJ. 2022

1. Fruit flies in the genus Rhagoletis are a model for ecological speciation via sympatric host plant shifting. Rhagoletis mate on or near the fruit of their respective host plants, generating premating reproductive isolation between taxa specialised on different hosts. However, non-host-related premating isolation has been observed between some Rhagoletis species associated with morphological differences in body colour and wing patterns. 2. Here, the extent of epicuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) variation as a possible, additional determinant of mate choice in adults of six Rhagoletis taxa, including the apple and hawthorn-infesting host races of R. pomonella is investigated. 3. Gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry revealed 36 repeatable and quantifiable hydrocarbon components present on the epicuticles of all six fly taxa, comprised of at least 53 different CHC compounds, with chain lengths varying from 27 to 34 carbon atoms, consisting of n-alkanes, mono-, dimethyl-, and trimethyl-alkanes, alkenes, and alkadienes. There were significant differences in the relative proportions of CHCs between adult R. cingulata, R. cornivora, R. zephyria, R. mendax, and R. pomonella, as well as between the apple- and hawthorn-infesting host races of R. pomonella. Furthermore, within the R. pomonella host races and R. mendax, significant CHC differences were observed between the sexes and across collecting sites. 4. The results are consistent with variation in CHCs potentially contributing to observed patterns of premating isolation between Rhagoletis taxa, possibly due to combination of sexual and host-related selection, which will necessitate further, in depth chemical analyses and future mating trials to substantiate.

**Effects of laboratory colonization on Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera, Tephritidae) mating behaviour: 'what a difference a year makes'**

Schutze, MK; Dammalage, T; Jessup, A; Vreysen, MJB; Wornoayporn, V; Clarke, AR. NA

Laboratory-reared insects are widely known to have significantly reduced genetic diversity in comparison to wild populations; however, subtle behavioural changes between laboratory-adapted and wild or 'wildish' (i.e., within one or very few generations of field collected material) populations are less well understood. Quantifying alterations in behaviour, particularly sexual, in laboratory-adapted insects is important for mass-reared insects for use in pest management strategies, especially those that have a sterile insect technique component. We report subtle changes in sexual behaviour between 'wildish' Bactrocera dorsalis flies (F1 and F2) from central and southern Thailand and the same colonies 12 months later when at six generations from wild. Mating compatibility tests were undertaken under standardised semi-natural conditions, with number of homo/heterotypic couples and mating location in field cages analysed via compatibility indices. Central and southern populations of B. dorsalis displayed positive assortative mating in the 2010 trials but mated randomly in the 2011 trials. 'Wildish' southern Thailand males mated significantly earlier than central Thailand males in 2010; this difference was considerably reduced in 2011, yet homotypic couples from southern Thailand still formed significantly earlier than all other couple combinations. There was no significant difference in couple location in 2010; however, couple location significantly differed among pair types in 2011 with those involving southern Thailand females occurring significantly more often on the tree relative to those with central Thailand females. Relative participation also changed with time, with more southern Thailand females forming couples relative to central Thailand females in 2010; this difference was considerably decreased by 2011. These results reveal how subtle changes in sexual behaviour, as driven by laboratory rearing conditions, may significantly influence mating behaviour between laboratory-adapted and recently colonised tephritid fruit flies over a relatively short period of time.

**Sympatry and Asymmetric Introgression Between the Cactophilic Species Drosophila serido and Drosophila antonietae (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Kokudai, CBS; Sene, FM; Manfrin, MH. 2011

The cactophilic species Drosophila serido Vilela and Sene 1977 and Drosophila antonietae Tidon-Sklorz and Sene 2001 are two closely related species that have partially overlapping distributions in the Florianopolis-SC locality on the southern Brazilian coast. To characterize this contact zone with respect to possible introgression events and the differential use of cacti hosts, we analyzed male individuals that were collected in their natural environment or from the necrotic cacti in which they were reared, by using aedeagus morphology, isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes, and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I as diagnostic markers. Morphological and molecular markers showed a bimodal distribution, although there was some incongruence, suggesting the presence of asymmetric introgression events. These results suggest that gene flow occurred in the past but then ceased, possibly due to reinforcement of prezygotic reproductive isolation. Analysis of individuals reared in necrotic cacti of two sympatric species in this region showed that D. antonietae, but not D. serido, preferentially uses Cereus hildmannianus Mill. as a cactus host, which may represent an important influence on ecological differentiation by affecting the dynamics of these species in this area of sympatry.

**Evolution of phenologically distinct populations of Rhagoletis mendax (Diptera : Tephritidae) in highbush blueberry fields**

Teixeira, LAF; Polavarapu, S. 2003

Populations of Rhagoletis mendax with novel late flight period, in August-September, have been found in two commercial highbush blueberry fields in New Jersey, thriving in fruit left behind after the harvest of a late blueberry cultivar. A small number of flies with similar late flight period have also been captured in several locations where blueberry maggot infests wild hosts. Using allozyme markers, we found that allele frequencies in wild blueberry maggot populations are constant from June to September, and distinct from those found in populations infesting the two commercial fields. The populations in the commercial fields present a pattern of decreased genetic diversity, including lower heterozygosity and distortions in allele frequency distribution. These data suggest that a founder effect, the loss of genetic diversity caused by the establishment of a small sample of individuals as a newly isolated entity, is responsible for the genetic differences between the populations in the commercial fields and in wild areas. The founder effect most likely occurred because only a small proportion of the flies present in wild areas possesses the late phenology required for the colonization of the commercial fields. The seasonal asynchrony between the populations in commercial fields and those in wild areas may also have contributed to maintain the founder effect by limiting gene flow. This study suggests that early in a phenological transition, if the onset of prezygotic reproductive isolation is relatively fast, evolution at the genetic level might be caused mostly by genetic drift. This study further confirms that the flight period is plastic in the blueberry maggot.

**Courtship in Two Morphotypes of the Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) Cryptic Species Complex and their Implications for Understanding Mate Recognition**

Roriz, AKP; Japyassu, HF; Joachim-Bravo, IS. 2018

Ritualized courtship behaviors are used to recognize potential mates and behavioral patterns are inevitably different among populations that demonstrate reproductive incompatibility. We characterized and compared the courtship behaviors of two morphotypes of the cryptic species complex Anastrepha fraterculus: Brazil-1 morphotype and Brazil-3 morphotype. Courtship behaviors were filmed to analyze the behavioral sequences of these two morphotypes during homotypic crossings. The behavioral units Alignment (AL) and Abdominal movements (AB and AB-call) were newly recognized in the courtship ethogram of Anastrepha fraterculus males. The two morphotypes show distinct behavioral sequences leading up to copulation. Some behaviors were repeated frequently during the courtship process, while others were more restricted to the final moments of courtship. The three behavioral units that contributed most to copulation success were Contact, Alignment, and Arrowhead 1 in the Brazil-1 morphotype and Alignment, Arrowhead 1, and Fanning in the Brazil-3 morphotype. Some behavioral routines differed across the two morphotypes. Significant differences were also noted between the frequencies of the behavioral units displayed during courtship in the two morphotypes. The relationships between the pre-zygotic incompatibilities of the Brazil-1 and Brazil-3 morphotypes and the differences between the courtship behaviors of their males are discussed. Our results indicate that behavioral isolation is involved in the process of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation of Brazil-1 and Brazil-3 morphotypes.

**High-Elevation Chromosomal Diversity of Black Flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) in Thailand**

Adler, PH; Srisuka, W; Van Lun, LL; Takaoka, H; Saeung, A. 2019

The highest elevations of tropical mountains, much like oceanic islands, often support disproportionately high levels of endemism, some of which is concealed as cryptic species. In a search for additional species, we explored the chromosomal diversity of three morphologically defined species of black flies known only from the upper elevations of Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest mountain. Analysis of the polytene chromosomes facilitated the discovery of the previously unknown larva of Simulium kiewmaepanense Takaoka & Srisuka, permitted linkage of the formal name of S. undecimum Takaoka, Srisuka & Saeung with its previous cytological identity, and revealed cryptic species, designated A and B, within S. tenebrosum Takaoka, Srisuka & Atiporn. A probable new species of microsporidium was discovered in the larval fat body of S. kiewmaepanense, suggesting that at least some symbiotic organisms of endemic hosts are also restricted to Doi Inthanon. A mitochondrial DNA analysis did not distinguish the two cryptic species of S. tenebrosum despite complete reproductive isolation chromosomally inferred from an absence of **hybrid**s, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to species problems.The chromosomes of all four analyzed species were monomorphic, or nearly so, perhaps reflecting the suppression of polymorphic inversions that otherwise would restrict recombination needed to generate adequate variation in the peripheral environment of the mountain summit.

**Flight tone of field-collected populations of Anopheles gambiae and An-arabiensis (Diptera : Culicidae)**

Wekesa, JW; Brogdon, WG; Hawley, WA; Besansky, NJ. 1998

Laboratory colonies of the human malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae Giles and An. arabiensis Patton have distinct flight tones. If flight tone similarly distinguishes natural populations of these sympatric sibling species, it may play a role in reproductive isolation of swarms that are otherwise behaviourally identical. To assess the fidelity of flight tone differences in natural populations, flight tone was measured in the Fl progeny of mosquitoes of both species captured in western Kenya. Flight tone distributions of wild An. gambiae and An. arabiensis were similar to their laboratory conspecifics. However, interspecies comparisons of flight tone of wild mosquitoes revealed significantly different but overlapping distributions for both sexes. Furthermore, when the effect of body size on flight tone was determined, there was a positive correlation between wing length and flight tone for both sexes of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, suggesting that mosquito size is a significant variable affecting flight tone. Although these findings diminish any practical benefit of flight tone as a diagnostic tool in species identification, its potential role in pre-mating species recognition needs further investigation.

**Specificity of accessory gland extracts in three Delia fly species (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)**

Spencer, JL; Candolfi, MP; Keller, JE; Miller, JR. 1997

Extracts of testes and male accessory (paragonial) glands made from three species of Delia (onion fly (D.antiqua), seedcorn fly (D.platura), and cabbage fly (D.radicum)) were injected into conspecific virgin females. Extracts of paragonial glands, but not testes, from onion, seedcorn and cabbage fly males stimulated oviposition and suppressed mating when injected into conspecific virgin females. When extracts of paragonial glands from males of these species were injected into heterospecific virgin females, the extracts of D.antiqua and D.platura were fully cross-reactive with respect to oviposition; interspecific injection stimulated oviposition at the level of the conspecific mated controls. Injection of D.radicum extract fully activated the D.antiqua and D.platura ovipositional response. D.antiqua extract caused mating inhibition and partial oviposition in D.radicum; that of D.platura had no effect on either oviposition or mating inhibition in D.radicum. These results suggest that D.antiqua and D.platura are more closely related to one another than either is to D.radicum, and agree with published anatomically-based phylogenies and a genetic distance calculation based on eight enzyme loci. The occurrence of sex peptide cross-reactivity, though asymmetrical, between D.radicum versus D.antiqua and D.platura indicates that, functionally, sex peptides have changed little during the evolution of this genus. An emerging pattern of broad cross-reactivity within genera suggests that sex peptides are not an initiator of reproductive isolation.

**Potential for mating between Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) and Bactrocera neohumeralis (Hardy) (Diptera : Tephritidae)**

Pike, N; Meats, A. 2002

We conducted a series of mating experiments in the laboratory and in a glasshouse to examine male calling and the potential for mating between Bactrocera tryoni and B. neohumeralis. Males of each species do make presumed courtship calls, but at entirely discrete periods and regardless of the presence of other males or females. Despite this, assortative mating tests in the glasshouse demonstrated the potential for rare interspecific matings. When F, **hybrid**s were included in these assortative mating tests they commonly mated with B. neohumeralis during the middle of the day and with B. tryoni at dusk. **Hybrid**s may facilitate bidirectional gene flow between these species.

**Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci from the apple maggot fly Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera : Tephritidae)**

Velez, S; Taylor, MS; Noor, MAF; Lobo, NF; Feder, JL. 2006

We report the isolation and development of 81 novel primers for amplifying microsatellite loci in the Rhagoletis pomonella sibling species complex, and the sequencing, characterization and analysis of basic population genetic parameters for nine of these genes. We also report the successful cross-species amplification of several of these loci. The R. pomonella sibling species complex is a textbook example of genetic differentiation in sympatry via host-plant shifting. Microsatellite markers can be useful for mapping host-plant-associated adaptations in Rhagoletis that generate reproductive isolation and facilitate speciation, as well as for resolving the genetic structure and evolutionary history of fly populations.

**Molecular identification of two Culex (Culex) species of the neotropical region (Diptera: Culicidae)**

Laurito, M; Ayala, AM; Almiron, WR; Gardenal, CN. 2017

Culex bidens and C. interfor, implicated in arbovirus transmission in Argentina, are sister species, only distinguishable by feature of the male genitalia; however, intermediate specimens of the species in sympatry have been found. Fourth-instar larvae and females of both species share apomorphic features, and this lack of clear distinction creates problems for specific identification. Geometric morphometric traits of these life stages also do not distinguish the species. The aim of the present study was to assess the taxonomic status of C. bidens and C. interfor using two mitochondrial genes and to determine the degree of their reproductive isolation using microsatellite loci. Sequences of the ND4 and COI genes were concatenated in a matrix of 993 nucleotides and used for phylogenetic and distance analyses. Bayesian and maximum parsimony inferences showed a well resolved and supported topology, enclosing sequences of individuals of C. bidens (0.83 BPP, 73 BSV) and C. interfor (0.98 BPP, 97 BSV) in a strong sister relationship. The mean K2P distance within C. bidens and C. interfor was 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, and the interspecific variation was 2.3%. Bayesian clustering also showed two distinct mitochondrial lineages. All sequenced mosquitoes were successfully identified in accordance with the best close match algorithm. The low genetic distance values obtained indicate that the species diverged quite recently. Most morphologically intermediate specimens of C. bidens from Co A rdoba were heterozygous for the microsatellite locus GT51; the significant heterozygote excess observed suggests incomplete reproductive isolation. However, C. bidens and C. interfor should be considered good species: the ventral arm of the phallosome of the male genitalia and the ND4 and COI sequences are diagnostic characters.

**Black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) of east-central Saskatchewan, with description of a new species and implications for pest management**

Adler, PH; Mason, PG. 1997

A 5-year study of the black flies of east-central Saskatchewan revealed 21 species, including Simulium incognitum sp.nov. Chromosomal and ecological evidence for reproductive isolation is presented for this new species, formerly known as S. venustum Say CC4, and S. venustum Say CC. All 21 species in the study are associated with productive streams and rivers, As many as nine of these species might comprise the pest assemblage harassing livestock. The major pest, S. luggeri Nicholson and Mickel, is cytologically distinct from populations in the eastern United States on the basis of a two-step, Y-linked inversion in the IIS chromosomal arm. Simulium luggeri is the only livestock pest that breeds almost solely in large streams and rivers. The other eight probable pests breed entirely or partly in streams less than 10 m wide, often below beaver dams, suggesting that management efforts should specifically target these sites.

**Morphological comparison among Drosophila lini and its two new sibling species (Diptera : Drosophilidae)**

Zannat, MT; Toda, MJ. 2002

Morphological differences are investigated using several culture strains of three sibling species collected from Taiwan and Guangdong in China and Pyinoolwin and Yangon in Myanmar. Careful examination of male terminalia reveals distinguishable differences in the paramere and the aedeagal basal process among the three species. In addition, a number of quantitative characters are compared. Kruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni correction, which are carried out separately for each sex, detect significant differences in 15 characters, of which two are male-specific, among the three species. Canonical discriminant analysis using these characters reveals that the three species can be distinguished from each other with high confidence for both sexes. The results clearly show the presence of three good species, Drosophila (Sophophora) lini Bock & Wheeler, 1972 and its two new siblings. The new species are described as Drosophila (Sophophora) ohnishii sp. nov. from Pyinoolwin and Drosophila (Sophophora) ogumai sp. nov. from Yangon. The morphological differentiation among the three sibling species does not coincide with the degree of reproductive isolation (based on a previous study). The premating isolation pattern suggests two possibilities that premating isolation has been evolved or reinforced in sympatric populations between D. ohnishii and D. fini and between D. ohnishii and D. ogumai or that it has evolved in a very restricted local population of D. ohnishii, possibly by a few mutations.

**Phylogeographic patterns of host-race evolution in Tephritis conura (Diptera : Tephritidae)**

Diegisser, T; Seitz, A; Johannesen, J. 2006

Host-race evolution is a prime candidate for sympatric speciation because host shifts must take place in the presence of both hosts. However, the geographic context in which the shift takes place may have strong allopatric or peripatric components if the primary host within a localized area is scarce or even goes extinct. Inference of the relative importance of the geographic mode of speciation may be gained from phylogeographic imprints. Here, we investigate the phylogeography of host races of the tephritid fly Tephritis conura from sympatric, parapatric and allopatric populations of Cirsium heterophyllum and Cirsium oleraceum (Asteraceae) in Europe, for addressing the age and direction, and the geographic context of host-race formation. Haplotype networks of the host races differed significantly in molecular diversity and topology. However, host-race haplotypes were nested within the same network, with a central haplotype H1 being the most common haplotype in both host races. C. heterophyllum flies were genetically more diverse and substructured than flies from C. oleracemn, suggesting that the latter is the derived race. The phylogeographic imprint indicates either that C. heterophyllum flies colonized C. oleracemn during range expansion or that heterophyllum flies went extinct in an area where oleraceum flies persisted (followed by re-immigration). These imprints are in concordance with peripatric diversification, probably in the European Alps and related to the last ice age, where the host-race diversification was largely completed before the postglacial range expansion on C. oleracemn to current areas of sympatry and parapatry with C. heterophyllum.

**Recursive adaptation in action: allochronic isolation and divergence of host-associated populations of the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, following its recent introduction to the western USA**

Mattsson, M; Hood, GR; Yee, WL; Doellman, MM; Bruzzese, DJ; Goughnour, RB; Driscoe, AL; Van Dexter, S; Tait, C; Glover, MM; Meyers, P; Ruedas, LA; Feder, JL. 2022

An outstanding issue in the study of insect host races concerns the idea of 'recursive adaptive divergence', whereby adaptation can occur repeatedly across space and/or time, and the most recent adaptive episode is defined by one or more previously similar cases. The host plant shift of the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) (Diptera: Tephritidae, Carpomyini), from ancestral downy hawthorn [Crataegus mollis (Torr. & A. Gray) Scheele] to introduced, domesticated apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) in the eastern USA has long served as a model system for investigating ecologically driven host race formation in phytophagous insect specialists. Here, we report results from an annual geography survey of eclosion time demonstrating a similar ecological pattern among nascent host-associated populations of the fly recently introduced ca. 40 years ago from its native range in the east into the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the USA. Specifically, using data collected from 25 locations across 5 years, we show that apple-infesting fly populations in the PNW have rapidly and repeatedly shifted (and maintained differences in) their adult eclosion life-history timing to infest two novel hawthorn hosts with different fruiting phenologies - a native species (Crataegus douglasii Lindl.) and an introduced species (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) - generating partial allochronic reproductive isolation in the process. The shifts in the PNW parallel the classic case of host race formation in the eastern USA, but have occurred bi-directionally to two hawthorn species with phenologies slightly earlier (black hawthorn) and significantly later (ornamental hawthorn) than apple. Our results imply that R. pomonella can both possess and retain extensive-standing variation (i.e., 'adaptive memory') in diapause traits, even following introductions, to rapidly and temporally track novel phenological host opportunities when they arise. Thus, 'specialized' host races may not constitute evolutionary dead ends. Rather, adaptive phenotypic and genetic memory may carry over from one host shift to the next, recursively facilitating host race formation in phytophagous insects.

**On the Relationship between Zaprionus spinipilus Chassagnard & McEvey and Z. vittiger Coquillett, the Type Species of the Genus Zaprionus (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Yassin, A; Amabis, JM; Da Lage, JL; Debiais-Thibaud, M; David, JR. 2010

Zaprionus vittiger Coquillett is the type species of the genus Zaprionus Coquillett. However, the species is only known from five old museum specimens collected from South Africa and Malawi. It has often been confused with many other Zaprionus species, especially with Z. spinipilus Chassagnard & McEvey, a widespread species in Africa known from Madagascar, Malawi, Ethiopia and Cameroon. We have recently collected flies from the type localities of both species (South Africa and Madagascar, respectively). This has prompted us to test the taxonomic boundaries of these two nominal species using molecular (the mitochondrial COII and the nuclear Amyrel genes), chromosomal, morphological (internal and external genitalia), and reproductive isolation analyses. The results suggest Z. spinipilus to be a junior synonym to Z. vittiger.

**The effects of host race, gender, and host plant distribution on alighting behavior, mating, and oviposition in Eurosta solidaginis**

Horner, JD; Craig, TP; Itami, JK. 2008

Eurosta solidaginis Fitch (Diptera: Tephritidae) has formed host races on Solidago altissima L. and Solidago gigantea Ait. (Asteraceae), and reproductive isolation between these host races is brought about in part by host-associated assortative mating. Any non-assortative mating creates the potential for gene flow between the populations, and we investigated the conditions that favored non-assortative mating. We hypothesized that the frequency of non-assortative mating would be influenced by differences in the behaviors of the host races and sexes and by the presence and pattern of distribution of the two host species. To test these hypotheses, we caged flies on four combinations of 32 potted host plants: all S. altissima, all S. gigantea, and cages with both host species arranged in either two pure species blocks or randomly dispersed. We recorded the number of flies of each host race that alighted on each host species and the frequency of mating within and between the host races. Males of both host races were observed on plants more frequently than females. Flies of the host race from S. gigantea (gig flies) were observed on plants in greater absolute numbers, and they mated more frequently than flies of the host race from S. altissima (alt flies). In all treatments, gig flies of both sexes were found on non-natal host plants significantly more frequently than alt flies, and gig females showed a weaker preference for their host species than did gig males or alt flies of either gender for their respective natal hosts. Assortative mating predominated in all treatments, and flies from each host race mated more frequently in cages containing their own host plant. The frequency of non-assortative mating varied among treatments, with the matings between alt female x gig male being more common in the pure S. altissima treatment and the gig female x alt male being more frequent in the pure S. gigantea and random treatments. Matings between gig male x alt female were more common overall than the reciprocal mating, because gig males were more active in pursuing matings and in alighting on the non-natal host plant than alt flies. Non-assortative matings were more frequent in the random than in the block treatments, but this difference was not significant. Because of strong selection against oviposition into the alternate host, we hypothesized that host plant distribution would not affect oviposition preference. We tested this hypothesis by examining the oviposition behavior of naive, mated females in two treatments in which both host species were present: either arranged in blocks or randomly dispersed. Females oviposited only into their natal host, regardless of host plant distribution.

**Species delimitation in the Drosophila aldrichi subcluster (Diptera : Drosophilidae) using DNA sequences**

Oliveira, DCSG; Leonidas, M; Etges, WJ; O'Grady, PM; Desalle, R. 2008

DNA sequence data has been successfully used to verify current species-level taxonomic hypotheses based on morphology and other characters. Setting species boundaries in the Drosophila repleta group has been challenging because this group contains several cryptic taxa and morphologically polymorphic populations. Mitochondrial (cox1 and nad2) and nuclear (sina and Marf) genes were employed to assess species limits for two traditionally recognized, closely related, and taxonomically problematical species, D. aldrichi and D. wheeleri. Both tree-based and character-based methods were used to show that D. wheeleri is indeed a distinct species; however, our data shows that D. aldrichi is a paraphyletic assemblage of two lineages as previously suggested based on patterns of reproductive isolation. One lineage is sister to D. wheeleri and includes populations originating from southern and western Mexico (western-aldrichi). The second, basal group also contains flies from southern Mexico, along with populations from the northern and eastern regions within the species boundaries traditionally described as D. aldrichi (eastern-aldrichi). The populations of D. aldrichi that were introduced into Australia were found to be included in the eastern-aldrichi group. Our results, particularly those based on the rapidly evolving mtDNA sequences, confirm the presence of at least two cryptic species previously referred as "D. aldrichi".

**Combining morphology and molecular data to improve Drosophila paulistorum (Diptera, Drosophilidae) taxonomic status**

Zanini, R; Muller, MJ; Vieira, GC; Valiati, VH; Depra, M; Valente, VLD. 2018

The willistoni species subgroup has been the subject of several studies since the latter half of the past century and is considered a Neotropical model for evolutionary studies, given the many levels of reproductive isolation and different evolutionary stages occurring within them. Here we present for the first time a phylogenetic reconstruction combining morphological characters and molecular data obtained from 8 gene fragments (COI, COII, Cytb, Adh, Ddc, Hb, kl-3 and per). Some relationships were incongruent when comparing morphological and molecular data. Also, morphological data presented some unresolved polytomies, which could reflect the very recent divergence of the subgroup. The total evidence phylogenetic reconstruction presented well-supported relationships and summarized the results of all analyses. The diversification of the willistoni subgroup began about 7.3 Ma with the split of D. insularis while D.paulistorum complex has a much more recent diversification history, which began about 2.1 Ma and apparently has not completed the speciation process, since the average time to sister species separation is one million years, and some entities of the D. paulistorum complex diverge between 0.3 and 1 Ma. Based on the obtained data, we propose the categorization of the former semispecies of D. paulistorum as a subspecies and describe the subspecies D. paulistorum amazonian, D. paulistorum andeanbrazilian, D. paulistorum centroamerican, D. paulistorum interior, D. paulistorum orinocan and D. paulistorum transitional.

**Sexual conflict and reproductive isolation in flies**

Hosken, DJ; Martin, OY; Wigby, S; Chapman, T; Hodgson, DJ. 2009

Sexual conflict is predicted to generate more rapid reproductive isolation between larger populations. While there is some empirical support for this, the data are inconsistent and, additionally, there has been criticism of some of the evidence. Here we reanalyse two experimental-evolution datasets using an isolation index widely applied in the speciation literature. We find evidence for reproductive isolation through sexual conflict in Sepsis cynipsea, but not in Drosophila melanogaster, and this occurred to a greater degree in larger populations, which is consistent with previous findings.

**Evolution of male genitalia in the Drosophila repleta species group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Stefanini, MI; Gottschalk, MS; Calvo, NS; Soto, IM. 2021

The Drosophila repleta group comprises more than one hundred species that inhabit several environments in the Neotropics and use different hosts as rearing and feeding resources. Rather homogeneous in their external morphology, they are generally distinguished by the male genitalia, seemingly their fastest evolving morphological trait, constituting an excellent model to study patterns of genital evolution in the context of a continental adaptive radiation. Although much is known about the evolution of animal genitalia at population level, surveys on macroevolutionary scale of this phenomenon are scarce. This study used a suite of phylogenetic comparative methods to elucidate the macroevolutionary patterns of genital evolution through deep time and large continental scales. Our results indicate that male genital size and some aspects of shape have been evolving by speciational evolution, probably due to the microevolutionary processes involved in species mate recognition. In contrast, several features of the aedeagus shape seemed to have evolved in a gradual fashion, with heterogeneous evolutionary phenotypic rates among clades. In general, the tempo of the evolution of aedeagus morphology was constant from the origin of the group until the Pliocene, when it accelerated in some clades that diversified mainly in this period. The incidence of novel ecological conditions in the tempo of aedeagus evolution and the relationship between species mate recognition and speciation in the Drosophila repleta group are discussed.

**HOST FIDELITY IS AN EFFECTIVE PREMATING BARRIER BETWEEN SYMPATRIC RACES OF THE APPLE MAGGOT FLY**

FEDER, JL; OPP, SB; WLAZLO, B; REYNOLDS, K; GO, W; SPISAK, S. 1994

Models of sympatric speciation for phyto phagous insects posit a central role for host plant-associated mating as a premating isolating mechanism in lieu of geographic barriers to gene now. Here, by means of three mark-and-recapture studies, we confirm that host fidelity (i.e., the tendency of an insect to reproduce on the same host species that it used in earlier life-history stages) restricts gene flow between sympatric apple- and hawthorn-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) to approximate to 6% per generation. Genetically based differences in host preference, adult eclosion under the ''correct'' host species, and allochronic isolation contribute to host fidelity in various degrees in the races. The results verify that host-associated adaptation can produce reproductive isolation as a correlated character (a key premise of sympatric speciation). The study also represents one of the few or perhaps only example in animals where the intra-specific isolating effects of specific phenotypes have been quantified in nature.

**Diversity and Phylogeny of Wolbachia infecting Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera : Tephritidae) populations from China**

Sun, X; Cui, LW; Li, ZH. 2007

Wolbachia are a common and widespread group of symbiotic bacteria found in the reproductive tissues of arthropods. Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) is an important pest causing considerable economic losses of fruits and vegetables in several southern provinces of China. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with general Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) primers was used to test the presence of Wolbachia in 1,500 individuals of B. dorsalis from five geographical populations of China. We detected 19 individuals of B. dorsalis infected by Wolbachia, and the infection rates of different populations varied. Comparison of wsp gene sequences from 19 individuals and search of the GenBank identified four new sequences, probably representing four Wolbachia strains. Sequence comparison showed that the four Wolbachia strains from B. dorsalis in China belonged to three groups (Kue, Mel, and Cuc). Phylogenetic analysis of the wsp sequences suggests that geographical isolation of Wolbachia exists among the populations of B. dorsalis in China, and gene How of Wolbachia might have occurred between B. dorsalis populations of China and Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis performed on the host mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene and wsp gene suggests that host has coevolved with Wolbachia.

**Biology and evolution of the Epichloe-associated Botanophila species found in Europe (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)**

Leuchtmann, A; Michelsen, V. 2016

The anthomyiid genus Botanophila consists of over 200, mostly phytophagous, species. One species group maintains a mutualistic relationship with Epichloe fungi, thereby acting as vector of fungal spermatia required for fertilization, similar to pollinating parasites. The phylogenetic relationship of these flies with other Botanophila and the related Chiastocheta species (obligatory associated with globeflowers) remains largely unresolved. In this study, we obtained new sequences of the mitochondrial genes COI and COII from a representative sample of 17 European Botanophila and Chiastocheta species including all six Epichloe-associated species, as well as from four outgroup taxa. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Epichloe-associated Botanophila form a distinct clade suggesting that ancestral Botanophila may have expanded its niche to European fungal hosts once and then successfully radiated while exploiting fungal tissue as additional food source. Furthermore, the three included Chiastocheta species formed a distinct clade nested within Botanophila, leaving the genus paraphyletic as currently circumscribed.

**GENETIC DIVERGENCE ALONG THE SPECIATION CONTINUUM: THE TRANSITION FROM HOST RACE TO SPECIES IN RHAGOLETIS (DIPTERA: TEPHRITIDAE)**

Powell, THQ; Hood, GR; Murphy, MO; Heilveil, JS; Berlocher, SH; Nosil, P; Feder, JL. 2013

Studies of related populations varying in their degrees of reproductive isolation can provide insights into speciation. Here, the transition from partially isolated host races to more fully separated sibling species is investigated by comparing patterns of genetic differentiation between recently evolved (approximate to 150 generations) apple and ancestral hawthorn-infesting populations of Rhagoletis pomonella to their sister taxon, the undescribed flowering dogwood fly attacking Cornus florida. No fixed or diagnostic private alleles differentiating the three populations were found at any of 23 microsatellites and 10 allozymes scored. Nevertheless, allele frequency differences were sufficient across loci for flowering dogwood fly populations from multiple localities to form a diagnosable genotypic cluster distinct from apple and hawthorn flies, indicative of species status. Genome-wide patterns of differentiation were correlated between the host races and species pair comparisons along the majority of chromosomes, suggesting that similar disruptive selection pressures affect most loci. However, differentiation was more pronounced, with some additional regions showing elevated divergence, for the species pair comparison. Our results imply that Rhagoletis sibling species such as the flowering dogwood fly represent host races writ large, with the transition to species status primarily resulting from increased divergence of the same regions separating apple and hawthorn flies.

**Uncovering tropical diversity: six sympatric cryptic species of Blepharoneura (Diptera : Tephritidae) in flowers of Gurania spinulosa (Cucurbitaceae) in eastern Ecuador**

Condon, M; Adams, DC; Bann, D; Flaherty, K; Gammons, J; Johnson, J; Lewis, ML; Marsteller, S; Scheffer, SJ; Serna, F; Swensen, S. 2008

Diversification of phytophagous insects is often associated with changes in the use of host taxa and host parts. We focus on a group of newly discovered Neotropical tephritids in the genus Blepharoneura, and report the discovery of an extraordinary number of sympatric, morphologically cryptic species, all feeding as larvae on calyces of flowers of a single functionally dioecious and highly sexually dimorphic host species (Gurania spinulosa) in eastern Ecuador. Molecular analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase-I gene from flies reared from flowers of G. spinulosa reveal six distinct haplotype groups that differ by 7.2-10.1% bp (uncorrected pairwise distances; N = 624 bp). Haplotype groups correspond to six distinct and well-supported clades. Members of five clades specialize on the calyces of flowers of a particular sex: three clades comprise male flower specialists; two clades comprise female flower specialists; the sixth clade comprises generalists reared from male and female flowers. The six clades occupy significantly different morphological spaces defined by wing pigmentation patterns; however, diagnostic morphological characters were not discovered. Behavioural observations suggest specific courtship behaviours may play a role in maintaining reproductive isolation among sympatric species.

**An integrative multidisciplinary approach to understanding cryptic divergence in Brazilian species of the Anastrepha fraterculus complex (Diptera: Tephritidae)**

Dias, VS; Silva, JG; Lima, KM; Petitinga, CSCD; Hernandez-Ortiz, V; Laumann, RA; Paranhos, BJ; Uramoto, K; Zucchi, RA; Joachim-Bravo, IS. 2016

An integrative multidisciplinary approach was used to delimit boundaries among cryptic species within the Anastrepha fraterculus complex in Brazil. Sexual compatibility, courtship and sexual acoustic behaviour, female morphometric variability, variation for the mitochondrial gene COI, and the presence of Wolbachia were compared among A.fraterculus populations from the Southern (Vacaria, Pelotas, Bento Goncalves, SAo Joaquim) and Southeastern (Piracicaba) regions of Brazil. Our results suggest full mating compatibility among A.fraterculus populations from the Southern region and partial pre-zygotic reproductive isolation of these populations when compared with the population from the Southeastern region. A.fraterculus populations from both regions differed in the frequency of courtship displays and aspects of the calling phase and mounting acoustic signal. Morphometric analysis showed differences between Southern region and Southeastern region samples. All populations analyzed were infected with Wolbachia. The trees generated from the COI sequencing data are broadly congruent with the behavioural and morphometric data with the exception of one Southern population. The likely mechanisms by which A.fraterculus populations might have diverged are discussed in detail based on behavioural, morphometric, molecular genetics, and biogeographical studies.

**Assortative mating among Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) hybrids as a possible route to radiation of the fraterculus cryptic species complex**

Segura, DF; Vera, MT; Rull, J; Wornoayporn, V; Islam, A; Robinson, AS. 2011

Reproductive isolation among populations of Anastrepha fraterculus has been found acting at the pre- and post-zygotic levels. Differences in timing of sexual activity and male sexual pheromone composition among populations could partially account for prezygotic isolation. **Hybrid** males were found to produce a novel pheromone, which is a mix of parental pheromones. In the present study, we found that the **hybrid** females showed a significant preference to mate with **hybrid** males than with parental males. Male location during pheromone emission is associated with its reproductive success and, thus, differences in the location of males during courtship could also play a role in isolation. We found evidence that reproductive isolation is also related to the location of males during courtship. **Hybrid** male behaviour regarding location during pheromone release was found to be influenced by the maternal lineage. If these populations **hybrid**ized in the field, the **hybrid** females would tend to mate with **hybrid** males probably leading to the formation of a new entity within the A. fraterculus complex. This simple and fast process could be one reason explaining the high number of taxonomic entities within this complex. Further studies on other members of the fraterculus species group may reveal whether this can be considered as an example of homoploid **hybrid** speciation.

**Is Cote D'Ivoire a new high hybridization zone for the two major malaria vectors, Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae (Diptera, Culicidae)?**

Caputo, B; Tondossoma, N; Virgillito, C; Pichler, V; Serini, P; Calzetta, M; Manica, M; Coulibaly, ZI; Dia, I; Akr, M; Offianan, A; della Torre, A. 2022

Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii are very closely related and recently differentiated species representing the main malaria vectors in the Afrotropical region and responsible of up to >3 infective bites/person/night in Cote D'Ivoire, where prevention and control has stagnated in recent years. The aim of the present study was to genetically and ecologically characterize An. gambiae and An. coluzzii populations from two villages of Cote D'Ivoire, lying in the coastal forest belt and 250 km inland in the Guinean savannah mosaic belt, respectively. Results reveal high frequencies of both species in both study sites and high frequencies of **hybrid**s (4-33%) along the whole year of sampling. Consistently with observations for the well-known high **hybrid**ization zone at the far -west of the species range, **hybrid** frequencies were higher in the coastal village and highest when the two species occurred at more balanced frequencies, supporting the "frequency-dependent **hybrid**ization" ecological specia-tion theory. Pilot genotyping revealed signatures of genomic admixture in both chromosome-X and-3. Coupled with previous reports of **hybrid**s in the region, the results point to the coastal region of Cote D'Ivoire as a possible regions of high **hybrid**ization. Preliminary characterization of parameters relevant for malaria transmission and control (e.g. possibly higher sporozoite rates and indoor biting preferences in **hybrid**s than in the parental species) highlight the possible relevance of the breakdown of reproductive barriers between An. gambiae and An. coluzzii not only in the field of ecological evolution, but also in malaria epidemiology and control.

**Haldane's rule and other aspects of reproductive isolation observed in the Anastrepha fraterculus complex (Diptera : Tephritidae)**

Selivon, D; Perondini, ALP; Morgante, JS. 1999

Some aspects of reproductive isolation between allopatric populations of two closely related species of the Anastrepha fraterculus complex (A. fraterculus sp. 1 and sp. 2) were evaluated in laboratory conditions. Most of the crosses were fertile in each species as well as between sp. 2 females and sp. 1 males. In the reciprocal cross only 41.7% of the matings yielded viable progeny. Egg hatching occurred at similar rates within the two species, but was significantly lower in the crosses between the species. Adult emergence did not differ significantly among crosses. The sex ratio of adult progeny within each species, as well as in the **hybrid** progeny derived from sp. 1 females crossed to sp. 2 males, did not differ from the expected 1:1 ratio. However, in the crosses between sp. 2 females to sp. 1 males, a significant deviation in the sex ratio in favor of females was observed, according to the Haldane's rule. The results reinforce previous data which indicated that A. fraterculus sp. 1 and A. fraterculus sp. 2 are distinct biological entities.

**Cross-order transfer of Wolbachia from Muscidifurax uniraptor (Hymenoptera : Pteromalidae) to Drosophila simulans (Diptera : Drosophilidae)**

Van Meer, MMM; Stouthamer, R. 1999

Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are widespread in arthropods and can induce different effects on the host such as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), thelytoky (T) or feminization (F). In some Wolbachia-infected hosts, no effect (N) has been found. Successful transfer of Wolbachia by microinjection from one host to an uninfected one has been established with CI, F, N-Wolbachia but not with T-Wolbachia. In this paper a transfer experiment of T-Wolbachia from the parasitoid Muscidifurax uniraptor to Drosophila simulans is described. The infection could be detected in the new host for several generations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, no specific effects on the host were detected, and the bacteria were not stably maintained.

**Intraspecific variation of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles in the Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) species complex**

Vanickova, L; Brizova, R; Mendonca, AL; Pompeiano, A; Do Nascimento, RR. 2015

The goal of this study was to define whether cuticular hydrocarbons (CHs) could be used for taxonomic determination of putative species hidden in the Anastrepha fraterculus cryptic species complex, widespread from Argentina to Mexico. Recently, increasing evidence of phenotypic and genetic variability has resulted in the characterization of eight morphotypes within this complex. The CH profiles of six A.fraterculus populations from Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Mexico were analysed in this study by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. In parallel, multiple factorial analyses were used to elucidate population structures. Vector populations segregated into four distinct groups. The analysis demonstrated that the studied populations from Peru, Argentina and southern Brazil (Vacaria) might be classified in accordance with the earlier division of the A.fraterculus complex into Peruvian, and Brazilian-1 cryptic species, using the specific CH profiles. Population from south-eastern Brazil (Piracicaba) formed separated group. Mexican and Andean (Colombian) putative species had similar CH signatures, when compared to each other.

**Taxonomy and phenotypic relationships of the Anastrepha fraterculus complex in the Mesoamerican and Pacific Neotropical dominions (Diptera, Tephritidae)**

Hernandez-Ortiz, V; Canal, NA; Salas, JOT; Ruiz-Hurtado, FM; Dzul-Cauich, JF. 2015

Previous morphometric studies based on linear measurements of female structures of the aculeus, mesonotum, and wing revealed the existence of seven morphotypes within the Anastrepha fraterculus cryptic species complex along the Neotropical Region. The current research followed linear and geometric morphometric approaches in 40 population samples of the nominal species A. fraterculus (Wiedemann) spread throughout the Meso-American and Pacific Neotropical dominions (including Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). The goals were to explore the phenotypic relationships of the morphotypes in these biogeographical areas; evaluate the reliability of procedures used for delimitation of morphotypes; and describe their current distribution. Findings determined that morphotypes previously recognized via the linear morphometrics were also supported by geometric morphometrics of the wing shape. In addition, we found an eighth morphotype inhabiting the highlands of Ecuador and Peru. Morphotypes are related into three natural phenotypic groups nominated as Mesoamerican-Caribbean lineage, Andean lineage, and Brazilian lineage. The hypothesis that lineages are not directly related to each other is discussed, supported by their large morphological divergence and endemicity in these three well-defined biogeographic areas. In addition, this hypothesis of the non-monophyly of the A. fraterculus complex is also supported by evidence from other authors based on molecular studies and the strong reproductive isolation between morphs from different lineages.

**Distribution, host plant affiliation, phenology, and phylogeny of walnut-infesting Rhagoletis flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Mexico**

Rull, J; Aluja, M; Tadeo, E; Guillen, L; Egan, S; Glover, M; Feder, JL. 2013

Many taxa of Nearctic origin have diversified in the subtropical highlands of Mexico. In particular, flies in the genus Rhagoletis have undergone episodes of isolation and gene flow during Pleistocene glaciations and post-glacial times that have produced lineage differentiation and reproductive isolation. To reach a better understanding of the phylogeography of the genus Rhagoletis, a host plant survey of the walnut-infesting Rhagoletis suavis species group was conducted across sixteen states comprising 34 different collecting sites in Mexico over a 9-year period. Five species of Juglans were found to be infested by three species of walnut-attacking Rhagoletis flies. Several species of parasitoids were also recovered from collections, but in contrast to their walnut fly hosts, they revealed little evidence for host or geographic subdivision. There was no consistent difference in mean eclosion time between walnut fly species or populations associated with different host walnuts in Mexico, unlike the case for other Rhagoletis species, in which allochronic isolation arising from variation in diapause timing is a major ecological adaptation, reproductively isolating flies. We compare the distribution of R.suavis flies in Mexico with those of other Rhagoletis species attacking hawthorns and cherries, and discuss its implications for population divergence and speciation.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

**A comparison of the intraspecific variability of Phlebotomus sergenti Parrot, 1917 (Diptera : Psychodidae)**

Dvorak, V; Aytekin, AM; Alten, B; Skarupova, S; Votypka, J; Volf, P. 2006

Phlebotomus sergenti populations from different areas of the Mediterranean basin are known to exhibit high intraspecific variability. Previous studies of ITS2 revealed the presence of two branches that may represent sibling species. To corroborate this finding by other tools, two colonies of P sergenti originating from Turkey and Israel, each belonging to a different ITS2 branch, were compared by three different methods: geometric morphometric analysis of wing shape, RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA), and cross-mating study. For geometric morphometric analysis, two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of 16 landmarks from the wings were digitized and analyzed. Significant shape differences were found between colonies but not between sexes within each colony. RAPD results formed two distinctive clades Corresponding to the origin of the colony but also showed heterogenity among members of both colonies. In cross-mating studies, viable **hybrid** F1 and F2 progeny were obtained when both Turkish males/Israeli females and Israeli males/Turkish females were crossed. F I progeny was included in RAPD analysis and these **hybrid**s formed a distinctive clade with an intermediate position between the two parental clades. No significant differences were found in egg production of crossed sand flies. The cross-mating study showed that there is no reproductive barrier between P. sergenti from different geographical areas. On the other hand, RAPD and geometric morphometric analysis revealed a significant difference between colonies and confirmed the suitability of previous ITS2 analysis for discrimination among sand fly populations. Further development of molecular markers should resolve a possible existence of sibling species within Phlebotomus sergenti.

**MODIFICATION OF FEMALE ONION FLY, DELIA-ANTIQUA (MEIGEN), REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR BY MALE PARAGONIAL GLAND EXTRACTS (DIPTERA, ANTHOMYIIDAE)**

SPENCER, JL; BUSH, GL; KELLER, JE; MILLER, JR. 1992

Egg depositional rates of onion flies, Delia antiqua (Meigen), injected thoracically with extracts of male paragonial glands were identical (14.5 eggs/female/day) to those of normally mated females. Moreover, when continuously exposed to males, extract-injected females refused to mate and produced unfertilized eggs for the duration of the > 15-day experiment. For this normally monocoitic dipteran, < 1 male equiv of paragonial secretion completely reproduced the ovipositional responses characteristic of normal mating, and this effect required no involvement of the genitalia or genital chamber. We suggest that the receptor for the active chemical(s) (sex peptide ?) would be an excellent target for biorational insect control by sterilization. Moreover, these primer sex pheromones might play an important role in insect reproductive isolation and evolution.

**Long-term coexistence of a hybridization-derived population ofDrosophila parapallidosawith closely relatedDrosophila ananassae(Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Hama, Y; Lee, CY; Matsuda, M; Kamimura, Y; Sawamura, K. 2020

A 2012-13 survey on Penang Island, Malaysia, revealed the existence of bothDrosophila ananassaeandDrosophila parapallidosa, the latter of which carries chromosomes Y and 4 fromD. ananassaeand thus is of **hybrid** origin. We collected the flies again from the same location in 2018. The **hybrid** population remained present, which suggests that theD. parapallidosaof **hybrid** origin does not represent a mere transient population but is stable. Why do these two species coexist irrespective of gene flow? We realized that body size is generally larger inD. ananassaethan inD. parapallidosa, which constitutes a new character with which to discriminate these species; previously the number of sex comb teeth was the only diagnostic trait. Character displacement was not detected, however, for those traits. We crossed these two species, which resulted in offspring that had an altered genomic constitution. The body size ofD. ananassaewas dominant, and the presence of chromosomes Y and 4 did not have a significant effect on body size. By contrast, the presence of chromosome 4 fromD. ananassaesignificantly affected the number of sex comb teeth. Even flies having a genomic constitution similar to that of the PenangD. parapallidosaexhibited a number of sex comb teeth that was intermediate between the two species. We propose that theD. parapallidosasex comb character underwent selection during evolution of the Penang Island population. Reproductive interference between the species, presumably caused by signal jamming, was detected.

**Taxonomic boundaries, phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of the Drosophila willistoni subgroup (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Robe, LJ; Cordeiro, J; Loreto, ELS; Valente, VLS. 2010

The Drosophila willistoni subgroup represents a complex with varying taxonomic levels. It encompasses D. willistoni and its five sibling species: D. equinoxialis, D. insularis, D. paulistorum, D. pavlovskiana and D. tropicalis. Of these, D. equinoxialis, D. tropicalis and D. willistoni present differentiation at subspecific level, whereas D. paulistorum represents a superspecies, formed by six semispecies. Despite this taxonomic and evolutionary complexity, many of these semi and subspecific taxa have not yet had their phylogenetic status tested in an explicitly molecular study. Aiming to contribute to the understanding of the evolution of this challenging group, we analyzed nucleotide sequences from two mitochondrial and four nuclear datasets, both individually and simultaneously, through different phylogenetic methods. High levels of incongruence were detected among partitions, especially concerning the mitochondrial sequences. As this incongruence was found to be statistically significant and robust to the use of different models and approaches, and basically restricted to mitochondrial loci, we suggest that it may stem mainly from **hybrid**ization-mediated asymmetrical introgression. Despite this, our nuclear data finally led to a phylogenetic hypothesis which further refines several aspects related to the willistoni subgroup phylogeny. In this respect, D. insularis, D. tropicalis, D. willistoni and D. equinoxialis successively branched off from the willistoni subgroup main stem, which recently subdivided to produce D. paulistorum and D. pavlovskiana. As regards the semispecies evolution, we found evidence of a recent diversification, which highly influenced the obtained results due to the associated small levels of genetic differentiation, further worsened by the possibly associated incompletely sorted ancestral polymorphisms and by the possibility of introgression. This study also raises the question of whether these semispecies are monophyletic at all. This reasoning is particularly interesting when one considers that similar levels of reproductive isolation could be attained through infection with different Wolbachia strains.

**Molecular and Morphometrical Revision of the Zaprionus tuberculatus Species Subgroup (Diptera: Drosophilidae), with Descriptions of Two Cryptic Species**

Yassin, A. 2008

Zaprionus is an important drosophilid genus in the Afrotropical region. Here, two new species, Z. burlai n. sp. and Z. tsacasi n. sp., are described from Tanzania and Sao Tome, respectively. The two species show incomplete reproductive isolation with Z. tuberculatus Malloch and Z. sepsoides Duda, respectively, with intercrosses producing fertile females but sterile males. The latter two have long been considered sibling species and together with three other species (Z. mascariensis Tsacas & David, Z. kolodkinae Chassagnard & Tsacas, and Z. cerruca Chassagnard & McEvey) form the tuberculatus subgroup. The phylogenetic relationships of these seven species of the subgroup were revised in light of mitochondrial (COII) gene sequences and wing morphometrics. Mitochondrial DNA firmly distinguished most of the species, except for a triad of Z. tuberculatus, Z. cerruca, and Z. burlai. Wing morphometrics was able to distinguish between closely related species and also indicated the altitudinal origin of each species. Most species can be identified through internal anatomy of the reproductive system (testis and seminal receptacle lengths), and the discovery of the new species with incomplete reproductive isolation may help in understanding the genetic basis of this variation through interspecific **hybrid**ization. The molecular phylogeny reconfirmed the Malagasy origin of the subgroup during the Late Pliocene. Colonization of Africa probably involved two independent events during the Pleistocene.

**Host specialization, genetic variability, and differentiation in three species of Tomoplagia from Brazilian rupestrian grasslands**

Leal, CRO; de Souza, AP; Silva-Brandao, KL; Lewinsohn, TM. 2022

In this study, the geographic and host plant-associated genetic structure of Tomoplagia spp. (Diptera: Tephritidae) was investigated. The study was developed in the rupestrian montane grasslands of the Espinhaco Mountain Range, Brazil, where these flies' larvae develop within flower heads of Asteraceae. The three species of Tomoplagia investigated have different host spans within the subtribe Vernoniinae: one is strictly monophagous (Tomoplagia grandis Prado, Norrbom & Lewinsohn) and two are oligophagous [Tomoplagia incompleta (Williston) and Tomoplagia bicolor Prado, Norrbom & Lewinsohn]. The genetic variability and differentiation throughout their geographic distribution were investigated at the local scale (sympatric, between different host species in the same locality) and the regional scale (allopatric, on the same or different host species in different localities). Allele richness was greater for populations of the two oligophagous species. Moreover, population genetic structure was low in all species both on the local and regional scales, and the attribution of individuals of the three species to different genetic groups was not strongly associated with either locality or host plant. These results indicate the absence of simple geographic and host-associated genetic structure in these specialized herbivores, suggesting that females of T. bicolor and T. incompleta have low host philopatry, using various host species indiscriminately within their distribution range. Therefore, the use of host plants by fruit flies of the genus Tomoplagia is a plastic character that can shift temporally and spatially among phylogenetically related and chemically similar plants. Contrary to expectations, given the specialized and intimate nature of their host association, the studied Tomoplagia species showed no clear host-associated genetic differentiation; instead, genetic variation presents a mosaic pattern across hosts and localities.

**Molecular and cytogenetic evidence of three sibling species of the Anopheles barbirostris Form A (Diptera : Culicidae) in Thailand**

Saeung, A; Baimai, V; Otsuka, Y; Rattanarithikul, R; Somboon, P; Junkum, A; Tuetun, B; Takaoka, H; Choochote, W. 2008

Nine isoline colonies of Anopheles barbirostris Form A, derived from individual isofemale lines from Chiang Mai, Phetchaburi, and Kanchanaburi, were established in our insectary at Chiang Mai University. All isolines shared the same mitotic karyotype (X-1, X-2, Y-1). Molecular analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of ITS2, COI, and COII regions revealed three distinct groups: A1 (Chiang Mai), A2 (Phetchaburi), and A3 (Kanchanaburi). Crossing experiments among the three groups exhibited strong reproductive isolation, producing low and/or non-hatched eggs, and inviable and/or abnormal development of the reproductive system of F-1-progenies. Asynaptic regions along the five polytene chromosome arms of F-1-**hybrid** larvae clearly supported the existence of three sibling species within A. barbirostris Form A, provisionally named species A1, A2, and A3.

**Reproductive biology and isolation mechanisms in rupicolous species of the Acianthera prolifera complex (Orchidaceae) occurring in southeastern Brazil**

de Melo, MC; Taucce, PPG; Borba, EL. 2011

We studied the floral biology and performed experimental intra- and interspecific pollinations in populations of a complex of four Acianthera (Orchidaceae) species occurring in Brazilian campo rupestre vegetation (A. hamosa, A. limae, A. modestissima, and A. prolifera). All four species flower synchronously, are partially intercompatible, and exhibited some degree of self-sterility. Floral morphology is similar in all the species, with their principal differences associated with size of the floral structures. The four species were visited only by Diptera species of the families Phoridae (Megaselia spp.) and Chloropidae, but visits are rare and fruit set is very low. Sympatric species were not pollinated by the same Diptera species. Acianthera hamosa and A. modestissima have the smallest flowers, and no marked morphological differences between them were observed; they were both pollinated by very similar Megaselia species. Both prepollination barriers and postpollination events are important to maintaining the isolation of the species, functioning as overlapping filters that diminish the possibility of gene flow between them. However, putative **hybrid**s between A. prolifera and A. limae have been found. Conversely, A. hamosa and A. modestissima, which are recognized only by vegetative characters that show high phenotypic plasticity, seem only to be isolated by geographical barriers, and they may actually constitute a single species or be sister species.

**First record of Culex (Culex) bidens (Diptera: Culicidae) in Colombia: Taxonomic and epidemiological implications**

Laurito, M; Hoyos-Lopez, R. 2018

Arbovirus transmission cycles must be studied locally since both vectors and hosts vary in different regions. Colombia has a highly diverse mosquito fauna. Culex (Culex) bidens is reported here for the first time in Colombia. Because Cx. bidens Dyar and Knab and Cx. declarator Dyar and Knab share a close taxonomic history and because it is difficult to differentiate between them, a morphological and molecular comparison was performed. The male genitalia of three specimens of Cx. bidens from Colombia were mounted on microscope slides and morphologically compared with the male genitalia of Cx. declarator also from Colombia. In Cx. bidens, the individual teeth of the lateral plate are long, straight, laterally directed and sharply pointed; in Cx. declarator these teeth are robust, curved, with convex margins and bluntly rounded. Moreover, DNA was extracted from the same specimens and a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene was amplified and sequenced. Neither Cx. bidens nor Cx. declarator were clustered in the Neighbour-joining topology, with K2P interspecific divergence between 0.15-1.45%. The circulation of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus in Colombia was reported since 1957 and Cx. bidens was suspected to be the vector of this virus during an epizootic in Argentina in 1988. **Hybrid**ization between species of the subgenus Culex has been demonstrated, hence the degree of reproductive isolation between Cx. bidens and Cx. declarator should be investigated, as well as their taxonomic status, because they only can be discriminated by a single male genitalic feature and not by nuclear or mitochondrial markers.

**Integrative taxonomy and a new species description in the sturtevanti subgroup of the Drosophila saltans group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

Madi-Ravazzi, L; Segala, LF; Roman, BE; Alevi, KCC; Prediger, C; Yassin, A; Hua-Van, A; Miller, WJ. 2021

Although the biological concept of species is well established in animals, sometimes the decision about the specific status of a new species is difficult and hence requires support of an integrative analysis of several character sets. To date, the species Drosophila sturtevanti, D. magalhaesi, D. milleri and D. dacunhai, belonging to the sturtevanti subgroup of the Neotropical saltans species group, are identified mainly by the aedeagus morphology, but also present some differences in spot coloration and patterning of the female sixth tergite and in the shape and size of the spermathecae, parallel to a pattern of reproductive isolation. In the present study, we describe a novel saltans group species from French Guiana belonging to the sturtevanti subgroup. Our species designation is based on an integrative approach covering (i) aedeagi and spermathecae morphology by scanning electron microscopy, (ii) analysis of female sixth-tergite color, (iii) morphometrical analysis of aedeagi and wings, (iv) analysis of partial sequence of the COI, COII and ND4 mitochondrial genes as well as (v) intercrosses for analysis of reproductive isolation. The comparative analysis of the results on these markers with those of D. sturtevanti, D. milleri and D. dacunhai supports that this line belongs to a new species of the sturtevanti subgroup that we name Drosophila lehrmanae sp. nov. in honor of Prof. Lee Ehrman ' s 85th birthday.

**Biology and adaptive radiation in the gall-inducing Cecidomyiidae (Insecta Diptera) and Calophyidae (Insecta Hemiptera) on Mangifera indica (Anacardiaceae) in the Indian subcontinent**

Raman, A; Burckhardt, D; Harris, KM. 2009

Out of the nearly 250 species of plant-feeding arthropods that utilize Mangifera indica, about 25 gall midge species (Diptera Cecidomyiidae) (mostly species of Procontarinia Kieffer & Cecconi 1906) and one psylloid species (Apsylla cistellata (Buckton 1893), Hemiptera Calophyidae) are the known gall-inducing taxa. Almost all of these gall midges induce galls on leaves, whereas the psylloid induces galls on axillary vegetative buds. The M. indica-associated species of Procontarinia do not show any striking level of shifts either between organs within M. indica or between other Indian anacardiaceous taxa such as Anacardium, Buchanania, Lannea, Holigarna, Pistacia, and Semecarpus, which, in fact, host several other species of Cecidomyiidae and Calophyidae. Given that galls induced by a suspected gall-midge species on the fossil leaves of an ancestral taxon of Mangifera indica from the Upper Palaeocene sediments of north-eastern India exist, the lack of radiation from leaves either to other organs of M. indica or to other anacardiaceous extant taxa suggests that neither the feeding behaviour nor the larval salivary physiology of species of Procontarinia has changed over time. The reason for such a conservative behaviour could be either the lack of resistance-breaking genes in the M. indica-associated Procontarinia complex or the abundance of populations of M. indica. A provisional reconstruction of the relationships among the extant M. indica-infesting gall-inducing Cecidomyiidae reveals that an extremely modest level of radiation in the leaf-gall-inducing species has occurred from those species that induce structurally simple galls to those that induce structurally complex galls. Because M. indica is an evergreen, polyaxial species, with new leaf flushes available almost throughout the year, and thus offering a continuous nutritional supply, the radiation and diversification of gall midges could have been restricted. In addition, the diverse, geographically localized varieties of M. indica with different types of secondary chemicals (e.g., xanthones and flavanols) may have also imposed a selection pressure on the radiation of gall midges; for instance, mangiferin, the principal secondary chemical present in M. indica, possibly acts as an attractant to the Cecidomyiidae and Apsylla cistellata and has, consequently, restricted their diversification. We speculate that the gall midges may have progressed conservatively specializing along the host-plant lines, because of the need for precise timing and for minimizing competitive interactions with other parasitic, predatory, and inquilinous arthropods, from the time of original host colonization. Available data on the gall-inducing species of the Procontarinia complex on the leaves of M. indica indicates that both the location and structure of galls generally agree with the patterns evident in other groups of gall-inducing insects, which induce galls of similar morphology, suggesting pathways of Procontarinia phylogeny. Galls of different morphologies occur concurrently, mostly on the leaves of M. indica, and such an occurrence needs to be explored to establish the origin of multiple species of Procontarinia. In the context of M. indica-associated gall midges, only Procontarinia mangiferae lives both on stems and leaves of M. indica, indicating a critical step in Procontarinia speciation, through reproductive isolation involving phenological separation. Different species of Procontarinia occur on the same host tree and on the same leaf, but how different populations of gall-midge taxa partitio their resources effectively and reduce inter-specific competition remain as questions. Effective utilization of the host plant and consequent speciation in the Procontarinia complex have resulted from the condition that continuously blossoming individual trees of M. indica are available throughout extensive landscapes. But apart from these speculative propositions, a need for empirical studies on the phylogeny and interactions between Procontarinia (and related genera) and M. indica exists. In Calophyidae, Apsylla Crawford 1912 did not speciate on M. indica; this may also be true for the three species of Calophya Lbw 1879 associated with M. indica. Due to insufficient information this proposition remains unverified.

**Characterisation of the chemical profiles of Brazilian and Andean morphotypes belonging to the Anastrepha fraterculus complex (Diptera, Tephritidae)**

Vanickova, L; Brizova, R; Pompeiano, A; Ferreira, LL; de Aquino, NC; Tavares, RD; Rodriguez, LD; Mendonca, AD; Canal, NA; do Nascimento, RR. 2015

Fruit fly sexual behaviour is directly influenced by chemical and non-chemical cues that play important roles in reproductive isolation. The chemical profiles of pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons (CHs) of eight fruit fly populations of the Andean, Brazilian-1 and Brazilian-3 morphotypes of the Anastrepha fraterculus cryptic species complex originating from Colombia (four populations) and Brazil (four populations) were analysed using two-dimensional gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The resulting chemical diversity data were studied using principal component analyses. Andean morphotypes could be discriminated from the Brazilian-1 and Brazilian-3 morphotypes by means of male-borne pheromones and/or male and female CH profiles. The Brazilian-1 and Brazilian-3 morphotypes were found to be monophyletic. The use of chemical profiles as species-and sex-specific signatures for cryptic species separations is discussed.

**Pheromone emission patterns and courtship sequences across distinct populations within Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera-Tephritidae) cryptic species complex**

Roriz, AKP; Japyassu, HF; Caceres, C; Vera, MT; Joachim-Bravo, IS. 2019

Sexual behavioural isolation can result from sexual selection and represents a relevant factor associated with the speciation process. We analysed the pheromone emission pattern and the courtship of males of five different populations of the Anastrepha fraterculus cryptic complex: Brazil (Vacaria, Tucuman and Piracicaba), Colombia and Peru. The time of pheromone emission was recorded in each population every 30 min during the day. The behavioural sequences of courting were video recorded and analysed using EthoSeq software. Males from different populations have showed different period of pheromone emission - Vacaria, Piracicaba and Tucuman executed calling only during the morning, Colombia only in the afternoon and Peru during both periods. The general frequencies of the courtship units of the males were distinct among the populations. Three groups were formed in the classification from the function of 14 behavioural routines: Vacaria, Piracicaba and Tucuman formed a single group (Brazil-1), while Colombia and Peru formed two distinct groups. In the probabilistic trees generated, the behavioural units that most contributed to the occurrence of copulation were distinct among the three groups formed: Brazil-1 (Contact, Alignment and Arrowhead-1); Colombia (Flying, Mobile, Contact and Alignment); Peru (Flying, Arrowhead-1 and Calling). Our results indicated differences in sexual behaviour that may explain the behavioural isolation found between the distinct groups in addition with the temporal isolation found between the Brazil-1 and Colombia populations. The evolutionary implications for the A. fraterculus cryptic species complex are discussed.

**Trends in the changes of the postgonites in the frit fly genus Meromyza (Diptera: Chloropidae)**

Yatsuk, AA; Safonkin, AF. 2018

The common patterns and trends of microevolutionary transformations in the shape of the front appendix of postgonites in 27 species of Meromyza frit flies are revealed using morphometric analysis. Geometric morphometry was performed using program packages TPS and MorphoJ. To digitize shapes, there were placed 24 landmarks, reflecting contours of the front appendix of postgonites, allowing to detect any change in the shape that affects the reproductive isolation of species. The intercluster variability is characterized by three main components, attributable to: I (47.75%) changes in the shape of the lower edge, II (16.64%) elongation of the protruding part, III (14.83%) expansion of the line of the postgonites affixing. Within each cluster, the pattern of species separation through the changes in the shape of postgonites front appendix is investigated. In clusters pluriseta, nigriseta and, especially, athletica and zachvatkini, the variability of the upper edge of postgonites plays the most important role. In cluster groups meigeni and inornata variability was noticed along the whole contour of postgonites, while in clusters saltatrix and pratorum along the bottom edge and at the end of the protruding part. Mahalanobis distance calculation showed that in the studied contours of postgonites front appendix there are no matching clusters, and in each of them there are no fully overlapping contours. The morphometric analysis confirms species grouping, previously suggested by the results of the mtDNA locus CO1 studies, into 8 clusters.

**Comparative studies of stenogamous behaviour in the mosquito Culex pipiens complex**

Kim, S; Trocke, S; Sim, C. 2018

Understanding the processes of reproductive behaviour in mosquitoes is crucial for improving mating competitiveness and mating specificity for sterile insect release programmes. The Culex pipiens (Linneaus) (Diptera: Culicidae) forms pipiens and molestus (Forskal), two biotypes of the Cx. pipiens complex, are vectors for West Nile virus, St Louis encephalitis virus and lymphatic filariases. **Hybrid**ization of these biotypes is known to occur in nature, although form pipiens mates above ground in large spaces (eurygamy) and form molestus preferentially mates in small spaces (stenogamy) such as sewage tunnels. **Hybrid**ization may allow gene flow of biotype-specific characteristics that are crucial in the disease transmission cycle. The present study examined and compared mating behaviours, insemination rates, fecundity and fertility in parental and F1 **hybrid**s between Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. pipiens f. molestus in conditions of stenogamy. Unique mating behaviour sequences were identified in Cx. pipiens f. molestus, including tapping, mounting, co-flying and copulation. Despite the considerably high insemination rates in **hybrid** crosses, fertility and fecundity rates were varied. This observation could suggest reproductive isolation in the **hybrid** zone. The study also documents a failure of heterospecific males to produce fertile eggs in Cx. pipiens f. pipiens females, which may be attributable to gametic incompatibilities and may represent an additional barrier to gene exchange.

**Behavioural barriers to reproduction may evolve faster than sexual morphology among populations of a dung fly (Sepsidae)**

Puniamoorthy, N. 2014

Reproductive traits often evolve rapidly, and some suggest that behavioural traits, in particular, can diverge faster than morphology, resulting in sexual isolation between populations/species. An earlier study of a Neotropical dung fly, Archisepsis diversiformis (Diptera: Sepsidae), reported anecdotally that two central American populations that were approximately 500 km apart (Costa Rica and Panama) differed in male courtship behaviour despite being morphologically similar. Here, I present results of an in- depth study designed (1) to test whether these two populations show qualitative and/or quantitative differences in mating behaviour and morphology, (2) to test whether individuals from either population show some degree of reproductive isolation and (3) to characterize population variation in a particularly fast evolving mitochondrial gene fragment, cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI), to estimate genetic differences between the two populations. Despite similarities in overall courtship, I identified behaviours that were clearly population specific, and report that both populations showed strong premating isolation in one- on- one crosses. However, after extended exposure in mass-container group crosses, individuals did produce adult F1 offspring, suggesting that isolation is incomplete. Surprisingly, morphometric analyses indicated that these two populations differed significantly in sexually monomorphic adult wing shape but differed only moderately in sexually dimorphic male forefemur shape, and not at all in male genital clasper shape. Finally, both populations were genetically similar, forming a single, monophyletic cluster with low uncorrected pairwise distances (COI threshold < 1 %), suggesting that marked behavioural differences between both populations have evolved quickly but without complete isolation.

**Genetic correlations between life-history and behavioral traits can cause reproductive isolation**

Miyatake, T; Shimizu, T. 1999

Reproductive isolation may often evolve as an indirect (pleiotropic) consequence of populations adapting to different environments or habitats. For example, niches that are temporally or seasonally offset can select for organisms with different developmental characteristics. These developmental differences can inadvertently cause reproductive isolation by a variety of means including shifts in mating activity patterns. Here, we show a genetic correlation between a life-history trait (developmental period) and a behavioral trait (time of mating) that causes significant premating isolation in the melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae). Fly lines selected for short and long developmental periods differ in their preferred times of mating during the evening. This difference translates into significant prezygotic isolation, as measured by mate choice tests. If the time of mating between two populations differed more than one hour, the isolation index was significantly higher than zero. These indicate that premating isolation can be established if the developmental period in divergently selected for. If such genetic correrlations are ubiquitous in many organisms, multifarious divergent selection for life-history traits would often accelerate the evolution of reproductive isolation. We speculate that reproductive isolation may have been evolved via genetic correlations among time-related traits, for example, developmental period and time of mating, as in other organisms.

**An experimental assessment of reproductive isolation and its consequences for seasonal hybridization dynamics**

Foucault, Q; Wieser, A; Heumann-Kiesler, C; Diogo, J; Cocchiararo, B; Nowak, C; Waldvogel, AM; Pfenninger, M. 2019

While the spatial aspect of **hybrid**ization has been investigated in depth, the temporal aspect has not. We analysed the seasonal **hybrid**ization dynamics of a multivoltine non-biting midge sister species pair, Chironomus riparius and C. piger. We investigated the fertility and fitness of F-1 **hybrid**s, and all possible first-generation backcross **hybrid**s, under different temperature conditions. Based on microsatellite markers, we then inferred the presence of different **hybrid** classes in seasonal field samples (spring and autumn) from a site of co-occurrence over two consecutive years. All experimental **hybrid**s showed reduced fertility albeit without a specific temperature effect. Fitness was zero in one F-1 direction, but not reduced in the other. No sex ratio distortion was observed. However, fitness was reduced in all backcrosses, indicating that **hybrid**ization should be rare in the field. In the seasonal samples, C. piger was found only in autumn individuals. All 359 genotyped individuals were attributed to either of the pure species. However, several individuals of the autumn samples carried signs of later generation introgression, indicating that actual **hybrid**ization must take place recurrently during summer. We thus present evidence that seasonal environmental changes can drive **hybrid**ization dynamics and that long-term recurrent **hybrid**ization need not affect species integrity.

**Hybridization and reproductive isolation between diploid Erythronium mesochoreum and its tetraploid congener E-albidum (Liliaceae)**

Roccaforte, K; Russo, SE; Pilson, D. 2015

Polyploidy has played an important role in angiosperm diversification, but how polyploidy contributes to reproductive isolation remains poorly understood. Most work has focused on postzygotic reproductive barriers, and the influence of ploidy differences on prezygotic barriers is understudied. To address these gaps, we quantified **hybrid** occurrence, interspecific self-compatibility differences, and the contributions of multiple pre- and postzygotic barriers to reproductive isolation between diploid Erythronium mesochoreum (Liliaceae) and its tetraploid congener Erythronium albidum. Reproductive isolation between the study species was nearly complete, and naturally occurring **hybrid**s were infrequent and largely sterile. Although postzygotic barriers effected substantial reproductive isolation when considered in isolation, the study species' spatial distributions and pollinator assemblages overlapped little, such that interspecific pollen transfer is likely uncommon. We did not find evidence that E. albidum and E. mesochoreum differed in mating systems, indicating that self-incompatibility release may not have fostered speciation in this system. Ultimately, we demonstrate that E. albidum and E. mesochoreum are reproductively isolated by multiple, hierarchically-operating barriers, and we add to the currently limited number of studies demonstrating that early acting barriers such as pollinator-mediated isolation can be important for effecting and sustaining reproductive isolation in diploid-polyploid systems.

**Detection and isolation of the alpha-proteobacterium Asaia in Culex mosquitoes**

De Freece, C; Damiani, C; Valzano, M; D'Amelio, S; Cappelli, A; Ricci, I; Favia, G. 2014

Investigations of microbiota within mosquitoes continue to widen the spectrum of possible symbiont-based applications against vector-borne diseases. In this context, -proteobacteria of the genus Asaia (Rhodospirillales: Acetobacteraceae) are emerging as possible endosymbiotic candidates, particularly in paratransgenic approaches aimed at interrupting pathogen transmission. Previous studies have shown that Asaia spp. distribution among Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes displayed positive rates of infection in isolated midguts, salivary glands and reproductive tissues. Similarly, Asaia has been detected in Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta) and Aedes aegypti (Stegomyia aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) populations. Within the Culex pipiens complex (Diptera: Culicidae), Asaia infection is still largely unexplored. Here, we summarize a preliminary survey of laboratory-reared Cx.pipiens complex and field-collected Culex quinquefasciatus for the presence of Asaia spp., and present the first identification of Asaia in some of the members of the Cx.pipiens complex and the first description in West African populations of Cx.quinquefasciatus.

**Gene and species trees reveal mitochondrial and nuclear discordance in the Drosophila cardini group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)**

De Re, FC; Loreto, ELS; Robe, LJ. 2010

The Drosophila cardini group includes 15 species, which are subdivided into the D. cardini and D. dunni subgroups. Although many phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed for this group during the last five decades (based on patterns of reproductive isolation, morphology of male genitalia, chromosomal inversions, isozyme variation, or molecular sequence data), these are mostly discordant with each other. We aimed to clarify some of the evolutionary patterns related to the origin of this incongruence, while also attempting to provide a better-supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the D. cardini subgroup. For this purpose, sequences from three mitochondrial and three nuclear loci were gathered for at least eight species, and both individual gene trees and joint species tree estimates were evaluated. Although there was concordance among gene trees within each of the nuclear and mitochondrial sets, considerable incongruence was revealed in the comparisons between these two data sets. The branching position of D. neocardini was the main source of incongruence, and species trees reconstructed using different approaches with and without this species were particularly incongruent. In addition to providing a better approximation of the evolutionary history of the D. cardini group, this study suggests that incomplete lineage sorting or introgression may be biasing previous species tree estimates. More generally, the results also suggest that the use of supermatrix methods can lead to an overestimation of support for the inferred relationships, and highlight the potential effects of different taxon sampling strategies in phylogenetic reconstruction.

**Cytogenetic and molecular evidence for an additional new species within the taxon Anopheles barbirostris (Diptera: Culicidae) in Thailand**

Suwannamit, S; Baimai, V; Otsuka, Y; Saeung, A; Thongsahuan, S; Tuetun, B; Apiwathnasorn, C; Jariyapan, N; Somboon, P; Takaoka, H; Choochote, W. 2009

ITS2 DNA sequences of 42 isoline colonies of Anopheles barbirostris species A1 and A2 were analyzed and a new genetic species, temporarily designated as species A4 (Chiang Mai), was revealed. The large sequence divergences of the ITS2 (0.116-0.615), COI (0.023-0.048), and COII (0.030-0.040) genes between A. barbirostris species A4/A1 (Chiang Mai), A4/A2 (Phetchaburi), A4/A3 (Kanchanaburi), and A4/Anopheles campestris-like Form E (Chiang Mai) provided good supporting evidence. Species A1, A2, A3, and A4 share a mitotic karyotype of Form A (X-1, X-2, Y-1). Crossing experiments between species A4 and the other four species yielded strong reproductive isolation producing few and/or non-hatched eggs and inviable and/or abnormal development of the reproductive system of F-1 progenies. Moreover, available F-1 **hybrid** larvae showed asynaptic polytene chromosome arms. Hence, molecular and cytogenetic evidence strongly support the existence of A. barbirostris species A4, which is more closely related to A. campestris-like Form E than to species A1, A2, and A3. Additionally, crossing experiments among 12 and seven isolines of different cytological forms of species A1 (A, B, C, D) and A2 (A, B), respectively, yielded fertile and viable F-1 progenies. Thus, different karyotypic forms occurring in natural populations of species A1 and A2 merely represent intraspecies variation of sex chromosomes due to the extra blocks of heterochromatin.

**The influence of oviposition phenology on survival in host races of Eurosta solidaginis**

Horner, JD; Craig, TP; Itami, JK. 1999

Phenological differences between host plants can contribute to allochronic isolation of host races of phytophagous insects. Host races of the gallmaking fly, Eurosta solidaginis, that live on different species of goldenrod (Solidago altissima and S. gigantea) exhibit different emergence phenologies. These differences could result from adaptation to corresponding phenological differences between the hosts in periods of optimal suitability for gall formation and survival to adulthood. In order to test this, some flies of each host race were allowed to emerge naturally while the emergence times of others were manipulated to correspond to the emergence and oviposition periods of the other host race. Percent gall formation and survival to adulthood were examined for three oviposition periods: the peak time of emergence and oviposition of the earlier-emerging host race (that from S. gigantea), that of the later-emerging host race (that from S. altissima), and a week after the peak emergence of the host race from S. altissima. Flies of both host races were allowed to ovipuncture plants of the appropriate species during each of these periods. Plant relative growth rates were measured during each of these periods. The experiment was repeated twice over a two-year period. Relative growth rates of both host species were highest during the earliest oviposition period (the period during which the host race from S. gigantea normally emerges). Percent gall formation was significantly correlated with plant relative growth rate, but the coefficient of determination was low. In both years of the study, percent gall formation of both host races was highest during the earliest oviposition period (the period during which the host race from S. gigantea normally oviposits). Likewise, percent survival to adulthood in both host races was highest during the earliest oviposition period. There was no significant effect of oviposition period on the percent of larval death due to parasitism by Eurytoma gigantea or predation by Mordellistena unicolor. These results suggest that the host race from S. altissima does not emerge at the time that its host is optimally suited for gall formation or survival to adulthood. Therefore, differences in emergence phenologies do not appear to be due to corresponding phenological differences between the host species in suitability for gall formation or survival to adulthood.

**The First Molecular Characterization of Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) aquasalis (Diptera: Culicidae) Vitellogenin Expression Products and a Partial cDNA Sequence Isolation**

Costa-Da-Silva, AL; Lorenti, LS; Oliveira, SD; Cardoso, AF; Capurro, ML. NA

Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) aquasalis Curry, 1932, is an anopheline that plays an important role in Plasmodium transmission in the New World. Few studies have explored the molecular reproductive biology of this vector species. In the current study, we isolated and sequenced a partial, 886 bp, cDNA fragment of a vitellogenin (Vtg) gene from An. aquasalis. The transcription profile of this Vtg gene in adult females was characterized, and it is similar to other members of the Culicidae. We also detected a smaller subunit of An. aquasalis Vtg proteins in ovary tissue and characterized its translational profile in previtellogenic and vitellogenic females. Our results represent the first molecular characterization of An. aquasalis vitellogenin expression products.

**Host-associated differences in emergence pattern, reproductive behavior and life history of Asteralobia sasakii (Monzen) (Diptera : Cecidomyiidae) between populations on Ilex crenata and I. integra (Aquifoliaceae)**

Tabuchi, K; Amano, H. 2003

We assessed potential adult longevity and male choice for a mate in two populations of Asteralobia sasakii associated with Ilex crenata and I. integra to test the hypothesis that interbreeding between these populations is prevented by the difference in emergence timing in the field. A previous study showed that the last day of adult emergence on L integra and the first day of adult emergence on L crenata were separated by six to I I days. When adults were maintained in the laboratory with restricted flying, mating and oviposition, adults from both populations survived for four to five days, suggesting that the period when adults were active did not overlap between the two populations in the field. The mate choice test showed that males clearly approached females of the same host origin. These results suggest that the two populations have little chance of interbreeding even when they occur sympatrically. Other life history parameters such as the number of eggs in the ovary, daily emergence pattern, sex ratio and the duration of copulation also varied between the two populations. Our overall results strongly suggest that the two populations on different host plants can be referred to as distinct species.

**Interpopulation variation of transposable elements of the hAT superfamily in Drosophila willistoni (Diptera: Drosophilidae): in-situ approach**

Bertocchi, NA; De Oliveira, TD; Depra, M; Goni, B; Valente, VLS. 2022

Transposable elements are abundant and dynamic part of the genome, influencing organisms in different ways through their presence or mobilization, or by acting directly on pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory regions. We compared and evaluated the presence, structure, and copy number of three hAT superfamily transposons (hobo, BuT2, and mar) in five strains of Drosophila willistoni species. These D. willistoni strains are of different geographical origins, sampled across the north-south occurrence of this species. We used sequenced clones of the hAT elements in fluorescence in-situ **hybrid**izations in the polytene chromosomes of three strains of D. willistoni. We also analyzed the structural characteristics and number of copies of these hAT elements in the 10 currently available sequenced genomes of the willistoni group. We found that hobo, BuT2, and mar were widely distributed in D. willistoni polytene chromosomes and sequenced genomes of the willistoni group, except for mar, which is restricted to the subgroup willistoni. Furthermore, the elements hobo, BuT2, and mar have different evolutionary histories. The transposon differences among D. willistoni strains, such as variation in the number, structure, and chromosomal distribution of hAT transposons, could reflect the genomic and chromosomal plasticity of D. willistoni species in adapting to highly variable environments.

**Cytogenetic and molecular evidence for two species in the Anopheles barbirostris complex (Diptera : Culicidae) in Thailand**

Saeung, A; Otsuka, Y; Baimai, V; Somboon, P; Pitasawat, B; Tuetun, B; Junkum, A; Takaoka, H; Choochote, W. 2007

Seventeen isolines of Anopheles barbirostris derived from animal-biting female mosquitoes showed three karyotypic forms: Form A (X-2, Y-1) in five isolines from Phetchaburi province; Form B (X-1, X-3, Y-2) in three and eight isolines from Chiang Mai and Ubon Ratchathani provinces, respectively; Form C (X-2, Y-3) in one isoline from Phetchaburi province. All 17 isolines exhibited an average branch summation of seta 2-VI pupal skins ranging from 12.1-13.0 branches, which was in the limit of A. barbirostris (6-18 branches). Of the 12 human-biting isolines from Chiang Mai province, five isolines showed Form B (X-2, Y-2), and seven isolines exhibited a new karyotypic form designated as Form E (X-2, Y-5). All of 12 isolines had an average branch summation of seta 2-VI pupal skins ranging from 22.4-24.5 branches, which was in the limit of Anopheles campestris (17-58 branches). Thus, they were tentatively designated as A. campestris-like Forms B and E. **Hybrid**ization between A. campestris-like Forms B and E showed that they were genetically compatible, yielding viable progeny for several generations suggesting conspecific relationships of these two karyotypic forms. Reproductive isolation among crosses between A. campestris-like Form B and A. barbirostris Forms A, B, and C strongly suggested the existence of these two species. In addition, the very low intraspecific variation (genetic distance < 0.005) of the nucleotide sequence of ITS2 of the rDNA and COI and COII of mitochondrial DNA of the seven isolines of A. campestris-like Forms B and E supported their conspecific relationship. The large sequence divergence of ITS2 (0.203-0.268), COI (0.026-0.032), and COII (0.030-0.038) from genomic DNA of A. campestris-like Forms B and E and the A. barbirostris Forms A, B, and C clearly supported cytogenetic and morphological evidence.

**Rapid and repeatable shifts in life-history timing of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) following colonization of novel host plants in the Pacific Northwestern United States**

Mattsson, M; Hood, GR; Feder, JL; Ruedas, LA. 2015

Host shifts of phytophagous insect specialists to novel plants can result in divergent ecological adaptation, generating reproductive isolation and potentially new species. Rhagoletis pomonella fruit flies in eastern North America underwent a host shift similar to 160 ya from native downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to introduced, domesticated apple (Malus domestica). Divergent selection on diapause phenology related to the earlier fruiting time of apples versus downy hawthorns resulted in partial allochronic reproductive isolation between the fly races. Here, we test for how rapid and repeatable shifts in life-history timing are driving ecological divergence of R. pomonella in the Pacific Northwestern USA. The fly was introduced into the region via larval-infested apples 40-65 ya and now attacks native black hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii) and introduced ornamental hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), in addition to early-and late-maturing apple varieties in the region. To investigate the life-history timing hypothesis, we used a field-based experiment to characterize the host-associated eclosion and flight activity patterns of adults, and the feeding times of larvae at a field site in Vancouver, Washington. We also assessed the degree to which differences in host-fruiting time generate allochronic isolation among apple-, black hawthorn-, and ornamental hawthorn-associated fly populations. We conclude that host-associated fly populations are temporally offset 24.4% to 92.6% in their seasonal distributions. Our results imply that R. pomonella possesses the capacity for rapid and repeatable shifts in diapause life history to match host-fruiting phenology, which can generate ecologically based reproductive isolation, and potentially biodiversity in the process.

**Taxonomic problems in the Drosophila melanica species group (Diptera : Drosophilidae) from southern China, with special reference to karyotypes and reproductive isolation**

Wang, BC; Ohtani, K; Watabe, H; Gao, JJ; Zhang, YP. 2006

Karyotypes and reproductive isolation were studied in two allopatric populations of Drosophila tsigana, one from Guizhou Province in southern China and the other from Hokkaido in northern Japan, and in one population of a closely related species, D. longiserrata, from Guizhou. In metaphase plates of larval brain cells, both geographic strains of Drosophila tsigana showed 2n=10 chromosomes, with 2 pairs of metacentric (V-shape), 2 pairs of acrocentric (R-shape), and 1 pair of dot-liked (D-shape) chromosomes. Drosophila longiserrata showed the same number, 10 chromosomes, comprising 2V, 1J (sub-metacentric chromosome), 1 R, and 1 D. X chromosomes of both species were acrocentric, the presumed ancestral form. Premating isolation was complete between D. tsigana and D. longiserrata, and successful mating was also limited in crosses between the two geographic populations of D. tsigana, especially in crosses between Japanese (JP) females and Guizhou (GZ) males. F, **hybrid**s were obtained only from crosses between GZ females and JP males, and fertilities of both F, females and males were quite incomplete. The results of morphological observations, karyotypic analyses, and crossing experiments clearly showed that the GZ and JP populations of "D. tsigana" were highly divergent from each other and that each population should be recognized as a biologically valid species. The present morphological observations and chromosomal analyses, together with the original descriptions, strongly suggest that "Guizhou D. tsigana" might be conspecific with D. bisetata Toda, 1988 from Myanmar, and that D. Iongiserrata might be conspecific with D. afer Tan, Hsu, and Sheng, 1949 from Meitan, Guizhou.

**Male accessory gland proteins induce female monogamy in anopheline mosquitoes**

Shutt, B; Stables, L; Aboagye-Antwi, F; Moran, J; Tripet, F. 2010

The role of male accessory gland (MAG) secretions in inducing refractoriness to further mating in mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) was established in the late 1960s. In a set of simple experiments, MAG extract was injected intra-thoraxically into the hemocoel of virgin Aedes aegypti (L.), Culex pipiens pipiens (L.) and Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say females. This subsequently caused most females to remain unmated when exposed to males. For anophelines these findings were later challenged by a study involving intra-abdominal injections of MAG extracts into Anopheles gambiae Giles s.l. and Anopheles albimanus Wiedmann females, which failed to induce refractoriness to further mating. These findings led to controversy about the respective role of sperm and accessory gland peptides in inducing female monogamy in Anopheles and are at odds with our current understanding of the mating process in Drosophila spp. (Diptera: Drosophillidae) and other dipterans. Here we confirm the function of MAG secretions in anophelines experimentally by showing that intra-thoracic injections in Anopheles stephensi Liston and in the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. result in the expected female monogamy. Cross-injections of MAG extracts between the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae, two cryptic taxa within An. gambiae s.s. which are thought to be undergoing incipient speciation, also elicited effective refractoriness, suggesting that the two sub-taxa have not diverged with regard to sex peptides responsible for female monogamy. Importantly, this also suggests that the rare cases of re-mating following cross-mating observed in this species may not be a form of reproductive barrier between molecular forms.

**Gene flow and genetic structure of Bactrocera carambolae (Diptera, Tephritidae) among geographical differences and sister species, B-dorsalis, inferred from microsatellite DNA data**

Aketarawong, N; Isasawin, S; Sojikul, P; Thanaphum, S. 2015

The Carambola fruit fly, Bactrocera carambolae, is an invasive pest in Southeast Asia. It has been introduced into areas in South America such as Suriname and Brazil. Bactrocera carambolae belongs to the B. dorsalis species complex, and seems to be separated from B. dorsalis based on morphological and multilocus phylogenetic studies. Even though the Carambola fruit fly is an important quarantine species and has an impact on international trade, knowledge of the molecular ecology of B. carambolae, concerning species status and pest management aspects, is lacking. Seven populations sampled from the known geographical areas of B. carambolae including Southeast Asia (i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) and South America (i.e., Suriname), were genotyped using eight microsatellite DNA markers. Genetic variation, genetic structure, and genetic network among populations illustrated that the Suriname samples were genetically differentiated from Southeast Asian populations. The genetic network revealed that samples from West Sumatra (Pekanbaru, PK) and Java (Jakarta, JK) were presumably the source populations of B. carambolae in Suriname, which was congruent with human migration records between the two continents. Additionally, three populations of B. dorsalis were included to better understand the species boundary. The genetic structure between the two species was significantly separated and approximately 11% of total individuals were detected as admixed (0.100 <= Q <= 0.900). The genetic network showed connections between B. carambolae and B. dorsalis groups throughout Depok (DP), JK, and Nakhon Sri Thammarat (NT) populations. These data supported the hypothesis that the reproductive isolation between the two species may be leaky. Although the morphology and monophyly of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences in previous studies showed discrete entities, the hypothesis of semipermeable boundaries may not be rejected. Alleles at microsatellite loci could be introgressed rather than other nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Bactrocera carambolae may be an incipient rather than a distinct species of B. dorsalis. Regarding the pest management aspect, the genetic sexing Salaya5 strain (SY5) was included for comparison with wild populations. The SY5 strain was genetically assigned to the B. carambolae cluster. Likewise, the genetic network showed that the strain shared greatest genetic similarity to JK, suggesting that SY5 did not divert away from its original genetic makeup. Under laboratory conditions, at least 12 generations apart, selection did not strongly affect genetic compatibility between the strain and wild populations. This knowledge further confirms the potential utilization of the Salaya5 strain in regional programs of area-wide integrated pest management using SIT.

**Geographical variations of odour and pollinators, and test for local adaptation by reciprocal transplant of two European Arum species**

Chartier, M; Pelozuelo, L; Buatois, B; Bessiere, JM; Gibernau, M. 2013

1. Interactions between entomophilous plants and their pollinators are one of the major factors shaping the evolution of floral features. As species are distributed in more or less connected populations, they have evolved in a geographical mosaic of co-evolution were the outcome of the plant-pollinator interaction is likely to vary as a result of local adaptations. 2. Arum italicum and Arum maculatum are two species of Araceae which deceive their fly pollinators by mimicking the odour of their oviposition sites. Whereas A.italicum is known to be pollinated by flies belonging to different families (i.e. opportunist), A.maculatum relies on only two pollinating species of the family Psychodidae throughout its European repartition area (i.e. specialist). 3. The interannual and geographical variations of pollinators and pollinator-attractive odours were described in several populations of the two species over two consecutive years. Furthermore, local adaptation to pollinators was tested by transplanting inflorescence-bearing plants between two different sites and by recording the number and composition of the insect fauna trapped inside the inflorescences during anthesis as a measure of a fitness component. 4. Pollinators and pollinator-attractive odours of the two Arum species varied in time and space, but there was no clear odour structure between populations. When transplanted, inflorescences of both species trapped the same composition and number of insects as native inflorescences at a given site; this indicates that pollinator composition is highly dependent on the local availability of insects. 5. No pattern of local adaptation was found for these two species, but local pollination conditions were shown to strongly affect the degree of geographical variations of these interactions. The lack of a clear odour geographical structure might be due to high gene flow or to similar selective pressures exerted by pollinators, and the high interindividual odour variation may be linked to the deceptive strategy adopted by the two plant species.

**The speciation continuum: Population structure, gene flow, and maternal ancestry in the Simulium arcticum complex (Diptera: Simuliidae)**

Conflitti, IM; Shields, GF; Murphy, RW; Currie, DC. NA

Comparative analyses of populations at different stages of divergence can yield insights into the process of speciation. We assess population structure, gene flow, and maternal ancestry at five locations containing sympatric members of the Simulium arcticum complex at different stages of chromosome divergence. We analyze both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers, including 11 microsatellite loci, as well as COI, COII, cytb, and ND4 gene sequences. Simulium negativum, representing the later stages of divergence, shows both nuclear and mitochondrial differentiation when compared with allopatric and sympatric chromosomal forms, as well as both low contemporary and historical gene flow in sympatry. At intermediate stages of chromosome divergence, populations differ at nuclear, but not mitochondrial, loci in allopatry and sympatry. In one comparison of intermediate stage chromosomal forms (S. arcticum sensu stricto and S. apricarium), populations demonstrate low contemporary, but higher historical, gene flow in sympatry. In a second sympatric comparison (S. arcticum s. s. and S. brevicercum), both contemporary and historical gene flow are high. All analyses of sympatric populations at the earliest stages of chromosome divergence demonstrate panmixia; yet, some nuclear differentiation in allopatry is apparent. These findings suggest that molecular divergence is tracking chromosome divergence along a chromosomally-defined continuum of speciation in black flies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

**The period gene and allochronic reproductive isolation in Bactrocera cucurbitae**

Miyatake, T; Matsumoto, A; Matsuyama, T; Ueda, HR; Toyosato, T; Tanimura, T. 2002

Clock genes that pleiotropically control circadian rhythm and the time of mating may cause allochronic reproductive isolation in the melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Flies with a shorter circadian period (ca. 22 h of locomotor activity rhythm) mated 5 h earlier in the day than those with a longer circadian period (ca. 30 h). Mate-choice tests demonstrated significant pre-mating isolation between populations with short and long circadian periods. Pre-mating isolation did not occur when the mating time was synchronized between the two populations by photoperiodic controls, indicating that reproductive isolation is due to variations in the time of mating and not any unidentified ethological difference between the two populations. We cloned the period (per) gene of B. cucurbitae that is homologous to the per gene in Drosophila. The relative level of per mRNA in the melon fly exhibited a robust daily fluctuation under light : dark conditions. The fluctuation of per expression under dark : dark conditions is closely correlated to the locomotor rhythm in B. cucurbitae. These results suggest that clock genes can cause reproductive isolation via the pleiotropic effect as a change of mating time.

**PHYLOGENETICALLY DISTANT SYMBIOTIC MICROORGANISMS RESIDE IN GLOSSINA MIDGUT AND OVARY TISSUES**

ONEILL, SL; GOODING, RH; AKSOY, S. 1993

Many blood-feeding insects, including tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae), harbour intracellular bacterial symbionts. Using isolates from tissues of several Glossina species and diagnostic DNA oligonucleotide primers, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay was designed to identify symbiotic bacteria. Those inhabiting the midgut of Glossina were found to belong to the gamma subdivision, whereas ovarian Proteobacteria were of the alpha subdivision - probably genus Wolbachia (Rickettsiaceae). The presence of Wolbachia-like Rickettsia in the ovaries of G.morsitans subspecies may help to explain the maternally inherited incompatibility of some crosses within this species.

**Population cytogenetic and molecular evidence for existence of a new species in Anopheles fluviatilis complex (Diptera: Culicidae)**

Nanda, N; Singh, OP; Dua, VK; Pandey, AC; Nagpal, BN; Adak, T; Dash, AP; Subbarao, SK. 2013

Anopheles fluviatilis James, an important malaria vector in the Oriental region has been established as a complex of at least three cryptic species which vary in their biological characteristics and malaria transmission potential. The sibling species S, T and U of Fluviatilis Complex can be identified by examination of species-specific fixed inversions in the polytene chromosomes and can also be differentiated by an allele-specific PCR assay based on differences in the D3 region of 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of these species. Here we report a new An. fluviatilis population from villages under Laksar Community Health Centre, District Haridwar (Uttarakhand state), India which differs from the three sibling species of Fluviatilis Complex by two fixed paracentric inversions, s(1) and S in polytene chromosome arms 2 and 3 respectively. Longitudinal study carried out in study villages showed that the new cytotype was sympatric with species T and U in all the collections and no inversion heterozygotes were observed between them. Thus presence of two fixed paracentric inversions in polytene chromosomes with total absence of inversion heterozygotes demonstrates reproductive isolation which unequivocally establishes this cytological variant as a new species, provisionally designated as species V in the Fluviatilis Complex. Analysis of DNA sequences of 133 domain of 28S rDNA and ITS 2 region has also shown that species V is distinctly different from species S, T and U. With the discovery of new species in the Fluviatilis Complex, in-depth studies are required to know its distribution pattern and biological characteristics and to ascertain its role in malaria transmission.

**Kelp flies and species concepts - the case of Coelopa frigida (Fabricius, 1805) and C-nebularum Aldrich, 1929 (Diptera : Coelopidae)**

Laamanen, TR; Petersen, FT; Meier, R. 2003

The beaches of the North Atlantic and North Pacific are home to kelp flies of the Coelopa frigida/nebularum complex, which consists of one to three different species depending on whether the two nominal species are accepted and a cryptic species proposed by Remmert is counted. The morphological differences between two populations of C. frigida (Fabricius, 1805) from the North Sea and the Baltic Region and two populations of C. nebularum Aldrich, 1929 from Alaska and Japan are described and discussed for small, medium, and large specimens. Crossing experiments are used to demonstrate that, under laboratory conditions, no isolation mechanisms between either population exist. Coelopa frigida and C. nebularum are therefore regarded as a single biological species, a conclusion that is congruent with the observation that the genetic distances based on Ef 1-alpha and 16S rDNA indicate lower levels of differentiation within C. frigida/nebularum than between undisputed Coelopa species. The substantial morphological, breeding and genetic information on the C. frigida/nebularum species complex is then applied to six different species concepts popular in the modern systematic literature. According to the Biological, Hennigian and Recognition Species Concepts, only a single species would be recognized. The Evolutionary Species Concept is too vague to be applicable and under two variants of the Phylogenetic Species Concept, C. frigida and C. nebularum would constitute separate species. This result confirms that Phylogenetic Species Concepts lead to a higher species number than concepts based on reproductive isolation. Practical and theoretical problems with the various species concepts are briefly discussed.

**Molecular Systematics and Origin of the Mediterranean Sea Rock-Pool Mosquitoes of the Aedes mariae (Diptera: Culicidae) Complex**

Mastrantonio, V; Porretta, D; Bellini, R; Nascetti, G; Urbanelli, S. 2015

Mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes mariae complex, including Aedes mariae (Sergent & Sergent), Aedes zammitii (Theobald), and Aedes phoeniciae (Coluzzi & Sabatini), are among the few animals inhabiting the extreme habitat of sea rock pools. Morphological analysis of these species and crossing experiments conducted in laboratory and natural conditions inferred the occurrence of three taxa with a parapatric distribution along the coasts of the Mediterranean Basin. To date, however, genetic characterization of the three species within the Ae. mariae complex and an assessment of their interspecific differentiation are lacking. In this study, we used both nuclear (i.e., 14 allozymic loci) and mitochondrial genetic markers (i.e., sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I and II genes) to genetically characterize the three species belonging to the complex. Then, we used mitochondrial markers to infer phylogenetic relationships between the species and estimate the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). The allozymic and mitochondrial markers showed the occurrence of three distinct gene pools, namely, Ae. mariae, Ae. zammitii, and Ae. phoeniciae. The TMRCAs for the entire in-group were estimated to have occurred during the early Pleistocene (i.e., mean node age of 1.739 million years ago). An important role of Pleistocene climatic changes could be suggested in the origin of the species of the Ae. mariae complex and in shaping their pattern of intraspecific genetic diversity.

**Analysis of the activity patterns of two sympatric sandfly siblings of the Lutzomyia longipalpis species complex from Brazil**

Rivas, GBS; Souza, NA; Peixoto, AA. 2008

Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. (Lutz & Neiva) (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Latin America. Differences in copulation songs, pheromones and molecular markers show that L. longipalpis is a species complex in Brazil. The patterns of activity of insect vectors are important in disease transmission. In addition. differences in activity rhythms have a potential role as a temporal reproductive isolation mechanism in closely related species. We compared the activity patterns of males and females of two sympatric species of the Longipalpis complex from Sobral (Ceara State, Brazil) in controlled laboratory conditions. We observed small but significant differences between the two species in the activity phase in both mates and females.

**Evidence of Adaptive Evolution and Relaxed Constraints in Sex-Biased Genes of South American and West Indies Fruit Flies (Diptera: Tephritidae)**

Congrains, C; Campanini, EB; Torres, FR; Rezende, VB; Nakamura, AM; de Oliveira, JL; Lima, ALA; Chahad-Ehlers, S; Sobrinho, IS; de Brito, RA. 2018

Several studies have demonstrated that genes differentially expressed between sexes (sex-biased genes) tend to evolve faster than unbiased genes, particularly in males. The reason for this accelerated evolution is not clear, but several explanations have involved adaptive and nonadaptive mechanisms. Furthermore, the differences of sex-biased expression patterns of closely related species are also little explored out of Drosophila. To address the evolutionary processes involved with sex biased expression in species with incipient differentiation, we analyzed male and female transcriptomes of Anastrepha fraterculus and Anastrepha obliqua, a pair of species that have diverged recently, likely in the presence of gene flow. Using these data, we inferred differentiation indexes and evolutionary rates and tested for signals of selection in thousands of genes expressed in head and reproductive transcriptomes from both species. Our results indicate that sex-biased and reproductive-biased genes evolve faster than unbiased genes in both species, which is due to both adaptive pressure and relaxed constraints. Furthermore, among male-biased genes evolving under positive selection, we identified some related to sexual functions such as courtship behavior and fertility. These findings suggest that sex-biased genes may have played important roles in the establishment of reproductive isolation between these species, due to a combination of selection and drift, and unveil a plethora of genetic markers useful for more studies in these species and their differentiation.

**Rapid Loss of Resistance to Satyrization in Invasive Mosquitoes and the Effects of Age on Interspecific Mating Frequency**

Bargielowski, I; Honorio, NA; Blosser, EM; Lounibos, LP. 2019

In several areas where Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) have come in contact following successful invasions, Ae. aegypti have been rapidly displaced by Ae. albopictus. Recent work has confirmed that mating interference, in the form of satyrization, is likely a driving factor in these competitive displacements. However, in sites of sympatry, Ae. aegypti females evolve resistance to satyrization, and in the laboratory, satyrization-susceptible Ae. aegypti can evolve resistance within a few generations of cage exposure to Ae. albopictus. The resistance trait may be costly to maintain, as satyrization-resistant females have been shown to invest more time in mate selection. Here, we show that increased satyrization-resistance does not persist in the absence of satyrization pressure, confirming a cost to maintaining this trait. Ae. aegypti lines that had been previously selected for increased satyrization-resistance demonstrated rapid decreases in this trait over eight generations. Support for the hypothesis that condition-dependent mate preferences lead to variation in mating choice among individuals of differing quality within a population has been accumulating. Here we examine how age-related changes in reproductive effort or reproductive value may result in age-dependent mate choice. We hypothesize that older, lower quality individuals may be more likely to accept a subpar mating, in this case an interspecific mating. Our results demonstrate that mosquito age significantly affects interspecific mating rates with older mosquitoes (male and female) engaging in interspecific mating more frequently than younger counterparts (26.32 vs 9.41%). We discuss the possibility of age-related signal variation causing the breakdown of mating barriers with age.

**Effects of Female fruit-marking Pheromones on Oviposition, Mating, and Male Behavior in the Neotropical Species Rhagoletis conversa Brethes and Rhagoletis brncici Frias (Diptera: Tephritidae)**

Frias-Lasserre, D. 2015

Sex pheromones produced by females of Rhagoletis conversa Br,thes and Rhagoletis brncici Frias are deposited on the surface of fruits after the eggs are laid. These pheromones repel other females, preventing repeated oviposition on the same fruit. They also attract males, thus assisting mating. Observations were made on wild populations, and cross-species behavioral tests were performed on males. The pheromone released by females was significantly more attractive for males of the same species. The two species showed remarkable differences in mating behavior, in the duration of oviposition, and in the number of circuits made around the fruit after eggs were laid. A morphological analysis of flies collected from their respective host plants indicated great host fidelity and the reproductive isolation of the two species. Possibly, the specific male-arresting effect of this pheromone was important for the sympatric speciation and evolution of these sibling species.

**Experimental hybridization and reproductive isolation between two sympatric species of tephritid fruit flies in the Anastrepha fraterculus species group**

Rull, J; Tadeo, E; Lasa, R; Rodriguez, CL; Altuzar-Molina, A; Aluja, M. 2018

Among tephritid fruit flies, **hybrid**ization has been found to produce local adaptation and speciation, and in the case of pest species, induce behavioral and ecological alterations that can adversely impact efficient pest management. The fraterculus species group within Anastrepha (Diptera: Tephritidae), is a rapidly radiating aggregate, which includes cryptic species complexes, numerous sister species, and several pest species. Molecular studies have highlighted the possibility of introgression between A. fraterculus and A. obliqua. Reproductive isolation has been studied among morphotypes of the A. fraterculus species complex as a tool for species delimitation. Here we examined the existence and strength of prezygotic and postzygotic isolation between sympatric populations of two closely related species within the highly derived fraterculus group (A. fraterculus and A. obliqua), coexisting in nature. Although adults of both species showed a strong tendency for assortative mating, a small proportion of **hybrid** pairings in both directions were observed. We also observed asymmetric postzygotic isolation, with one **hybrid** cross displaying a strong reduction in fecundity and F1 egg fertility. Survival was greater for the progeny of homotypic and **hybrid** crosses in the maternal host. There was a marked female biased sex ratio distortion for both F1 **hybrid** adults. **Hybrid**ization between A. fraterculus and A. obliqua in nature may be difficult but possible; these two species display stronger reproductive isolation than all pairs of species previously examined in the A. fraterculus species complex. Asymmetric postzygotic isolation is suggestive of Wolbachia mediated cytoplasmic incompatibilities that may be exploited in area-wide pest management.

**Sexual Isolation Between Two Known Intraspecific Populations of Hartigiola (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) That Induce Leaf Galls on Upper and Lower Surfaces of Fagus crenata (Fagales: Fagaceae), Indicating Possible Diversification Into Sibling Species**

Mishima, M; Sato, S; Tsuda, K; Yukawa, J. 2014

Hartigiola faggalli (Monzen), a cecidomyiid species that induces leaf galls on Fagus crenata Blume (Fagales: Fagaceae), was studied to assess the degree of sexual isolation between known intraspeci_c populations derived from two different gall types. "Upper- type galls" form on the lateral veins of upper leaf surfaces, whereas "lower- type galls" develop between the lateral veins of lower leaf surfaces. The two populations were distinguished based on slight differences in theirDNAsequences. They coexisted in F. crenata forests. Emergence, swarming, mating, and oviposition occurred sequentially each day and almost simultaneously in both populations. Thus, they were not isolated from each other in time or space. However, 85% of 134 swarming males flew to females of the same population when responding to female sex pheromone. About 92% of 251 mating pairs were homogenic, and I PSI indicated a signi_cantly homogenic mating. The female sex pheromone and male sensitivity to the pheromone seemed to differ between the two populations. After mating, females of each population oviposited their eggs only on either the upper or lower surfaces of fresh leaves. The strongly assortative mating combined with differences in pheromones and gall morphology indicates that the two populations are almost completely reproductively isolated and that they have diversi_ed into the stage of sibling species.

**CYTOLOGICAL AND ISOENZYME ANALYSIS OF THE BUCAY AND QUEVEDO CYTOTYPES OF THE ONCHOCERCIASIS VECTOR SIMULIUM-EXIGUUM (DIPTERA, SIMULIIDAE) IN ECUADOR**

CHARALAMBOUS, M; READY, PD; SHELLEY, AJ; ARZUBE, M; LOWRY, CA. 1993

Four cytotypes of Simulium exiguum occur in Ecuador, where this morphospecies is the primary vector of onchocerciasis. In this paper, we give the first full description of the banding pattern of the larval polytene chromosomes of the Quevedo cytotype and assess its degree of genetic separation from the Bucay cytotype. Both cytotypes differ from the chromosomal standard sequence (of the Cayapa cytotype) by the fixed inversions IIL-5 and IIL-6. The Quevedo cytotype additionally differs from the standard and Bucay cytotypes by possessing a differentiated X chromosome, which is indicated by the inversion IIS-A. As the degree of reproductive isolation between the Bucay and Quevedo cytotypes has not yet been established, they must be regarded as intraspecific variants of the same species. In fact, isoenzyme characterizations showed that the Bucay and Quevedo cytotypes are differentiated only to the extent expected of incipient species or geographical populations. Moreover, the sibling species status previously given to the Bucay cytotype needs be reassessed, there being inadequate analysis from areas in Ecuador where Bucay occurs in sympatry with the standard Cayapa cytotype. No isoenzyme electromorphs were discovered that identified all or most adult females of any one (cytotype-pure) collection.

**Reproductive compatibility among Mexican populations of Anastrepha obliqua: theoretical and management implications**

Rull, J; Tadeo, E; Lasa, R; Diaz-Fleischer, F; Arredondo, J; Aluja, M. 2018

The fraterculus species group, composed of 34 species in the genus Anastrepha (Diptera: Tephritidae), includes the fraterculus cryptic species complex formed by eight reproductively isolated morphotypes. A previous study revealed six genetic mitochondrial types of Anastrepha obliqua, suggesting the existence of a second cryptic species complex. However, marked discrepancies between nuclear and mitochondrial loci rather suggest incomplete lineage sorting or introgression between A.obliqua and A.fraterculus. Such **hybrid**ization could nevertheless result in reproductive isolation, an outcome that could affect efficacy of area-wide management for the most important pest of mangos in America. Two mitochondrial types occur in Mexico, and the limits of a third one, encompassing Central American populations, have not been clearly established. Here, we tested reproductive compatibility among three A.obliqua populations from the Pacific and a population from the Gulf of Mexico. No evidence of pre-zygotic isolation was found. Flies from the Atlantic mated randomly for equal duration with individuals from three Pacific populations. Homotypic and heterotypic crosses produced similar numbers of eggs, with heterotypic crosses of Pacific males and Atlantic females hatching in lower proportions. Larvae of all cross types developed equally in mangos and exhibited no sex ratio distortion of **hybrid** F1. The three mitochondrial types identified in Mexico and Central America do not appear to be cryptic species and can be managed using one single strain for the sterile insect technique.

**Genetic identification of two sibling species of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera : Psychodidae) that produce distinct male sex pheromones in Sobral, Ceara State, Brazil**

Maingon, RDC; Ward, RD; Hamilton, JGC; Noyes, HA; Souza, N; Kemp, SJ; Watts, PC. 2003

Lutzomyia longipalpis , the main sandfly vector for New World visceral leishmaniasis is a complex of an as yet undefined number of sibling species. At present, there is no consensus on the status (single species vs. species complex) of Brazilian populations. We applied five microsatellite loci to test the hypothesis that L. longipalpis occurs as two sympatric cryptic species in Sobral, Ceara State, Brazil as predicted by male sex pheromone chemotypes described previously for field specimens from this site [S-9-methyl-germacrene-B (9MGB) and a cembrene compound]. Abdominal spot morphology corresponds with pheromone type at this locality (9MGB in '1 spot' males and cembrene in '2 spot' males). Genotype data from 190 wild-caught L. longipalpis specimens collected in October 1999 and April 2001 were used to estimate genetic differentiation between the two sex pheromone populations and sampling dates. No significant (P > 0.05) genetic differences were found between the 1999 and 2001 9MGB samples (theta = 0.018; R-ST = -0. 005), and genetic differentiation was low between the cembrene collections (theta = 0.037, P < 0.05; R-ST = -0.043, P > 0.05). By contrast, highly divergent allelic frequencies (largely at two microsatellite loci) corresponded to significant (P > 0.05) genetic differentiation (theta = 0.221; R-ST = 0.215) for all comparisons between samples with different pheromones. When pheromone samples were pooled across sample date, genetic differentiation was high (theta = 0.229; P < 0.001; N-e m = 0.84). The allele frequency distribution at each of the five microsatellite loci was similar for males and females from the two collection years. Two of these loci showed highly divergent allele frequencies in the two sex pheromone populations. This was reflected in the highly significant genetic differentiation obtained from the male genotypes, between populations producing different pheromones (theta = 0.229-0.268; P < 0.0001 for the 2001 and theta = 0.254-0.558; P < 0.0001 for the 1999 collections, respectively). Similar results were obtained when the females, assigned to a pheromone type, were included in the analysis. Both a Bayesian analysis of the data set and a population assignment test provided strong evidence for two distinct populations corresponding to pheromone type. Given its genotype, the probability of assigning a 9MGB male to the original 9MGB population was 100% once the two years' collections were pooled. For cembrene-producing '2 spot' males this probability although still high, was lower than for 9MGB males, at 86%. This microsatellite data together with previously reported reproductive isolation between the two Sobral populations confirm that premating barriers are important in speciation of L. longipalpis.

**Differences in sperm storage and remating propensity between adult females of two morphotypes of the Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) cryptic species complex**

Abraham, S; Rull, J; Mendoza, M; Liendo, MC; Devescovi, F; Roriz, AK; Kovaleski, A; Segura, DF; Vera, MT. 2014

The South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus, is a complex of cryptic species composed of at least seven morphotypes. Some of them, such as the Peruvian and Brazilian 1 morphotypes (which include Argentinean populations), exhibit strong pre-copulatory isolation, yet it is possible to obtain heterotypic crosses when forcing copulation of adults under laboratory conditions. The cross involving Peruvian males and Argentinean females produces F1 offspring with reduced viability in terms of egg hatch. This low hatchability could be caused by a reduced amount of sperm transferred to and stored by females mated with heterotypic males, which in turn could affect their post-copulatory behaviour. To test these hypotheses, we investigated sperm transfer and female mating and remating behaviour for homotypic and heterotypic crosses between adults of two morphotypes (Brazilian 1 [Argentina] and Peruvian [Peru]) of the A. fraterculus cryptic species complex. As reported before, Argentinean males and females mated earlier in the day than the other three mating combinations. Peruvian females engaged in shorter copulation times than Argentinean females. Peruvian females tended to store smaller quantities of sperm than Argentinean females, and almost a half of the crosses involving Argentinean males and Peruvian females were unsuccessful (no sperm transfer). However, there was no evidence that the cross between Peruvian males and Argentinean females resulted in storage of a critically small amount of sperm (posing risk of sperm shortage). Argentinean females were more willing to remate than Peruvian females, irrespective of male morphotype, but latency to remating was not affected by male or female morphotype. This study shows that mating behaviour differs between some of the A. fraterculus complex morphotypes, with female but not male morphotype determining female likelihood to remate.

**Cryptic Species of the Anastrepha fraterculus Complex (Diptera: Tephritidae): A Multivariate Approach for the Recognition of South American Morphotypes**

Hernandez-Ortiz, V; Bartolucci, AF; Morales-Valles, P; Frias, D; Selivon, D. 2012

Although a large amount of data have been published in past years on the taxonomic status of the Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) species complex, there is still a need to know how many species this complex comprises, the distribution of each one, and their distinguishing features. In this study, we assessed the morphometric variability of 32 populations from the A. fraterculus complex, located in major biogeographical areas from the Neotropics. Multivariate techniques for analysis were applied to the measurements of 21 variables referring to the mesonotum, aculeus, and wing. For the first time, our results identified the presence of seven distinct morphotypes within this species complex. According to the biogeographical areas, populations occurring in the Mesoamerican dominion (Mexico, Guatemala, and Panama) were clustered within a single natural entity labeled as the "Mexican" morphotype; whereas in the northwestern South American dominion, samples fell into three distinct groups: the "Venezuelan" morphotype with a single population from the Caribbean lowlands of Venezuela, the "Andean" morphotype from the highlands of Venezuela and Colombia, and the third group or "Peruvian" morphotype comprised the samples from the Pacific coastal lowlands of Ecuador and Peru. Three additional groups were identified from the Chacoan and Paranaense sub-regions: the morphotype "Brazilian-1" was recognized as including the Argentinean samples with most pertaining to Brazil, and widely distributed in these biogeographical areas; the morphotype "Brazilian-2" was recognized as including two samples from the state of Sao Paulo (Ilha-Bela and Sao Sebastiao); whereas the morphotype "Brazilian-3" included a single population from Botucatu (state of Sao Paulo). Based on data published by previous authors showing genetic and karyotypic differentiation, as well as reproductive isolation, we have concluded that such morphotypes indeed represent natural groups and distinct taxonomic entities.

**EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE TRANSMISSION OF WESTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS AND ST-LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS VIRUSES BY CULEX-TARSALIS (DIPTERA, CULICIDAE)**

REISEN, WK; MEYER, RP; PRESSER, SB; HARDY, JL. 1993

The extrinsic incubation rate (inverse of the time in days from infection to median transmission) of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses by laboratory strains of Culex tarsalis Coquillett increased as a linear function of incubation temperatures from 10 to 30-degrees-C. The estimated temperatures for zero transmission thresholds (intercept of the X axis) were 10.9 and 14.9-degrees-C, and the number of degree days above these thresholds required for median transmission (inverse of the slope) was 67.6 and 115.2, respectively. Although the bodies of most Cx. tarsalis females remained infected and the WEE viral titer did not decrease significantly throughout the incubation periods at all temperatures, transmission rates by females incubated at 20 to 30-degrees-C decreased markedly after peaking at 7-10 d after infection. In contrast, midgut escape and salivary gland infection barriers limited the transmission rates of SLE virus at all temperatures, but these rates did not decrease markedly as a function of incubation time, indicating that virus modulation did not occur. Degree-day models were used to calculate monthly changes in the duration of the extrinsic incubation period for WEE and SLE viruses in the San joaquin and Coachella valleys based on mosquito temperatures estimated by combining nocturnal air and diurnal resting site temperatures. Temperatures in the San joaquin Valley averaged 5-degrees-C cooler than in the Coachella Valley, proportionately shortening the duration of the potential transmission season for WEE virus from 10 to 8 mo and for SLE virus from 8 to 5 mo, respectively.

**Courtship song genes and speciation in sand files**

Oliveira, SG; Bottecchia, M; Bauzer, LGSR; Souza, NA; Ward, RD; Kyriacou, CP; Peixoto, AA. 2001

Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) is a vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas and it might represent a complex of sibling species. Reproductive isolation between closely related species often involves differences in courtship behaviour. cacophony (cac) and period (per) are two Drosophila genes that control features of the "lovesong" males produce during courtship that has been implicated in the sexual isolation between closely related species. We are ruing gene fragments from L. longipalpis' homologues of these two genes to study the speciation process in this putative species complex.

**INTRASPECIFIC AND INTERSPECIFIC SEX-PHEROMONE RESPONSES OF SCREWWORM AND SECONDARY SCREWWORM FLIES**

HAMMACK, L. 1992

A laboratory behavioral assay examined intra- and interspecific responses to sex pheromone by screwworms, Cochliomyia hominivorax, and secondary screwworms, C. macellaria, in relation to the duration of colonization of C hominivorax test males. Females of C macellaria, like those of C hominivorax, were found to produce a pheromone that stimulates male copulatory attempts on contact. Newly colonized (< 22 generations) C hominivorax males did not respond to C macellaria pheromone, indicating that pheromone contributes to reproductive isolation between these two closely related species. Although long-colonized (> 200 generations) C hominivorax males did respond to C macellaria females or their extract, this behavior was infrequent and significantly less common than intraspecific responses. Depriving C macellaria adults of dietary protein did not affect the potency of female extracts, but did reduce male responsiveness to pheromone. These results provided little evidence that colonization reduces the ability of C hominivorax males to differentiate between C hominivorax and C macellaria females using sex pheromones.

**Cryptic species of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) at high elevations in the Oriental Region: The Simulium vernum species group in Thailand**

Adler, PH; Srisuka, W; Saeung, A. 2020

High-mountain summits in tropical regions are habitat islands that provide refugia for northern taxa and opportunities for speciation. These focal hotspots of biodiversity are also threatened by increasing anthropogenic pressures and changing climatic conditions. The largest species group of black flies, the Simulium vernum group, reaches its southern limit in the mountains of Southeast Asia, providing an opportunity to examine macrogenetic diversification at the southern edge of the group's range. We investigated the polytene chromosomes of two morphologically similar species in the S. vernum group, S. chomthongense Takaoka, Srisuka & Choochote, and S. khunklangense Takaoka & Srisuka, from their type localities near the summit of Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest mountain. Chromosomal analyses of 112 larvae demonstrated reproductive isolation between S. chomthongense and S. khunklangense and revealed a cryptic species of S. chomthongense. The three species have the same fixed banding sequence in five of the six chromosome arms, but they are distinguished by the successive addition of overlapping inversions in the IIIL arm. The two cytospecies (A and B) of S. chomthongense s. l. are the third example of endemic or nearly endemic cryptic species pairs near the top of Doi Inthanon, suggesting the possibility of sympatric speciation and the importance of conserving high-elevation stream habitats.

**Behavioural mechanisms of reproductive isolation between two hybridizing dung fly species**

Giesen, A; Blanckenhorn, WU; Schafer, MA. 2017

Characterization of the phenotypic differentiation and genetic basis of traits that can contribute to reproductive isolation is an important avenue to understand the mechanisms of speciation. We quantified the degree of prezygotic isolation and geographical variation in mating behaviour among four populations of Sepsis neocynipsea that occur in allopatry, parapatry or sympatry with four populations of its sister species Sepsis cynipsea. To obtain insights into the quantitative genetic basis and the role of selection against **hybrid** phenotypes we also investigated mating behaviour of F-1 **hybrid** offspring and corresponding backcrosses with the parental populations. Our study documents successful **hybrid**ization under laboratory conditions, with low copulation frequencies in heterospecific pairings but higher frequencies in pairings of F-1 **hybrid**s signifying **hybrid** vigour. Analyses of F-1 offspring and their parental backcrosses provided little evidence for sexual selection against **hybrid**s. Longer copulation latencies in heterospecific pairings indicate species recognition, probably due to surface or volatile chemicals. The frequency of male mating attempts did not differ greatly between species or **hybrid** pairings, suggesting no male discrimination of mating partners. Female shaking duration, signifying female choice and/or reluctance to mate, differed strongly between the species and appears to contribute to avoiding heterospecific males; this trait is partially maternal inherited. Importantly, females of both species discriminated more strongly against males in areas of sympatry than allopatry indicating reinforcement. Shorter copulations in heterospecific parental pairings and longer copulations in F-1 **hybrid**s suggest mechanistic difficulties with sperm transfer. Overall, our study highlights an important role of character displacement affecting mating behaviour of **hybrid**izing sepsid species in geographical areas of coexistence.

**Behavioural, ecological and genetic evidence confirm the occurrence of host-associated differentiation in goldenrod gall-midges**

Dorchin, N; Scott, ER; Clarkin, CE; Luongo, MP; Jordan, S; Abrahamson, WG. 2009

Host-associated differentiation (HAD) is considered a step towards ecological speciation and an important mechanism promoting diversification in phytophagous insects. Although the number of documented cases of HAD is increasing, these still represent only a small fraction of species and feeding guilds among phytophagous insects, and most reports are based on a single type of evidence. Here we employ a comprehensive approach to present behavioural, morphological, ecological and genetic evidence for the occurrence of HAD in the gall midge Dasineura folliculi (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on two sympatric species of goldenrods (Solidago rugosa and S. gigantea). Controlled experiments revealed assortative mating and strong oviposition fidelity for the natal-host species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed an amount of genetic divergence between the two host-associated populations compatible with cryptic species rather than host races. Lower levels of within-host genetic divergence, gall development and natural-enemy attack in the S. gigantea population suggest this is the derived host.

**Pleiotropic effect, clock genes, and reproductive isolation**

Miyatake, T. 2002

The mechanism by which a clock gene pleiotropically controlling life history and behavioral traits causes reproductive isolation is explained using a model species, the melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Melon flies mate once a day, at dusk. The population selected for life history traits exhibits correlated responses in the time of mating during the day. For example, the fly populations selected for faster (slower) development have an earlier (later) time of mating. A circathan rhythm controls the time of mating. The circadian periods in constant darkness were about 22h in lines selected for a short developmental period and about 31 h in lines selected for a long developmental period. The data on crosses between the selected lines indicated that the developmental period is controlled by a polygene, whereas the circadian period may be controlled by a single clock gene. These results suggest a clock gene pleiotropically controls developmental and circadian periods in the melon fly. Reproductive isolation may often evolve as an indirect (pleiotropic) consequence of adaptation to different environments or habitats. For example, niches that are temporally or seasonally offset can select organisms with different developmental characteristics. These developmennt differences can inadvertently cause reproductive isolation by a variety of means including shifts in mating activity patterns. The difference in time of mating between populations selected for developmental period translated into significant prezygotic isolation, as measured by mate choice tests. If the mating time between populations differed more than 1 h, the isolation index was significantly higher than zero. These findings indicate that premating isolation can be established by a pleiotropic effect of a clock gene. There are many examples in which the difference in timing of reproduction prevents gene flow between populations, such as the egg spawning time in marine organisms, the flowering time in angiosperms, and the time of mating in insects. In, such, organisms; if genetic correlations between circadian rhythm and reproductive traits exist, multifarious divergent selection for life history traits would often accelerate the evolution of reproductive isolation through clock genes. Natural populations may diverge in reproduction time through drift, direct natural selection for time of reproduction, or as a by-product effect of genetic correlations. In any case, clock genes are keys in reproductive isolation.

**Lifetime reproductive output of Calliphora vicina and Lucilia sericata in outdoor caged and field populations; flight vs. egg production?**

Davies, L. 2006

Females of the blowflies Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy) and Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) maintained in sheltered outdoor cages and supplied with excess food, oviposited later than would have been expected from the temperature-sum. The survival rates of the caged flies was high and the isolation of flies from predation, extreme temperatures and food shortages is likely to have contributed to this. Despite good survival rates, subsequent egg production over the greater part of the adult life span was reduced to similar to 24% for C. vicina and similar to 55% for L. sericata, of the potential expected from the published temperature-sums required for the maturation of successive egg batches. The data suggest that under field-cage conditions there is a considerable variation in egg development between individuals of the same age and that this variation should not be overlooked, since it may have significant implications in ecological and forensic investigations; however, the cause of this variability remains unclear. While lower than expected, the reproductive outputs recorded in the cages were nevertheless considerably greater than those that have been estimated for blowflies in the field and illustrate the potential for population increase in these species under favourable conditions. The possibility of a greater energy investment in flight activity relative to reproductive output in C. vicina compared to L. sericata is proposed.

**The temporal pattern of mating behavior of the fruit fly, Anastrepha zenildae in the laboratory**

de Almeida, LM; Araujo, A; Mendesc, NHD; de Souza, JMGA; Menezese, AAL. 2011

The state of Rio Grande do Norte is an important fruit-producing and exporting area in northeastern Brazil. The success of this industry depends on fruit fly population control, especially in fly-free exporting zones. However, many fruits are not exported because of quarantine restrictions imposed by importing countries. A survey in the state has detected a considerable increase of the fruit fly, Anastrepha zenildae Zucchi (Diptera: Tephritidae), probably a result of the introduction of irrigated guava orchards that make fruit available all year. Knowledge of the sexual behavior of Tephritidae has great importance to pest control programs, particularly those that employ the Sterile Insect Technique. In order to characterize the reproductive behavior of A. zenildae, 32 individuals (16 males; 16 females) in each of six generations were submitted to an artificial 12: 12 L:D cycle (750: < 1 lux, lights on 07:00-19:00) and observed over their lifetimes. The courtship and copulation occurred in leks and the episodes varied with the time of day, courtship being most frequent between zeitgeber time (ZT) 3 and ZT 7, peaking at ZT 5-6. Copulations occurred between ZT 2 and ZT 8, with a higher frequency between ZT 5-7 and a peak at ZT 6. Mean duration was 0.28 +/- 0.03 min/male (range: 5-163 min). Males in the leks attempted to copulate mainly between ZT 3 and ZT 7 with a peak at ZT 6, and males outside leks peaked at ZT 7. The different timing of sexual behaviors among related sympatric species, including A. zenildae, may contribute to species isolation.

**The likely fate of hybrids of Bactrocera tryoni and Bactrocera neohumeralis**

Pike, N; Wang, WYS; Meats, A. 2003

Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) and B. neohumeralis (Hardy) (Diptera: Tephritidae) are sympatric species which **hybrid**ise readily in the laboratory yet remain distinct in the field. B. tryoni mates only at dusk and B. neohumeralis mates only during the day, but **hybrid**s can mate at both times. We investigated the inheritance of mating time in successively backcrossed **hybrid** stocks to establish whether mating with either species is more likely. The progeny of all backcrosses to B. tryoni mated only at dusk. The majority of the progeny of the first and a minority of the progeny of the second backcross to B. neohumeralis also mated at dusk, but the third successive B. neohumeralis backcross produced flies that mated only during the day. This trend towards dominance of the B. tryoni trait was also reflected in a diagnostic morphological character. We discuss the possible genetic background for these phenomena and propose that unidirectional gene flow might explain how the two species remain distinct in the face of natural **hybrid**isation.

**REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF THE BOREAL RIPARIAN GUILD OF DROSOPHILA**

ASPI, J; LUMME, J; HOIKKALA, A; HEIKKINEN, E. 1993

The reproductive ecology of four sympatric Drosophila virilis group species (Diptera: Drosophilidae) was studied in the field to trace the factors maintaining species isolation. There was a high probability of meeting a heterospecific individual belonging to the same species group on the basis of adult spatial occurrence. Direct field observations revealed that the males court also females of the foreign species, but interspecific courtships do not lead to mating. The main mating period among these species lasted only several weeks, and the timing of mating periods differed markedly in the three most common species. Reproductive character displacement between species may explain the observed differences in the timing of the mating periods, but they could have arisen in the context of other selective pressures than the prevention of interspecific courtships and matings.

**The Lutzomyia longipalpis species complex: does population sub-structure matter to Leishmania transmission?**

Maingon, RDC; Ward, RD; Hamilton, JGC; Bauzer, LGSR; Peixoto, AA. 2008

Leishmania chagasi causes visceral leishmaniasis and, to a lesser extent, atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis in Central and South America. Its main sand fly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. (Diptera: Psychodidae) displays a complex population structure that might contribute to the observed clinical pleomorphism and to recent major urban epidemics. This article summarises our understanding on reproductive barriers and **hybrid**isation among this vector's sibling incipient species. Identifying genes important for sand fly ecological adaptability and sand fly-Leishmania genetic covariation could be helpful for interrupting Leishmania transmission.

**Host plant-related genomic differentiation in the European cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis cerasi**

Bakovic, V; Schuler, H; Schebeck, M; Feder, JL; Stauffer, C; Ragland, GJ. 2019

Elucidating the mechanisms and conditions facilitating the formation of biodiversity are central topics in evolutionary biology. A growing number of studies imply that divergent ecological selection may often play a critical role in speciation by counteracting the homogenising effects of gene flow. Several examples involve phytophagous insects, where divergent selection pressures associated with host plant shifts may generate reproductive isolation, promoting speciation. Here, we use ddRADseq to assess the population structure and to test for host-related genomic differentiation in the European cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis cerasi (L., 1758) (Diptera: Tephritidae). This tephritid is distributed throughout Europe and western Asia, and has adapted to two different genera of host plants, Prunus spp. (cherries) and Lonicera spp. (honeysuckle). Our data imply that geographic distance and geomorphic barriers serve as the primary factors shaping genetic population structure across the species range. Locally, however, flies genetically cluster according to host plant, with consistent allele frequency differences displayed by a subset of loci between Prunus and Lonicera flies across four sites surveyed in Germany and Norway. These 17 loci display significantly higher F-ST values between host plants than others. They also showed high levels of linkage disequilibrium within and between Prunus and Lonicera flies, supporting host-related selection and reduced gene flow. Our findings support the existence of sympatric host races in R. cerasi embedded within broader patterns of geographic variation in the fly, similar to the related apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella, in North America.

**Selective pollination by fungus gnats potentially functions as an alternative reproductive isolation among five Arisaema species**

Matsumoto, TK; Hirobe, M; Sueyoshi, M; Miyazaki, Y. 2021

Background and Aims Interspecific difference in pollinators (pollinator isolation) is important for reproductive isolation in flowering plants. Species-specific pollination by fungus gnats has been discovered in several plant taxa, suggesting that they can contribute to reproductive isolation. Nevertheless, their contribution has not been studied in detail, partly because they are too small for field observations during flower visitation. To quantify their flower visitation, we used the genus Arisaema (Araceae) because the pitcher-like spathe of Arisaema can trap all floral visitors. Methods We evaluated floral visitor assemblage in an altitudinal gradient including five Arisaema species. We also examined interspecific differences in altitudinal distribution (geographic isolation) and flowering phenology (phenological isolation). To exclude the effect of interspecific differences in altitudinal distribution on floral visitor assemblage, we established ten experimental plots including the five Arisaema species in high- and low-altitude areas and collected floral visitors. We also collected floral visitors in three additional sites. Finally, we estimated the strength and contribution of these three reproductive barriers using a unified formula for reproductive isolation. Key Results Each Arisaema species selectively attracted different fungus gnats in the altitudinal gradient, experimental plots and additional sites. Altitudinal distribution and flowering phenology differed among the five Arisaema species, whereas the strength of geographic and phenological isolations were distinctly weaker than those in pollinator isolation. Nevertheless, the absolute contribution of pollinator isolation to total reproductive isolation was weaker than geographic and phenological isolations, because pollinator isolation functions after the two early-acting barriers in plant life history. Conclusions Our results suggest that selective pollination by fungus gnats potentially contributes to reproductive isolation. Since geographic and phenological isolations can be disrupted by habitat disturbance and interannual climate change, the strong and stable pollinator isolation might compensate for the weakened early-acting barriers as an alternative reproductive isolation among the five Arisaema species.

**Swarming Behavior in Anopheles gambiae (sensu lato): Current Knowledge and Future Outlook**

Baeshen, R. 2022

Effective management of insect disease vectors requires a detailed understanding of their ecology and behavior. In Anopheles gambiaesensu lato (s.I.)(Diptera: Culicidae) mating occurs during swarming, but knowledge of their mating behavior under natural conditions is limited. Mosquitoes mate in flight over specific landmarks, known as swarm markers, at particular locations. Swarms consist of males; the females usually approach the swarm and depart following copulation. The number of mating pairs per swarm is closely associated with swarm size.The shape and height of swarm markers vary and may depend on the environmental conditions at the swarm's location. Male-male interactions in mosquito swarms with similar levels of attractive flight activity can offer a mating advantage to some individuals. Flight tone is used by mosquitoes to recognize the other sex and choose a desirable mate. Clarifying these and other aspects of mosquito reproductive behavior can facilitate the development of population control measures that target swarming sites.This review describes what is currently known about swarming behavior in Anopheles gambiae s.I., including swarm characteristics; mating within and outside of swarms, insemination in females, and factors affecting and stimulating swarming.

**Natural incidence of fruit flies with character states intermediate to those of the sibling species Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) and B-neohumeralis (Hardy) (Diptera : Tephritidae)**

Pike, N. 2004

Naturally occurring flies of intermediate form between Bactrocera tryoni and B. neohumeralis have been known since the 1950s, and their resemblance to laboratory **hybrid**s has been repeatedly noted. It has been demonstrated that although intermediates may be **hybrid**s, these may equally be the consequence of intraspecific variation within either parent species. This paper aims to provide insight into the true nature of field-collected intermediate flies by assessing their appearance, their mating behaviour and their incidence relative to the abundance of the parent species. Flies were reared from a variety of infested fruit that was collected over an 8 day period from coastal regions of south-eastern and central Queensland. The vast majority (93%) of the >4000 flies collected were B. tryoni. B. neohumeralis and intermediates, respectively, comprised only 5% and 2% of the population. The callus colour and patterning of intermediates did not change as flies matured. The majority of intermediates tended to have brownish calli and exhibited courtship behaviour during the day. Intercrossing of these intermediates led to a large number of flies that were morphologically identical to B. neohumeralis, although intermediate types did persist throughout the two subsequent generations studied. These data provide circumstantial evidence for the occurrence of interspecific gene flow, particularly in the direction of B. neohumeralis, but do not discount the possibility of a non-**hybrid** origin of intermediate flies.

**Radiation and divergence in the Rhagoletis Pomonella species complex: inferences from DNA sequence data**

Xie, X; Michel, AP; Schwarz, D; Rull, J; Velez, S; Forbes, AA; Aluja, M; Feder, JL. 2008

Here, we investigate the evolutionary history and pattern of genetic divergence in the Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) sibling species complex, a model for sympatric speciation via host plant shifting, using 11 anonymous nuclear genes and mtDNA. We report that DNA sequence results largely coincide with those of previous allozyme studies. Rhagoletis cornivora was basal in the complex, distinguished by fixed substitutions at all loci. Gene trees did not provide reciprocally monophyletic relationships among US populations of R. pomonella, R. mendax, R. zephyria and the undescribed flowering dogwood fly. However, private alleles were found for these taxa for certain loci. We discuss the implications of the results with respect to identifiable genetic signposts (stages) of speciation, the mosaic nature of genomic differentiation distinguishing formative species and a concept of speciation mode plurality involving a biogeographic contribution to sympatric speciation in the R. pomonella complex.

**Molecular characterization of Psyttalia lounsburyi, a candidate biocontrol agent of the olive fruit fly, and its Wolbachia symbionts as a pre-requisite for future intraspecific hybridization**

Cheyppe-Buchmann, S; Bon, MC; Warot, S; Jones, W; Malausa, T; Fauvergue, X; Ris, N. 2011

Numerous arthropod species are genetically differentiated across their distribution area. Diversifying the geographical origins of a biocontrol agent species can be used to favour their perennial establishment by the sampling of pre-adapted genotypes and/or the production of new genotypes through **hybrid**ization. **Hybrid**ization can be nevertheless challenged by reproductive isolations induced by some common microbial endosymbionts. In this study, we aimed at characterizing (i) the genetic diversity of six populations of Psyttalia lounsburyi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a candidate biocontrol agent of the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Diptera: Tephritidae) and (ii) the diversity of their Wolbachia endosymbionts. Both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers evidence clustering between the South African population and several Kenyan/Namibian populations. The survey of the Wolbachia also distinguished two main variants with a spatial heterogeneity in the infection status. All these results are discussed in the context of the use of these P. lounsburyi populations for **hybrid**ization and further field releases.

**Resolving the synonymy and polyphyly of the 'Drosophila bakoue species complex' (Diptera: Drosophilidae: 'D. montium species group') with descriptions of two new species from Madagascar**

Yassin, A; Suwalski, A; Raveloson Ravaomanarivo, LH. 2019

The 'D. bakoue species complex' Rafael, 1984 ('D. montium species group' Da Lage et al., 2007) comprises seven Afrotropical species. Using complete mitochondrial genome sequences and detailed morphological analysis, we revised the phylogenetic relationships between these species including two new ones. We found the 'D. bakoue species complex' to be a junior synonym of the 'D. seguyi species complex' Lachaise, 1971 and its seven species polyphyletic. We thus classified the species into three complexes, the 'D. seguyi species complex' comprises D. seguyi Smart, 1945, D. malagassya Tsacas & Rafael, 1982, D. curta Chassagnard & Tsacas, 1997 and D. chocolata sp. nov., the new 'D. tsacasi species complex' comprises D. tsacasi Bock & Wheeler, 1972 and D. seguyiana Chassagnard & Tsacas, 1997, and the new 'D. vulcana species complex' comprises D. vulcana Graber, 1957 and D. mylenae sp. nov. Drosophila bakoue Tsacas & Lachaise, 1974 could not be assigned to any of the defined complexes. The two new species are endemic to Madagascar and we report the presence of D. seguyi and D. curta in Mayotte and Madagascar, respectively. The results hence represent a significant step towards understanding the diversity and evolution of this species group in Africa and the islands of the Western Indian Ocean.

**Histories of host shifts and cospeciation among free-living parasitoids of Rhagoletis flies**

Hamerlinck, G; Hulbert, D; Hood, GR; Smith, JJ; Forbes, AA. 2016

Host shifts by specialist insects can lead to reproductive isolation between insect populations that use different hosts, promoting diversification. When both a phytophagous insect and its ancestrally associated parasitoid shift to the same novel host plant, they may cospeciate. However, because adult parasitoids are free living, they can also colonize novel host insects and diversify independent of their ancestral host insect. Although shifts of parasitoids to new insect hosts have been documented in ecological time, the long-term importance of such shifts to parasitoid diversity has not been evaluated. We used a genus of flies with a history of speciation via host shifting (Rhagoletis [Diptera: Tephritidae]) and three associated hymenopteran parasitoid genera (Diachasma, Coptera and Utetes) to examine cophylogenetic relationships between parasitoids and their host insects. We inferred phylogenies of Rhagoletis, Diachasma, Coptera and Utetes and used distance-based cophylogenetic methods (ParaFit and PACo) to assess congruence between fly and parasitoid trees. We used an event-based method with a free-living parasitoid cost model to reconstruct cophylogenetic histories of each parasitoid genus and Rhagoletis. We found that the current species diversity and host-parasitoid associations between the Rhagoletis flies and parasitoids are the primary result of ancient cospeciation events. Parasitoid shifts to ancestrally unrelated hosts primarily occur near the branch tips, suggesting that host shifts contribute to recent parasitoid species diversity but that these lineages may not persist over longer time periods. Our analyses also stress the importance of biologically informed cost models when investigating the coevolutionary histories of hosts and free-living parasitoids.

**The genetic basis for fruit odor discrimination in Rhagoletis flies and its significance for sympatric host shifts**

Dambroski, HR; Linn, C; Berlocher, SH; Forbes, AA; Roelofs, W; Feder, JL. 2005

Rhagoletis ponionella (Diptera: Tephritidae) use volatile compounds emitted from the surface of ripening fruit as important chemosensory cues for recognizing and distinguishing among alternative host plants. Host choice is of evolutionary significance in Rhagoletis because these flies mate on or near the fruit of their respective host plants. Differences in host choice based on fruit odor discrimination therefore result in differential mate choice and prezygotic reproductive isolation, facilitating sympatric speciation in the absence of geographic isolation. We test for a genetic basis for host fruit odor discrimination through an analysis of F-2 and backcross **hybrid**s constructed between apple-, hawthorn-, and flowering dogwood-infesting Rhagoletis flies. We recovered a significant proportion (30-65%) of parental apple, hawthorn, and dogwood fly response phenotypes in F2 **hybrid**s, despite the general failure of F, **hybrid**s to reach odor source spheres. Segregation patterns in F2 and backcross **hybrid**s suggest that only a modest number of aflelic differences at a few loci may underlie host fruit odor discrimination. In addition, a strong bias was observed for F-2 and backcross flies to orient to the natal fruit blend of their maternal grandmother, implying the existence of cytonuclear gene interactions. We explore the implications of our findings for the evolutionary dynamics of sympatric host race formation and speciation.

**Sequential radiation of unrelated organisms: the gall fly Eurosta solidaginis and the tumbling flower beetle Mordellistena convicta**

Abrahamson, WG; Blair, CP; Eubanks, MD; Morehead, SA. 2003

Host shifts and the formation of insect-host races are likely common processes in the speciation of herbivorous insects. The interactions of goldenrods Solidago (Compositae), the gall fly Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae) and the beetle Mordellistena convicta (Coleoptera: Mordellidae) provide behavioural, ecological and genetic evidence of host races that may represent incipient species forming via sympatric speciation. We summarize evidence for Eurosta host races and show that M. convicta has radiated from goldenrod stems to Eurosta galls to form host-part races and, having exploited the galler's host shift, has begun to differentiate into host races within galls. Thus, host-race formation has occurred in two interacting, but unrelated organisms representing two trophic levels, resulting in 'sequential radiation' (escalation of biodiversity up the trophic system). Distributions of host races and their behavioural isolating mechanisms suggest sympatric differentiation. Such differentiation suggests host-race formation and subsequent speciation may be an important source of biodiversity.

**Comparison of two polymorphic sites in the clock gene cryptochrome in the Taiwan strain of the melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae): a possible quick method to estimate the mating time of trapped invading flies**

Fuchikawa, T; Matsuyama, T; Yamagishi, M; Nakayama, S; Okada, K; Miyatake, T. 2011

For successful sterile insect technique (SIT), synchronized copulation between invaded females and sterilized males is required. Understanding the mating time of the invaded strain is an aid in synchronizing and thus improving the effectiveness of SIT. We previously demonstrated a relationship between variation at two sites of a circadian clock gene cryptochrome (cry) (cry1212 and cry1865) and circadian behavior in the melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett). Here we investigated the relationship in two other populations, Taiwan1 (T1) and Taiwan2 (T2), which may re-invade Okinawa. The results showed that T1 exhibited a lower frequency of the S-type allele, which was observed in early mating flies in the strains in Okinawa, than T2 at the site of cry1212. In addition, T1 showed a longer circadian period than T2. We also noted that the cry1212 site showed higher amino acid sequence conservation than cry1865 by comparing CRY1 among five insect species. These results suggest that genotyping of only the cry1212 site of trapped flies enables an immediate estimate of the mating time of the B. cucurbitae population from Taiwan and that cry1212 would be more likely to be involved in determining the mating time than cry1865.

**Characterization of copulatory courtship song in the Old World sand fly species Phlebotomus argentipes**

Araki, AS; Brazil, RP; Hamilton, JGC; Vigoder, FM. 2020

Acoustic communication in the form of courtship and mating songs are often involved in reproductive isolation between species of Diptera, such as Drosophila, mosquitoes and sand flies. The patterns of courtship songs in New World sand fly species evolve quickly under sexual selection; and therefore, represent an important trait that can be used as a marker to study the evolution of species complexes and may aid identification of sibling species with a complex. The ability to identify vector species within species complexes is of critical importance for effective and efficient vector control programs. Species-specific song patterns seems to contribute to reproductive isolation in New World sand fly species, suggesting that auditory communication signals may be widespread among these important vectors of leishmaniasis. The main goal of the present study was to characterize the copulatory courtship song of Phlebotomus argentipes, an important vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Old World. Ph. argentipes males produce acoustic signals during copulation and two types of songs were observed. The one we called primary song is a 'pulse song' with similar length and amplitude to the previously observed 'P1' pattern recorded in Brazilian populations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. The secondary song has 'sine song' characteristics and is quite different from any song produced by New World species. The discovery of this copulation courtship songs in Ph. argentipes supports the possibility that acoustic communication in sandflies might be more widespread than previously thought, including Old World species. Our results highlight the importance of further research on acoustic communication in the Ph. argentipes species complex and other Old World vectors of leishmaniasis.

**Alternative Mating Tactics as Potential Prezygotic Barriers to Gene Flow Between Two Sister Species of Frugivorous Fruit Flies**

Tadeo, E; Aluja, M; Rull, J. 2013

Rhagoletis completa Cresson and Rhagoletis zoqui Bush, are two sister species in the suavis group that were thought to occupy non-overlapping geographical ranges. Recent discovery of a contact zone in North Eastern M,xico where natural interspecific **hybrid**s with intermediate morphotypes can be found has led to laboratory studies in small enclosures that failed to identify the existence of reproductive barriers capable of maintaining the genetic integrity of both species. Because the experimental approach used in such studies could have interfered with natural behavior of flies, a series of additional mating compatibility tests under much less restrictive conditions were performed. Our observations, confirmed the fact that males and females of both species engage in interspecific matings. However, R. completa females were more reluctant to engage in heterospecific matings than R. zoqui females, revealing asymmetries in sexual isolation. Also, careful scrutiny of male guarding behavior and species specific partitioning of mating location unveiled subtle differences that could result in reproductive isolation if reinforced during secondary contact.

**The evolution of sex pheromones in an ecologically diverse genus of flies**

Symonds, MRE; Moussalli, A; Elgar, MA. 2009

In theory, pheromones important in specific mate recognition should evolve via large shifts in composition (saltational changes) at speciation events. However, where other mechanisms exist to ensure reproductive isolation, no such selection for rapid divergence is expected. In Bactrocera fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae), males produce volatile chemicals to attract females for mating. Bactrocera species exhibit great ecological diversity, with a wide range of geographical locations and host plants used. They also have other mechanisms, including temporal and behavioural differences, which ensure reproductive isolation. Therefore, we predicted that their sex pheromones would not exhibit rapid divergence at speciation events. In the present study, we tested this idea by combining data on male sex pheromone composition for 19 species of Bactrocera with a phylogeny constructed from DNA sequence data. Analyses of the combined data revealed positive correlations between pheromone differences and nucleotide divergence between species, and between the number of pheromone changes along the phylogeny and the branch lengths associated with these changes. These results suggest a gradual rather than saltational mode of evolution. However, remarkable differences in sex pheromones composition exist, even between closely-related species. It appears therefore that the mode of evolution of sex pheromones in Bactrocera is best described by rapid saltational changes associated with speciation, followed by gradual divergence thereafter. Furthermore, species that do not overlap ecologically are just as different pheromonally as species that do. Thus, large changes in pheromone composition appear to be achieved, even in cases where other mechanisms to ensure reproductive isolation exist. We suggest that these differences are closely associated with rapid changes in host plant use, which is a characteristic feature of Bactrocera speciation.

**Imaginal disc growth factor 4 regulates development and temperature adaptation in Bactrocera dorsalis**

Gu, XY; Li, ZH; Su, Y; Zhao, Y; Liu, LJ. 2019

The oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is an important invasive pest with high reproductive capacity and invasiveness; it has shown remarkable range expansion and brings higher risk to the environment and agriculture. The insect cuticle serves as skin and skeleton, protecting insects against numerous harmful stresses. One gene named imaginal disc growth factor 4 (idgf4) which is involved in cuticle formation, plays an important role in organizing proteins in the chitin-matrix, as well as in adult molting. This gene in the poorly-described glycoside hydrolase 18 (GH 18) family was chosen to study the function of chitinases in insect defense barrier against heat and molting using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and RNA interference (RNAi). qRT-PCR showed that idgf4 was expressed in all nine developmental stages and was mainly expressed in the early and late pupal, as well as adult stages. Knocking down the idgf4 gene via RNAi in 3rd instar larvae led to the decreased survival of larvae under high temperatures and malformed individuals as adults. The results indicated the function of the idgf4 gene in the fruit fly's defense barrier and development. It can provide new insights into understanding the function of one member in the GH 18 family, and may reveal a new potential gene for pest control.

**Trypanosome transmission dynamics in tsetse**

Aksoy, S; Weiss, BL; Attardo, GM. 2014

Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are vectors of African trypanosomes. Tsetse undergo viviparous reproductive biology, and depend on their obligate endosymbiont (genus Wigglesworthia) for the maintenance of fecundity and immune system development. Trypanosomes establish infections in the midgut and salivary glands of the fly. Tsetse's resistance to trypanosome infection increases as a function of age. Among the factors that mediate resistance to parasites are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the Immune deficiency (Imd) signaling pathway, peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) LB, tsetse-EP protein and the integrity of the midgut peritrophic matrix (PM) barrier. The presence of obligate Wigglesworthia during larval development is essential for adult immune system maturation and PM development. Thus, Wigglesworthia prominently influences the vector competency of its tsetse host.

**Interactions of the males and females of three sympatric Drosophila virilis group species, D-montana, D-littoralis, and D-lummei, (Diptera : Drosophilidae) in intra- and interspecific courtships in the wild and in the laboratory**

Liimatainen, JO; Hoikkala, A. 1998

Four species of the Drosophila virilis group, D. montana, D, littoralis, D. lummei, and D. ezoana, occur sympatrically in several locations in northern Europe. Courtship interactions between the flies of the three first-mentioned species were observed at malt baits in Kemi, northern Finland, to find out how the flies of different species recognize conspecific individuals and how, interspecific courtships differ from intraspecific ones in the wild. Intraspecific courtships (including females of different reproductive stages) and interspecific courtships were also videotaped and analyzed in laboratory. In the wild the males courted both conspecific and allospecific females, even though the species varied in howl much the males were attracted to females of different species. Interspecific courtships usually broke off when the male touched the female or when the male and/or the female vibrated his/her wings, producing acoustic cues. In the laboratory males courted conspecific females irrespective of the reproductive stage of the female, even though the courtships directed toward immature and fertilized females usually included only or orienting and touching (no licking and singing). D. littoralis, and very rarely D. montana and D. lummei, males courted also allospecific females. In the few interspecific courtships between these three species, where the male proceeded to singing, females responded to male singing by vibrating their wings. This ended the courtship. It is suggested that both the chemical cues affecting female attractivity and the acoustic signals of males and females, which are produced by wing vibration, function in maintaining sexual isolation between these three species.

**Cryptic biodiversity in the cytogenome of bird-biting blackflies in North Africa**

Adler, PH; Cherairia, M; Arigue, SF; Samraoui, B; Belqat, B. 2015

Bird-biting blackflies in the Simulium (Eusimulium) aureum group (Diptera: Simuliidae) are widespread vectors of Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma parasites. The polytene chromosomes of 619 larvae of the three nominal members of the S.aureum group in North Africa were evaluated cytogenetically for cryptic biodiversity. Seven chromosomal segregates were discovered among 29 populations in Algeria and Morocco. This diversity was based primarily on two chromosomal inversions, which have assumed unique roles in different lineages, including sex linkage, fixation, loss and autosomal polymorphism. Reproductive isolation was demonstrated for six of the seven segregates, doubling the number of species known in the area. Four species were linked with existing names: (a) Simulium mellahGiudicelli & Bouzidi, which is known only from North African high-salinity habitats; (b) Simulium petricolum (Rivosecchi), which is tentatively conspecific with continental European populations; (c) Simulium rubzovianum (Sherban) and its synonym Simulium latinum (Rubtsov), which is widely distributed from North Africa across Europe into Western Asia, and (d) Simulium velutinum (Santos Abreu) and its new synonym Simulium tenerificumCrosskey, which is restricted to North Africa and the Canary Islands. Of the remaining entities, two are new species precinctive to North Africa and one, known only from Morocco, is of undetermined taxonomic status.

**Revisiting the particular role of host shifts in initiating insect speciation**

Forbes, AA; Devine, SN; Hippee, AC; Tvedte, ES; Ward, AKG; Widmayer, HA; Wilson, CJ. 2017

The notion that shifts to new hosts can initiate insect speciation is more than 150 years old, yet widespread conflation with paradigms of sympatric speciation has led to confusion about how much support exists for this hypothesis. Here, we review 85 insect systems and evaluate the relationship between host shifting, reproductive isolation, and speciation. We sort insects into five categories: (1) systems in which a host shift has initiated speciation; (2) systems in which a host shift has made a contribution to speciation; (3) systems in which a host shift has caused the evolution of new reproductive isolating barriers; (4) systems with host-associated genetic differences; and (5) systems with no evidence of host-associated genetic differences. We find host-associated genetic structure in 65 systems, 43 of which show that host shifts have resulted in the evolution of new reproductive barriers. Twenty-six of the latter also support a role for host shifts in speciation, including eight studies that definitively support the hypothesis that a host shift has initiated speciation. While this review is agnostic as to the fraction of all insect speciation events to which host shifts have contributed, it clarifies that host shifts absolutely can and do initiate speciation.

**Cuticular hydrocarbons of Glossina .3. Subgenera glossina and Nemorhina**

Sutton, BD; Carlson, DA. 1997

The cuticular methyl-branched alkanes of tsetse flies of the subgenera Glossina (sensu stricto, formerly morsitans) and Nemorhina (formerly palpalis) were identified and quantified by capillary gas-liquid chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Males of Glossina (Nemorhina) are differentiated from G. (Glossina) by dominant 27-, 28-, and/or 29-carbon backbone trimethylalkanes with the methyl positions at 3,7,11-, 4,8,12-, and 3,7,11-, respectively. All females contain major quantities of long-chain internally branched di- and/or trimethylalkanes that were previously implicated as mediators of sexual behavior in males. Taxa within these two subgroups that are closely related and/or conspecific, based upon conventional morphological and ecological criteria, exhibit similar GC patterns and similar internally branched di- and trimethylalkane isomers in females. Examination of these potentially stimulatory methylalkanes may provide reasons for the reproductive isolation of closely related species from each other.

**Breeding barriers at a diploid-hexaploid contact zone in Aster amellus**

Castro, S; Munzbergova, Z; Raabova, J; Loureiro, J. 2011

Polyploidization is an important mechanism of sympatric speciation, but few studies have addressed breeding barriers between polyploids and their diploid progenitors in the field, and the available data have been mainly obtained from diploid-tetraploid contact zones. In contrast to diploid-tetraploid complexes, **hybrid**ization between diploid and hexaploid individuals may lead to viable fertile tetraploid offspring, and thus the interactions between these ploidy levels can be more complex. We investigated the breeding barriers operating between diploid and hexaploid individuals of Aster amellus at a contact zone in Central Europe to understand the absence of **hybrid**s (i.e., tetraploids) and mixed populations. Phenological segregation, assortative mating mediated by pollinators and crossing ability were assessed under natural and controlled conditions in diploid and hexaploid populations growing in close proximity. The results revealed low levels of reproductive isolation (RI) due to flowering phenology (RI = 11-45%) and pollinator behavior (RI = 17%), so that pollen transfer between diploids and hexaploids is possible. In contrast, almost complete reproductive isolation was observed due to a series of post-pollination barriers that significantly reduced the production of offspring from inter-cytotype crosses (RI = 99.9%), even though some tetraploids were detected in seeds and seedlings. We conclude that the absence of tetraploids at the contact zone is probably due to a combination of several factors, including spatial segregation, strong post-pollination barriers (such as gametic isolation, low viability of tetraploid seeds and/or inability of tetraploid plants to reach the flowering stage), and to a lesser extent, temporal and behavioral segregation. Future studies should explore the fitness of tetraploids and the effect of different traits on the reproductive success and fitness of each cytotype. This will enable a fuller understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms acting in contact zones.

**Genetic divergence in the cacophony IVS6 intron among five Brazilian populations of Lutzomyia longipalpis**

Bottecchia, M; Oliveira, SG; Bauzer, LGSR; Souza, NA; Ward, RD; Garner, KJ; Kyriacou, CP; Peixoto, AA. 2004

Genes involved in the reproductive isolation are particularly useful as molecular markers in speciation studies. Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae), a putative species complex, is a vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Latin America. We isolated from this species a fragment homologous to cacophony, a Drosophila gene that encodes features of the lovesong, all acoustic signal that is important in the sexual isolation of closely related species and known to vary considerably among L. longipalpis putative siblings species. Using an intron of the sandfly cacophony as a marker, we analyzed the molecular variation and sequence divergence among five populations of L. longipalpis from Brazil, three allopatric (Jacobina, Lapinha and Natal) and two putative sympatric sibling species from the locality of Sobral. A high level of polymorphism was found and analysis of the data indicates that very little gene flow is occurring among the populations of Jacobina, Lapinha, and Natal. A high level of differentiation was also observed between the two putative sympatric species of Sobral, one of which seems to be the same sibling species found in Natal, while the other is somewhat more related to Jacobina and Lapinha. However, the amount of estimated gene flow among the Sobral siblings is about seven time!; higher than the previously estimated for period, another lovesong gene, perhaps indicating that introgression might be affecting cacophony, more than period. The results suggest that L. longipalpis is not a single species in Brazil, but it is yet not clear whether the different populations studied deserve species status rather than representing an incipient speciation process.

**Selective maintenance of allozyme differences among sympatric host races of the apple maggot fly**

Feder, JL; Roethele, JB; Wlazlo, B; Berlocher, SH. 1997

Whether phytophagous insects can speciate in sympatry when they shift and adapt to new host plants is a controversial question, One essential requirement for sympatric speciation is that disruptive selection outweighs gene flow between insect populations using different host plants. Empirical support for host-related selection (i.e., fitness trade-offs) is scant, however. Here, we test for host-dependent selection acting on apple (Malus pumila)- and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae). In particular, we examine whether the earlier fruiting phenology of apple trees favors pupae in deeper states of diapause (or with slower metabolisms/development rates) in the apple fly race. By experimentally lengthening the time period preceding winter, we exposed hawthorn race pupae to environmental conditions typically faced by apple flies. This exposure induced a significant genetic response at six allozyme loci in surviving hawthorn fly adults toward allele frequencies found in the apple race. The sensitivity of hawthorn fly pupae to extended periods of warm weather therefore selects against hawthorn flies that infest apples and helps to maintain the genetic integrity of the apple race by counteracting gene flow from sympatric hawthorn populations. Our findings confirm that postzygotic reproductive isolation can evolve as a pleiotropic consequence of host-associated adaptation, a central tenet of nonallopatric speciation. They also suggest that one reason for the paucity of reported fitness trade-offs is a failure to consider adequately costs associated with coordinating an insect's life cycle with the phenology of its host plant.

**An X chromosome effect responsible for asymmetric reproductive isolation between male Drosophila virilis and heterospecific females**

Nickel, D; Civetta, A. 2009

Reproductive isolation between closely related species is expressed through uncoordinated courtship, failed fertilization, and (or) postzygotic barriers. Behavioural components of mating often form an initial barrier to **hybrid**ization between species. In many animals, females are responsible for mating discrimination in both intra- and interspecific crosses; males of Drosophila virilis group represent an exception to this trend. Using overall productivity tests, we show that a lower proportion of D. virilis males sire progeny when paired with a heterospecific female (Drosophila novamexicana or Drosophila americana texana) for 2 weeks. This suggests male mate discrimination or some other kind of asymmetrical incompatibility in courtship and mating or early zygote mortality. We used males from D. virilis - D. novamexicana and from D. virilis - D. a. texana backcross populations to map chromosome effects responsible for male reproductive isolation. Results from the analysis of both backcross male populations indicate a major X chromosome effect. Further, we conduct a male behavioural analysis to show that D. virilis males significantly fail to continue courtship after the first step of courtship, when they tap heterospecific females. The combined results of a major X chromosome effect and the observation that D. virilis males walk away from females after tapping suggest that future studies should concentrate on the identification of X-linked genes affecting the ability of males to recognize conspecific females.

**Non-target host risk assessment of the idiobiont parasitoid Bracon celer (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) for biological control of olive fruit fly in California**

Nadel, H; Daane, KM; Hoelmer, KA; Pickett, CH; Johnson, MW. 2009

Non-target risk posed by an African parasitoid, Bracon celer Szepligeti (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), was assessed for a classical biological control program against olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae), in California, USA. Behavioral and reproductive responses to nontarget tephritid species were tested with beneficial (Chaetorellia succinea [Costa] and Parafreutreta regalis Munro) (Tephritidae: Tephritinae) and native (Rhagoletis fausta [Osten Sacken]) (Tephritidae: Trypetinae) fruit fly species in successive no-choice and choice experiments under close confinement in quarantine. Nontarget host-plant substrates exposed to B. celer were yellow-starthistle flower heads containing C. succinea, Cape ivy stem galls containing P. regalis, and bitter-cherry fruit containing R. fausta. The parasitoid probed all three infested nontarget plant substrates, but significantly less than olives infested with B. oleae. It produced offspring from P. regalis in Cape ivy stem galls, but appeared unable to penetrate yellow-starthistle flower heads with its ovipositor. Bracon celer killed some B. oleae and R. fausta larvae without parasitism. Reproduction on P. regalis indicates that B. celer has a broad physiological host range, which, combined with the parasitoid's acceptance of all three host-plant substrates, indicates a strong potential to negatively impact non-target species. Although physical and temporal barriers to host attack may reduce risk to most non-target tephritids by B. celer in California, the parasitoid should not be released due to its risk of harming the beneficial P. regalis. Release of P. regalis is still under consideration, however, and final risk assessment should depend on whether the fly proves useful for weed control.

**Experimental evidence of genome-wide impact of ecological selection during early stages of speciation-with-gene-flow**

Egan, SP; Ragland, GJ; Assour, L; Powell, THQ; Hood, GR; Emrich, S; Nosil, P; Feder, JL. 2015

Theory predicts that speciation-with-gene-flow is more likely when the consequences of selection for population divergence transitions from mainly direct effects of selection acting on individual genes to a collective property of all selected genes in the genome. Thus, understanding the direct impacts of ecologically based selection, as well as the indirect effects due to correlations among loci, is critical to understanding speciation. Here, we measure the genome-wide impacts of host-associated selection between hawthorn and apple host races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae), a model for contemporary speciation-with-gene-flow. Allele frequency shifts of 32455 SNPs induced in a selection experiment based on host phenology were genome wide and highly concordant with genetic divergence between co-occurring apple and hawthorn flies in nature. This striking genome-wide similarity between experimental and natural populations of R. pomonella underscores the importance of ecological selection at early stages of divergence and calls for further integration of studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics and genome divergence.

**Don't forget the flies: dipteran diversity and its consequences for floral ecology and evolution**

Raguso, RA. 2020

The attention of the global pollination community has been drawn to food safety and other ecosystem services provided by pollinators, in light of decline in social bee populations. Despite intensified research on bees, recent studies have revealed important contributions of flies to pollination success, reproductive isolation and floral diversification. Diptera is a highly diverse insect order, comprising over 125,000 described species in 110 families and representing a broad spectrum of ecological niches beyond the well-known agricultural pests and blood-feeding vectors of human and animal diseases. Flies are most appreciated as generalized pollinators in alpine habitats (anthomyiids and tachinids) and as specialized pollinators in brood-site deceptive plants that mimic fungi (drosophilids), feces (muscids) or carrion (sarcophagids and calliphorids). Syrphid and bombyliid flies visit many of the same flowers as bees and butterflies do, but with different impacts on plant fitness. Guilds of South African plants have evolved specialized relationships with long-tongued nemestrinid and tabanid flies, thanks to geographic isolation and climatic stability. Studies in Japan highlight the evolution of another plant guild, pollinated by sciarid and mycetophilid fungus gnats, whereas Zygothrica flies (Drosophilidae) pollinate mushroom-like Dracula orchids in Andean cloud forests.

**Speciation via habitat specialization: the evolution of reproductive isolation as a correlated character**

Rice, WR. 1987

A diverse group of theoretical and empirical studies are integrated into a composite model of sympatric speciation via habitat specialization, It is shown that disruptive selection on a continuous distribution of habitat preference can lead to the evolution of prezygotic reproductive isolation as a correlated character. The form of selection eliminates the major theoretical objections to the process of sympatric speciation. The principal difference between this model and the allopatric model of speciation is that the initial barrier to gene flow between subpopulations is produced by the evolution of gaps in the phenotypic distribution of spatial/temporal habitat use, rather than an extrinsic geographical barrier.

**The Reproductive Ecology of Diploid and Tetraploid Galax urceolata**

Barringer, BC; Galloway, LF. 2017

Polyploidy is common in nature, particularly among plants, and is often associated with significant morphological, ecological, and evolutionary change. These changes may contribute to prezygotic and postzygotic isolation between cytotypes; therefore, polyploidy is commonly thought to lead to speciation. Recent work suggests prezygotic mechanisms may be more important in determining isolation than postzygotic mechanisms. We compared the reproductive ecology of populations of diploid and tetraploid Galax to assess the potential for gene flow between the cytotypes. Galax urceolata is native to the southern Appalachian Mountains and is a natural polyploid series with diploid, triploid, and autotetraploid individuals occurring in uniform and mixed-cytotype populations. We found the temporal peak of flower production in tetraploids slightly preceded that of diploids; however, the overall distributions of flowering phenologies were similar. Hymenoptera and Diptera were the most common floral visitors and diploids were visited slightly more often than tetraploids; however, there were no differences between cytotypes in terms of the taxonomic composition of their floral visitors. Seed production is likely pollen limited, but again this does not differ between cytotypes. While tetraploids produced more flowers than diploids, there was no difference in fruit production. Finally, our data suggest that Galax urceolata is self-incompatible. In sum we found few differences in the reproductive ecology of diploid and tetraploid Galax, which when combined with obligate outcrossing increases the potential for gene flow between cytotypes and reduces the likelihood of differentiation.

**A FLY ON THE CAVE WALL: PARASITE GENETICS REVEAL FINE-SCALE DISPERSAL PATTERNS OF BATS**

Speer, KA; Luetke, E; Bush, E; Sheth, B; Gerace, A; Quicksall, Z; Miyamoto, M; Dick, CW; Dittmar, K; Albury, N; Reed, DL. 2019

Dispersal influences the evolution and adaptation of organisms, but it can be difficult to detect. Host-specific parasites provide information about the dispersal of their hosts and may be valuable for examining host dispersal that does not result in gene flow or that has low signals of gene flow. We examined the population connectivity of the buffy flower bat, Erophylla sezekorni (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae), and its associated obligate ectoparasite, Trichobius frequens (Diptera: Streblidae), across a narrow oceanic channel in The Bahamas that has previously been implicated as a barrier to dispersal in bats. Due to the horizontal transmission of T. frequens, we were able to test the hypothesis that bats are dispersing across this channel, but this dispersal does not result in gene flow, occurs rarely, or started occurring recently. We developed novel microsatellite markers for the family Streblidae in combination with previously developed markers for bats to genotype individuals from 4 islands in The Bahamas. We provide evidence for a single population of the host, E. sezekorni, but 2 populations of its bat flies, potentially indicating a recent reduction of gene flow in E. sezekorni, rare dispersal, or infrequent transportation of bat flies with their hosts. Despite high population differentiation in bat flies indicated by microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA shows no polymorphism, suggesting that bacterial reproductive parasites may be contributing to mitochondrial DNA sweeps. Parasites, including bat flies, provide independent information about their hosts and can be used to test hypotheses of host dispersal that may be difficult to assess using host genetics alone.

**Molecular evolution of the cacophony IVS6 region in sandflies**

Lins, RMMA; Oliveira, SG; Souza, NA; de Queiroz, RG; Justiniano, SCB; Ward, RD; Kyriacou, CP; Peixoto, AA. 2002

A number of insects produce acoustic signals during courtship. Genes involved in the control of the courtship song are particularly interesting from an evolutionary viewpoint because interspecific variation in this signal is potentially important as a reproductive isolation mechanism and, as a consequence, in the speciation process. The cacophony gene was identified by a mutation affecting the 'lovesong' in Drosophila melanogaster . Phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) also produce acoustic stimuli during courtship and therefore cacophony can be used as an interesting molecular marker in evolutionary studies in these important disease vectors. In this paper we have studied the molecular evolution of the IVS6 region of cacophony in sandflies. We compared the level of divergence in the exon sequences encoding this conserved domain in Drosophila and Phlebotomines. We also analysed the high level of variation in an intron that is present in sandflies but that was lost in Drosophila during evolution. The available cacophony sequences were also used for a phylogenetic analysis of some species of the Neotropical genus Lutzomyia.

**Evidence for X-linked introgression between molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae from Angola**

Choi, KS; Townson, H. 2012

The M and S molecular forms of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae) are morphologically identical incipient species in which reproductive isolation is incomplete, enabling low-level gene flow between forms. In an attempt to find differences between the M and S forms, sequence variation was studied at loci along the X chromosome in adult female An. gambiae from Angola. A high proportion of M form specimens from Angola (79% of the 456 X chromosomes sampled) were found to contain a 16-bp insertion in intron 4 of the X-linked GPRCCK1 locus, relative to the AgamP3 release of the An. gambiae PEST genome sequence. The insertion was in HardyWeinberg equilibrium in Angolan M form populations. The same insertion was found in all S form specimens examined, regardless of where in Africa they were sampled, but was absent from a sample of M form specimens collected in Ghana, Bioko and Mali. In M form specimens from Angola, there was an association between alleles at the GPRCCK1 locus and those at a microsatellite locus, AGXH678, close to the centromere of the X chromosome, with significant linkage disequilibrium between loci separated by 0.472 Mbp (P < 0.033). We show that the insertion results from introgression from the S form into the M form, rather than from the retention of an ancestral character. Gene flow from the S to M form could allow genes of adaptive value to be transferred, including those conferring insecticide resistance and others influencing ecology and behaviour, and thus malaria transmission and control. We discuss factors that may have led to this introgression event.

**Evidence for inversion polymorphism related to sympatric host race formation in the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella**

Feder, JL; Roethele, FB; Filchak, K; Niedbalski, J; Romero-Severson, J. 2003

Evidence suggests that the apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) is undergoing sympatric speciation (i.e., divergence without geographic isolation) in the process of shifting and adapting to a new host plant. Prior to the introduction of cultivated apples (Malus pumila) in North America, R. pomonella infested the fruit of native hawthorns (Crataegus spp.). However, sometime in the mid-1800s the fly formed a sympatric race on apple. The recently derived apple-infesting race shows consistent allele frequency differences from the hawthorn host race for six allozyme loci mapping to three different chromosomes. Alleles at all six of these allozymes correlate with the timing of adult eclosion, an event dependent on the duration of the overwintering pupal diapause. This timing difference differentially adapts the univoltine fly races to an similar to3- to 4-week difference in the peak fruiting times of apple and hawthorn trees, partially reproductively isolating the host races. Here, we report finding substantial gametic disequilibrium among allozyme and complementary DNA (cDNA) markers encompassing the three chromosomal regions differentiating apple and hawthorn flies. The regions of disequilibrium extend well beyond the previously characterized six allozyme loci, covering substantial portions of chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 (haploid n = 6 in R. pomonella). Moreover, significant recombination heterogeneity and variation in gene order were observed among single-pair crosses for each of the three genomic regions, implying the existence of inversion polymorphism. We therefore have evidence that genes affecting diapause traits involved in host race formation reside within large complexes of rearranged genes. We explore whether these genomic regions (inversions) constitute coadapted gene complexes and discuss the implications of our findings for sympatric speciation in Rhagoletis.

**Postzygotic isolating factor in sympatric speciation in Rhagoletis flies: Reduced response of hybrids to parental host-fruit odors**

Linn, CE; Darnbroski, HR; Feder, JL; Berlocher, SH; Nojima, S; Roelofs, WL. 2004

Rhagoletis pomonella is a model for sympatric speciation (divergence without geographic isolation) by means of host-plant shifts. Many Rhagoletis species are known to use fruit odor as a key olfactory cue to distinguish among their respective host plants. Because Rhagoletis rendezvous on or near the unabscised fruit of their hosts to mate, behavioral preferences for fruit odor translate directly into premating reproductive isolation among flies. Here, we report that reciprocal F, **hybrid**s between the apple and hawthorn host races of R. pomonelia, as well as between the host races and an undescribed sibling species infesting Cornus florida (flowering dogwood) do not respond to host fruit volatiles in wind-tunnel assays at doses that elicit maximal directed flight in parental flies. The reduced ability of **hybrid**s to orient to fruit volatiles could result from a conflict between neural pathways for preference and avoidance behaviors, and it suggests that **hybrid**s might suffer a fitness disadvantage for finding fruit in nature. Therefore, host-specific mating may play a dual role as an important postzygotic as well as a premating reproductive barrier to isolate sympatric Rhagoletis flies.

**First report on the diversity of insects trapped by a sticky exudate of the inflorescences of Vriesea bituminosa Wawra (Bromeliaceae: Tillandsioideae)**

Monteiro, RF; Macedo, MV. 2014

Vriesea bituminosa Wawra (Bromeliaceae) inflorescences produce a sticky and abundant mucilage, covering their entire surface. Insects get trapped in this exudate when visiting the inflorescences and eventually die. The aim of this study was to record the diversity of insects captured in, and those tolerant to, the mucilage of V. bituminosa inflorescences and to discuss the ecological role of this natural trap. The study was conducted in the Atlantic Forest, in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Insects were collected from 25 inflorescences of V. bituminosa. We obtained 268 individuals of 137 morphospecies of insects; similar to 50 % have phytophagous habits. We suggest that the exudate acts as a protective barrier against herbivory for this bromeliad species. However, some species such as the Epimorius suffusus moth (Pyralidae), Plunentis porosus (Coreidae), and two species of Diptera (Lauxaniidae and Drosophilidae) freely feed and reproduce on these inflorescences which suggests that they have suitable properties for utilization of the resources on the reproductive structures of this plant. The possible role of insects glued to inflorescences as a source of nutrients for this bromeliad is also discussed.

**Sequential divergence and the multiplicative origin of community diversity**

Hood, GR; Forbes, AA; Powell, THQ; Egan, SP; Hamerlinck, G; Smith, JJ; Feder, JL. 2015

Phenotypic and genetic variation in one species can influence the composition of interacting organisms within communities and across ecosystems. As a result, the divergence of one species may not be an isolated process, as the origin of one taxon could create new niche opportunities for other species to exploit, leading to the genesis of many new taxa in a process termed "sequential divergence." Here, we test for such a multiplicative effect of sequential divergence in a community of host-specific parasitoid wasps, Diachasma alloeum, Utetes canaliculatus, and Diachasmimorpha mellea (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), that attack Rhagoletis pomonella fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae). Flies in the R. pomonella species complex radiated by sympatrically shifting and ecologically adapting to new host plants, the most recent example being the apple-infesting host race of R. pomonella formed via a host plant shift from hawthorn-infesting flies within the last 160 y. Using population genetics, field-based behavioral observations, host fruit odor discrimination assays, and analyses of life history timing, we show that the same host-related ecological selection pressures that differentially adapt and reproductively isolate Rhagoletis to their respective host plants (host-associated differences in the timing of adult eclosion, host fruit odor preference and avoidance behaviors, and mating site fidelity) cascade through the ecosystem and induce host-associated genetic divergence for each of the three members of the parasitoid community. Thus, divergent selection at lower trophic levels can potentially multiplicatively and rapidly amplify biodiversity at higher levels on an ecological time scale, which may sequentially contribute to the rich diversity of life.

**Infection success in novel hosts: An experimental and phylogenetic study of Drosophila-parasitic nematodes**

Perlman, SJ; Jaenike, J. 2003

Surprisingly little is known about what determines a parasite's host range, which is essential in enabling us to predict the fate of novel infections. In this study, we evaluate the importance of both host and parasite phylogeny in determining the ability of parasites to infect novel host species. Using experimental lab assays, we infected 24 taxonomically diverse species of Drosophila flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae) with five different nematode species (Tylenchida: Allantonematidae: Howardula, Parasitylenchus), and measured parasite infection success, growth, and effects on female host fecundity (i.e., virulence). These nematodes are obligate parasites of mushroom-feeding Drosophila, particularly quinaria and testacea group species, often with severe fitness consequences on their hosts. We show that the potential host ranges of the nematodes are much larger than their actual ranges, even for parasites with only one known host species in nature. Novel hosts that are distantly related from the native host are much less likely to be infected, but among more closely related hosts, there is much variation in susceptibility. Potential host ranges differ greatly between the related parasite species. All nematode species that successfully infected novel hosts produced infective juveniles in these hosts. Most novel infections did not result in significant reductions in the fecundity of female hosts, with one exception: the host specialist Parasitylenchus nearcticus sterilized all quinaria group hosts, only one of which is a host in nature. The large potential host ranges of these parasites, in combination with the high potential for host colonization due to shared mushroom breeding sites, explain the widespread host switching observed in comparisons of nematode and Drosophila phylogenies.

**Intraguild interactions promote assortative mating and affect sexual attractiveness in a phytophagous fly**

Reader, T; Duce, IR. 2009

Changes in acoustic and substrate-borne sexual signals in phytophagous insects associated with host plant shifts are known to have the potential to promote assortative mating, reproductive isolation and speciation. In this article, we ask whether the switch between pure herbivory and intraguild predation (IGP), which is common amongst phytophagous insects, has similar potential. Male flies in the genus Lipara (Diptera: Chloropidae) search for females by vibrating reed stems and waiting for a reply. By kleptoparasitizing other phytophagous species in the genus (a form of IGP), Lipara rufitarsis can increase its nonsexual fitness considerably. We looked at the impact of IGP on the timing of hatching, body size and attractiveness of male calls in L. rufitarsis. L. rufitarsis males that had engaged in IGP hatched significantly earlier than purely phytophagous flies and were significantly larger, but their calls were less likely to elicit responses from females during playback experiments. We conclude that, although behavioural observations of females provided no evidence of 'like preferring like', changes in phenology associated with IGP are likely to promote assortative mating in this system. The general preference of females for the calls of smaller males is a phenomenon worthy of further study: it may have no adaptive significance, or it may indicate that mating with large males is associated with a fitness cost.

**Assortative mating and maintenance of intrapopulation polymorphism in wild populations and laboratory cultures of insects**

Benkovskaya, GV; Nikonorov, YM. 2015

Speciation as a micro-evolutionary process begins with emerging of intraspecies differentiation, which is associated with establishment of reproductive isolation. One of intrinsic isolation factors ensuring physiological isolation is assortative mating. In course of long-term field observations in the Southern Urals (Republic of Bashkortostan) and prolonged laboratory experiments, we have detected assortative mating in populations of potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Three morphotypes were singled out by the extent of integument melanization, namely achromists (A), melanists (M), and intermediate type (I), and frequency of occurrence of these morphotypes imago pairs significantly deviated from random distribution, thus manifesting the assortative mating. Under in copulo conditions, mating between achromist males (A) and melanist females (M) where active choice belonged to males was not registered. In laboratory experiments, in the sample of 40 artificially formed pairs, there were detected significant differences in longevity and fecundity of different morphotype imagoes. Achromists and melanists had significantly (almost two times) higher longevity as compared with intermediate type. Females of intermediate type were significantly more fecund in homonomous crossings than achromists and melanists. It is shown that pairs offspring also differs significantly in viability, with highest viability being characteristic for offspring from females of A- and I-type. The differences revealed are indicative of different reproductive strategies that exist in populations. In laboratory line S of house fly Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae) the presence of individuals with different reproductive strategies related to longevity is detected. Maximum longevity in inbred lines Sh28 (short living) and L2 (long living), isolated from the line S, significantly differed almost twofold. In the line of short living flies, mass reproduction occurs on the first second week of imago stage, while in long living flies it is put off to the third fourth week. In reciprocal crossings between the lines, drastic reduction in females fecundity is observed as well as reduction in viability of females from **hybrid** offspring. The results obtained are indicative of substantial role of assortative mating and frequencydependent selection in maintenance of intrapopulation diversity.

**Genetic divergence does not predict change in ornament expression among populations of stalk-eyed flies**

Swallow, JG; Wallace, LE; Christianson, SJ; Johns, PM; Wilkinson, GS. 2005

Stalk-eyed flies (Diptera: Diopsidae) possess eyes at the ends of elongated peduncles, and exhibit dramatic variation in eye span, relative to body length, among species. In some sexually dimorphic species, evidence indicates that eye span is under both intra- and intersexual selection. Theory predicts that isolated populations should evolve differences in sexually selected traits due to drift. To determine if eye span changes as a function of divergence time, 1370 flies from 10 populations of the sexually dimorphic species, Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni and Cyrtodiopsis whitei, and one population of the sexually monomorphic congener, Cyrtodiopsis quinqueguttata, were collected from Southeast Asia and measured. Genetic differentiation was used to assess divergence time by comparing mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase II and 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragments) and nuclear (wingless gene fragment) DNA sequences for c. five individuals per population. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that most populations cluster as monophyletic units with up to 9% nucleotide substitutions between populations within a species. Analyses of molecular variance suggest a high degree of genetic structure within and among the populations; > 97% of the genetic variance occurs between populations and species while < 3% is distributed within populations, indicating that most populations have been isolated for thousands of years. Nevertheless, significant change in the allometric slope of male eye span on body length was detected for only one population of either dimorphic species. These results are not consistent with genetic drift. Rather, relative eye span appears to be under net stabilizing selection in most populations of stalk-eyed flies. Given that one population exhibited dramatic evolutionary change, selection, rather than genetic variation, appears to constrain eye span evolution.

**Botanophila-Epichloe Interaction in a Wild Grass, Puccinellia distans, Lacks Dependence on the Fly Vector**

Gorzynska, K; Lembicz, M; Olszanowski, Z; Leuchtmann, A. 2011

In grass-infecting Epichloe (Ascomycetes: Clavicipitaceae) fungi, the transfer of spermatia for fungal fertilization depends on an insect vector: flies of the genus Botanophila (Diptera: Anthomyiidae). The flies use the fungal stroma, a spore-producing fungal structure surrounding the grass inflorescence, for laying eggs and as a food source for both adults and larvae. This fly-fungus interaction is generally regarded as obligatory and mutualistic. Two Botanophila taxa were noted among four populations of the nonagricultural grass Puccinellia distans (L.) Parl. that were infected with the fungus Epichloe typhina (Pers.) Tul. However, during the 7 yr of field observations, Botanophila flies were present every year in only one population of P. distans. The number of eggs per stroma ranged from zero to four and differed with year and site. Overall, eggs (or larvae) were observed on only 132 (19.2%) of the 687 stromata examined during the survey, with one (13.8%), two (4.5%), or more than two (0.9%) per stroma. However, 90.8% of the examined stromata were fertilized and produced perithecia, suggesting that other mechanisms or vectors of spermatia were responsible for fertilization.

**A novel preference for an invasive plant as a mechanism for animal hybrid speciation**

Schwarz, D; Shoemaker, KD; Botteri, NL; McPheron, BA. 2007

Homoploid **hybrid** speciation-speciation via **hybrid**ization without a change in chromosome number-is rarely documented and poorly understood in animals. In particular, the mechanisms by which animal homoploid **hybrid** species become ecologically and reproductively isolated from their parents are hypothetical and remain largely untested by experiments. For the many host-specific parasites that mate on their host, choosing the right host is the most important ecological and reproductive barrier between these species. One example of a host-specific parasite is the Lonicera fly, a population of tephritid fruit flies that evolved within the last 250 years likely by **hybrid**ization between two native Rhagoletis species following a host shift to invasive honeysuckle. We studied the host preference of the Lonicera fly and its putative parent species in laboratory experiments. The Lonicera fly prefers its new host, introduced honeysuckle, over the hosts of both parental species, demonstrating the rapid acquisition of preference for a new host as a means of behavioral isolation from the parent species. The parent taxa discriminate against each other's native hosts, but both accept honeysuckle fruit, leaving the potential for asymmetric gene flow from the parent species. Importantly, this pattern allows us to formulate hypotheses about the initial formation of the Lonicera fly. As mating partners from the two parent taxa are more likely to meet on invasive honeysuckle than on their respective native hosts, independent acceptance of honeysuckle by both parents likely preceded **hybrid**ization. We propose that invasive honeysuckle served as a catalyst for the local breakdown of reproductive isolation between the native parent species, a novel consequence of the introduction of an exotic weed. We describe behavioral mechanisms that explain the initial **hybrid**ization and subsequent reproductive isolation of the **hybrid** Lonicera fly. These results provide experimental support for a combination of host shift and **hybrid**ization as a model for **hybrid** speciation in parasitic animals.

**Fixed Differences in the paralytic Gene Define Two Lineages within the Lutzomyia longipalpis Complex Producing Different Types of Courtship Songs**

Lins, RMMA; Souza, NA; Brazil, RP; Maingon, RDC; Peixoto, AA. 2012

The sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae), the most important vector of American visceral leishmaniasis, is widely distributed in Latin America. There is currently a consensus that it represents a species complex, however, the number and distribution of the different siblings is still uncertain. Previous analyses have indicated that Brazilian populations of this vector can be divided into two main groups according to the type of courtship song (Burst vs. Pulse) males produce during copulation. Nevertheless, no diagnostic differences have been observed between these two groups with most molecular markers used to date. We analyzed the molecular divergence in a fragment of the paralytic (para) gene, a locus involved in the control of courtship songs in Drosophila, among a number of Lu. longipalpis populations from Brazil producing Burst and Pulse-type songs. Our results revealed a very high level of divergence and fixed differences between populations producing the two types of songs. We also compared Lu. longipalpis with a very closely related species, Lutzomyia cruzi, which produces Burst-type songs. The results indicated a higher number of fixed differences between Lu. cruzi and the Pulse-type populations of Lu. longipalpis than with those producing Burst-type songs. The data confirmed our previous assumptions that the presence of different sibling species of the Lu. longipalpis complex in Brazil can be divided into two main groups, one representing a single species and a second more heterogeneous group that probably represents a number of incipient species. We hypothesize that para might be one of the genes directly involved in the control of the courtship song differences between these two groups or that it is linked to other loci associated with reproductive isolation of the Brazilian species.

**Genetics, experience, and host-plant preference in Eurosta solidaginis: Implications for host shifts and speciation**

Craig, TP; Horner, JD; Itami, JK. 2001

Host-associated mating is crucial in maintaining the partial reproductive isolation between the host races of Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae), a Ay that forms galls on Solidago altissima and S. gigantea. (We refer to flies reared from S. gigantea as gigantea flies and those reared from S. altissima as altissima flies.) We measured the host preference of males and females of both host races, Fl **hybrid**s between the host races, FZ, and backcrosses to both host races. Male and female altissima flies and female gigantea flies had high host fidelity, whereas male gigantea flies had low host fidelity. This result suggests that there may be gene flow between the host races due to nonassortative mating that occurs when male gigantea mate with altissima females on S. altissima. This indicates assortative-mating mechanisms in addition to host-associated mating are required to produce the partial reproductive isolation between the host races that has been observed. Nongenetic factors had no influence on host preference. Larval conditioning did not influence host preference: reciprocal Fl **hybrid**s reared in S. altissima and S. gigantea both preferred S. gigantea. Adult experience had no impact on host preference: females preferred their natal host plant regardless of which host they encountered first as an adult. The hypothesis that maternal effects influence preferences was rejected because male and female flies did not show a consistent preference for the host plant of their mother. We also found no evidence that preference was a sex-linked trait because Fl and backcrosses to the host races with different combinations of X chromosomes from the two host races preferred S. gigantea. Our results indicate that host preference is not determined by a large number of genes because preference of **hybrid**s did not correspond to the proportion of the genome derived from each host race. The strength of the ovipuncture preference for S. gigantea by gigantea females, the females of both reciprocal F-1 **hybrid**s, the backcross to gigantea, and F(2)s indicates that preference is inherited nonadditively at a limited number of loci. The F1 female **hybrid**s, however, had a weaker host preference for S. gigantea than the pure gigantea host race, indicating that there may be incomplete dominance or modifier loci. Males had different host preference patterns than females, with individual male gigantea and male Fl **hybrid**s usually exhibiting preference exclusively for S. gigantea or S. altissima. One hypothesis explaining the difference in host preference between males and females is that the same gene influences both female and male host preference, but it is a sex-influenced gene. Thus, males carrying the gene for S. gigantea preference have an intermediate host preference, whereas females have a strong host preference to S. gigantea. In summary, we found that the host preference that produces host-associated mating is inherited nonadditively at a relatively small number of loci on autosomal genes. This mode of inheritance meets the assumptions of models of sympatric speciation, indicating that the host races could have evolved in sympatry.

**Isolation and identification of Asaia sp in Anopheles spp. mosquitoes collected from Iranian malaria settings: steps toward applying paratransgenic tools against malaria**

Rami, A; Raz, A; Zakeri, S; Djadid, ND. 2018

Background: In recent years, the genus Asaia (Rhodospirillales: Acetobacteraceae) has been isolated from different Anopheles species and presented as a promising tool to combat malaria. This bacterium has unique features such as presence in different organs of mosquitoes (midgut, salivary glands and reproductive organs) of female and male mosquitoes and vertical and horizontal transmission. These specifications lead to the possibility of introducing Asaia as a robust candidate for malaria vector control via paratransgenesis technology. Several studies have been performed on the microbiota of Anopheles mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in Iran and the Middle East to find a suitable candidate for controlling the malaria based on paratransgenesis approaches. The present study is the first report of isolation, biochemical and molecular characterization of the genus Asaia within five different Anopheles species which originated from different zoogeographical zones in the south, east, and north of Iran. Methods: Mosquitoes originated from field-collected and laboratory-reared colonies of five Anopheles spp. Adult mosquitoes were anesthetized; their midguts were isolated by dissection, followed by grinding the midgut contents which were then cultured in enrichment broth media and later in CaCO3 agar plates separately. Morphological, biochemical and physiological characterization were carried out after the appearance of colonies. For molecular confirmation, selected colonies were cultured, their DNAs were extracted and PCR was performed on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using specific newly designed primers. Results: Morphological, biochemical, physiological and molecular results indicated that all isolates are members of the genus Asaia. Conclusions: Contrary to previous opinions, our findings show that Asaia bacteria are present in both insectary-reared colonies and field-collected mosquitoes and can be isolated by simple and specific methods. Furthermore, with respect to the fact that we isolated Asaia within the different Anopheles specimens from distinct climatic and zoogeographical regions, it is promising and may be concluded that species of this genus can tolerate the complicated environmental conditions of the vector-borne diseases endemic regions. Therefore, it can be considered as a promising target in paratransgenesis and vector control programs. However, we suggest that introducing the new technologies such as next generation sequencing and robust in silico approaches may pave the way to find a unique biomarker for rapid and reliable differentiation of the Asaia species.

**Abiotic and Biotic Mortality Factors Affecting Asian Citrus Psyllid (Hemiptera: Liviidae) Demographics in Southern California**

Kistner, EJ; Melhem, N; Carpenter, E; Castillo, M; Hoddle, MS. 2016

Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is an invasive citrus pest in California that vectors a bacterium that causes the deadly citrus disease huanglongbing. From 2014-2015, 116 experimental D. citri cohorts were monitored to determine survivorship, life table parameters, and marginal rates of mortality of immature D. citri at three sites in Riverside County, CA. D. citri cohorts of similar to 200 eggs were established on potted Citrus volkameriana (Rutaceae) plants. Field deployed cohorts were protected with fine or coarse mesh enclosures, sticky barriers, or left unprotected. Egg through adult emergence rates were used to assess the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors on psyllid survivorship rates by life stage. Predation of immature D. citri by larvae of Allograpta sp. (Diptera: Syrphidae) and Chrysoperla sp. (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) comprised 86% of all observed predation mortality. When protected from all other arthropods, parasitism by Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) comprised 21% of the total marginal rate of immature D. citri mortality from September to November in 2014 and 2015. Overall, D. citri net reproductive rates were reduced by 55-95% when exposed to natural enemies, indicating the importance of the classical biological control agent, T. radiata, and generalist predators in reducing D. citri densities in urban areas of southern California.

**Reproductive isolation between sympatric races of pea aphids. I. Gene flow restriction and habitat choice**

Via, S. 1999

Determining the extent and causes of barriers to gene flow between genetically divergent populations or races of single species is an important complement to post facto analyses of the causes of reproductive isolation between recognized species. Sympatric populations of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, Homoptera: Aphididae) on alfalfa and red clover are highly genetically divergent and locally adapted. Here, hierarchical estimates of population structure based on F-st suggest that gene exchange between closely adjacent aphid populations on the two hosts is highly restricted relative to that among fields of the same host plant. Although these host-associated races are presently considered to be the same subspecies, they appear to be significantly reproductively isolated, suggesting incipient speciation. Habitat (host) choice was investigated as the first in a temporal series of factors that could reduce gene exchange between these sympatric populations. Field studies of winged colonists to newly planted fields of each host suggest pronounced habitat fidelity. This result was verified using replicated observations of the host choice behavior of different aphid genotypes for which the relative demographic performance on each host was known. These laboratory observations of behavior revealed a strong genetic correlation between habitat choice (or acceptance) and the relative performance in each habitat. Because mating occurs on the host plant, habitat choice in this system leads to assortative mating and is therefore a major cause of reproductive isolation between the sympatric pea aphid populations on alfalfa and clover. However, the extent of dispersal between hosts estimated from the field study of winged colonists (9-11%) is too great to be consistent with the genetic divergence estimated between the races. This suggests that barriers to gene flow other than host choice also exist, such as selection against migrants or **hybrid**s in the parental environments, **hybrid** sterility, or **hybrid** breakdown.

**Habitat avoidance: Overlooking an important aspect of host-specific mating and sympatric speciation?**

Forbes, AA; Fisher, J; Feder, JL. 2005

Understanding speciation requires discerning how reproductive barriers to gene flow evolve between previously interbreeding populations. Models of sympatric speciation for phytophagous insects posit that reproductive isolation can evolve in the absence of geographic isolation as a consequence of an insect shifting and ecologically adapting to a new host plant. One important adaptation contributing to sympatric differentiation is host-specific mating. When organisms mate in preferred habitats, a system of positive assortative mating is established that facilitates sympatric divergence. Models of host fidelity generally assume that host choice is determined by the aggregate effect of alleles imparting positive preferences for different plant species. But negative effect genes for avoiding nonnatal plants may also influence host use. Previous studies have shown that apple and hawthorn-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella flies use volatile compounds emitted from the surface of fruit as key chemosensory cues to recognize and distinguish between their host plants. Here, we report results from field trials indicating that in addition to preferring the odor of their natal fruit, apple and hawthorn flies, and their undescribed sister species infesting flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), also avoid the odors of nonnatal fruit. We discuss the implications of nonnatal fruit avoidance for the evolutionary dynamics and genetics of sympatric speciation. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role for habitat avoidance as a potential postmating, as well as prezygotic, barrier to gene flow.

**Interspecific Competition and Speciation in Endoparasitoids**

Hood, GR; Egan, SP; Feder, JL. 2012

Ecological speciation occurs when inherent reproductive barriers to gene flow evolve between populations as a result of divergent natural selection. Frequency dependent effects associated with intraspecific resource competition are thought to be one important source of divergent selection facilitating ecological speciation. Interspecific competition may also play an important role in promoting population divergence. Although evidence for interspecific competition in nature is ubiquitous, there is currently little empirical data supporting its role in the speciation process. Here, we discuss two general models in which interspecific competition among species can promote ecological speciation among populations within a species. In both models, interspecific competition is the source of divergent selection driving adaption to different portions of the resource distribution, generating ecological reproductive isolation from other conspecific populations. We propose that the biology of endoparasitoids that attack phytophagous insects make model systems for studying the role of interspecific competition in ecological speciation. We describe details for one such system, the community of endoparasitic braconid wasps attacking Rhagoletis fruit flies, as a potential model for investigating competitive speciation. We conclude by hypothesizing that a model in which interspecific competition forces an inferior competitor to alternative fly hosts may be a common theme contributing to parasitoid diversification in the Rhagoletis-parasitoid system.

**A rapidly evolved shift in life-history timing during ecological speciation is driven by the transition between developmental phases**

Powell, THQ; Nguyen, A; Xia, QW; Feder, JL; Ragland, GJ; Hahn, DA. 2020

For insect species in temperate environments, seasonal timing is often governed by the regulation of diapause, a complex developmental programme that allows insects to weather unfavourable conditions and synchronize their life cycles with available resources. Diapause development consists of a series of distinct phases including initiation, maintenance, termination and post-diapause development. The evolution of insect seasonal timing depends in part on how these phases of diapause development and post-diapause development interact to affect variation in phenology. Here, we dissect the physiological basis of a recently evolved phenological shift inRhagoletis pomonella(Diptera: Tephritidae), a model system for ecological divergence. A recently derived population ofR. pomonellashifted from specializing on native hawthorn fruit to earlier fruiting introduced apples, resulting in a 3-4 week shift in adult emergence timing. We tracked metabolic rates of individual flies across post-winter development to test which phases of development may act either independently or in combination to contribute to this recently evolved divergence in timing. Apple and hawthorn flies differed in a number of facets of their post-winter developmental trajectories. However, divergent adaptation in adult emergence phenology in these flies was due almost entirely to the end of the pupal diapause maintenance phase, with post-diapause development having a very small effect. The relatively simple underpinnings of variation in adult emergence phenology suggest that further adaptation to seasonal change in these flies for this trait might be largely due to the timing of diapause termination unhindered by strong covariance among different components of post-diapause development.

**The genus Drosophila is characterized by a large number of sibling species showing evolutionary significance**

Singh, BN. NA

Mayr (1942) defined sibling species as sympatric forms which are morphologically very similar or indistinguishable, but which possess specific biological characteristics and are reproductively isolated. Another term, cryptic species has also been used for such species. However, this concept changed later. Sibling species are as similar as twins. This category does not necessarily include phylogenetic siblings as members of a superspecies. Since the term sibling species was defined by Mayr, a large number of cases of sibling species pairs/groups have been reported and thus they are widespread in the animal kingdom. However, they seem to be more common in some groups such as insects. In insects, they have been reported in diptera, lepidoptera, coleoptera, orthoptera, hymenoptera and others. Sibling species are widespread among the dipteran insects and as such are well studied because some species are important medically (mosquitoes), genetically (Drosophila) and cytologically (Sciara and Chironomus). The well-studied classical pairs of sibling species in Drosophila are: D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, and D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Subsequently, a number of sibling species have been added to these pairs and a large number of other sibling species pairs/groups in different species groups of the genus Drosophila have been reported in literature. The present review briefly summarizes the cases of sibling species pairs/groups in the genus Drosophila with their evolutionary significance.

**Latitudinal Variation in Parasitoid Guild Composition and Parasitism Rates of North American Hawthorn Infesting Rhagoletis**

Rull, J; Wharton, R; Feder, JL; Guillen, L; Sivinski, J; Forbes, A; Aluja, M. 2009

Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations in North America have diverged by exploiting host plants with varying fruiting phenologies in environments that differ markedly in temperature and humidity. As a result, four genetically and ecologically distinct R. pomonella populations that display partial reproductive isolation have evolved. Host shifting by Rhagoletis and similar evolutionary histories could have had cascading effects across trophic levels, influencing the diversity and distribution of associated parasitoid guilds. To establish the basis for a future understanding of the possible effect of divergence in R. pomonella populations on the parasitoids attacking these flies, we surveyed parasitoids from five different species of hawthorns distributed over 15 states in Mexico and 2 states in the midwestern United States. Emerging parasitoids were identified, parasitism rates were calculated, and regional fly and parasitoid emergence schedules were determined. Parasitism rate, emergence schedules, Shannon-Weiner diversity indexes, and species accumulation curves were compared across three main geographical regions. Parasitism levels varied greatly among regions from an overall high of 27.2% in the United States to 5.5% in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) mountains of Mexico, to as low as 0.19% in the Eje Volcanico Trans Mexicano (EVTM). Shannon-Weiner diversity indexes showed that parasitoid species diversity was similar across the distribution range of R. pomonella in Mexico and the United States because of the fact that total parasitism was dominated by only two species, one of them recovered across the whole North American range of hawthorn infesting Rhagoletis. Nevertheless, eight parasitoids were found attacking R. pomonella in Mexico compared with only four collected in the United States. Only two diapausing parasitoid species were shared between the U.S. and Mexican R. pomonella populations: Utetes canaliculatus and Diachasmimorpha mellea. Interestingly, many subtropical parasitoid species, usually associated to flies in the subtropical genus Anastrepha, were recovered in the SMO in low numbers. The wide distribution of U. canaliculatus and D. mellea offers an ideal opportunity to test for a shared biogeography and co-evolution between fly and parasitoids. In this regard, one factor contributing to the success of U canaliculatus seems to be the wasp's ability to modulate its eclosion time to track regional variation in hawthorn fruiting phenology and host (i.e., fly larvae) availability. Both R. pomonella and U. canaliculatus from southern sites emerged later than insects from northern populations, mirroring seasonal differences in hawthorn fruiting times across Mexico and the United States. These results suggest that molecular studies and crossing experiments could show, as they have for Rhagoletis, recent speciation events for parasitoid species of Nearctic origin that were found to be ecologically tracking environmentally driven divergence of their tephritid hosts.

**Differences in morphological traits between two sibling species, Drosophila ananassae and D-pallidosa**

Vishalakshi, C; Singh, BN. 2008

Capturing the mechanisms of speciation that appear in the early stages of reproductive isolation has been of recent interest to evolutionary biologists. In the present study, we investigated interspecific variations in several morphological traits, the degree of crossability, productivity, and the sex ratio in 2 sibling species, Drosophila ananassae and D. pallidosa, and their **hybrid**s. The present species pair is unique due to the presence of strong sexual isolation and the absence of postmating barriers such as **hybrid** inviability or sterility. The 2 sibling species significantly differed in the following morphological traits: thorax length, sternopleural bristle number, wing length, wing-to-thorax ratio, sex comb tooth number, and ovariole number in males and females. Interspecific **hybrid**s also significantly differed from their parental species in all morphological traits. Further, the degree of crossability and productivity was greater with conspecific matings than with heterospecific matings. Moreover, we found no sex ratio distortion in interspecific **hybrid**s suggesting that there are fewer genetic incompatibilities between these 2 sibling species. These results are interpreted in terms of the evolutionary divergence between D. ananassae and its sibling species, D. pallidosa.

**Differences in timing of mating swarms in sympatric populations of Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae s.s. (formerly An. gambiae M and S molecular forms) in Burkina Faso, West Africa**

Sawadogo, SP; Costantini, C; Pennetier, C; Diabate, A; Gibson, G; Dabire, RK. 2013

Background: The M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles appear to have speciated in West Africa and the M form is now formally named An. coluzzii Coetzee & Wilkerson sp.n. and the S form retains the nominotypical name (abbreviated here to An. gambiae). Reproductive isolation is thought to be the main barrier to **hybrid**isation; even though both species are found in the same mating swarms, **hybrid** fertilisations in copulae have not been found in the study area. The aim of the study, therefore, was to determine whether differences in circadian and/or environmental control over the timing of swarming in the two species contribute to reproductive isolation. Methods: The timing of male swarming in these species was recorded four nights per month over four years at five swarming sites in each of two villages. The timing of the start and end of swarming, and the concurrent environmental parameters, temperature, humidity and light intensity, were recorded for n = 20 swarms/month/species. The timing of 'spontaneous' activity at dusk of individual An. coluzzii and An. gambiae males was video-recorded in an actograph outdoors for 21 nights. Results: Of the environmental parameters considered, swarming was most strongly correlated with sunset (r(2) > 0.946). Anopheles gambiae started and stopped swarming earlier than An. coluzzii (3:35 +/- 0:68 min:sec and 4:51 +/- 1:21, respectively), and the mean duration of swarming was 23:37 +/- 0:33 for An. gambiae and 21:39 +/- 0:33 for An. coluzzii. Accordingly, in principle, whenever both species swarm over the same marker, a mean of 15.3 +/- 3.1% of An. gambiae swarming would occur before An. coluzzii males arrived, and 19.5 +/- 4.55% of An. coluzzii swarming would occurred after An. gambiae males had stopped swarming. These results are consistent with the finding that An. gambiae males became active in the actograph 09:35 +/- 00:22 min:sec earlier than An. coluzzii males. Conclusions: The timing of swarming and spontaneous activity at dusk are primarily under circadian control, with the phase linked closely to sunset throughout the year. The mating activity of these two species is temporally segregated for 15-20% of the swarming period, which may contribute to the observed reproductive isolation of these species in local sympatric populations.

**Sexual and natural selection on pollen morphology in Taraxacum**

Lynn, A; Piotter, E; Harrison, E; Galen, C. 2020

Premise Spiny pollen has evolved independently in multiple entomophilous lineages. Sexual selection may act on exine traits that facilitate male mating success by influencing the transfer of pollen from the anther to the body of the pollinator, while natural selection acts to increase pollen survival. We postulated that relative to sexual congeners, apomictic dandelions undergo relaxed selection on traits associated with male mating success. Methods We explored sexual selection on exine traits by measuring the propensity for Taraxacum spp. pollen to attach to hairs of flower-visiting bumblebees (Bombus spp.) or flies (Diptera: Syrphidae and Muscoidea) and assessed natural selection by testing whether pollen traits defend against consumption. Results Pollen picked up by bumblebees exhibited a narrower subset of spine-spacing phenotypes, consistent with stabilizing selection. Flies picked up larger pollen from flowers than expected at random. Surveys of corbiculae (pollen basket) contents from foraging bumblebees and feces of flies showed that pollen grains consumed by both kinds of visitors are similar in spine characteristics and size to those produced by the donor. When bees visit inflorescences of apomictic T. officinale, they pick up pollen with spine-spacing phenotypes above the mean and shifted toward those of sexual T. ceratophorum. Conclusions We demonstrate that traits under sexual selection during pollen pickup vary among pollinators, while natural selection for pollen defense is nil in T. ceratophorum. In **hybrid** zones between apomictic and sexual dandelions, pollen traits place apomictic donors at a dispersal disadvantage, potentially reinforcing reproductive isolation.

**Reproductive biology of the andromonoecious shrub Trevoa quinquenervia (Rhamnaceae)**

Medan, D; D'Ambrogio, AC. 1998

Various aspects of the reproductive biology of the andromonoecious shrub Trevoa quinquenervia Gill. &. Hook. were studied in a population located in central Chile. Flowering extends from mid August to the end of December. The small, white, entomophilous flowers are incompletely protandrous and last c. 5 days. A weak, pleasant odour along with nectar and pollen attracts 17 diurnal insect species, seven of which are probable pollinators: these include Diptera (Syrphidae and Bombyliidae), Hymenoptera (Apidae and Colletidae) and Coleoptera (Melyridae). Besides perfect flowers T. quinquenervia individuals possess c. 10% staminate flowers, which are lighter, seem to he shorter-lived, and show a smaller gynoecium with abnormal ovules. Reproduction is exclusively sexual and apparently xenogamous, with pollen transfer depending on insect vectors. Although flower morphology and individual flower phenology do not fully prevent self-pollination land geitonogamy can easily take place) the level of autogamy is low. Therefore, some self-incompatibility mechanism seems operative in this species. Fruit set of open-pollinated flowers is 6.6%, and ripe fruits contain on average 0.66 viable seeds. Predispersal (maternal) reproductive success (percent ovules becoming viable seeds) is 1.45%. For medium to full-sized individuals this corresponds to c. 2600 to 8600 potential offspring per year. Beyond the production of male flowers, four other aspects of the species' reproductive biology seem directed to enhance pollen export, partly implying increased male allocation: (a) a high pollen:ovule ratio, (b) protection of anthers against pollen-robbing by means of the cucullate petals, (c) secondary pollen presentation in a hairy barrier located above the nectary, and (d) a reduction in female allocation achieved by the regular abortion of two out of the three ovules in each ovary, thus producing a mostly one-seeded fruit provided with a thin, energy-poor pericarp. It is proposed that the advantages of enhanced pollen flow for a self-incompatible organism, which is moreover structured in isolated populations: might explain the increased male effort, including the joint evolution of andromonoecy and one-seededness.

**Phylogeography and recent emergence of the Old World screwworm fly, Chrysomya bezziana, based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences**

Ready, PD; Testa, JM; Wardhana, AH; Al-Izzi, M; Khalaj, M; Hall, MJR. 2009

A previous study had identified an African and an Asian race of the Old World screwworm fly, Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve (Diptera: Calliphoridae), based on the 3' terminal 279 basepairs (bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The Current study improved the phylogeographic resolution of cytochrome b for this species by characterizing more of the gene (the 3' terminal 715 bp) and by sampling more geographical populations, including Oman, Iran, Hong Kong and the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and East Sumba. Strong support was found for recognizing all African race, but not for a monophyletic Asian race. The cladistic and genealogical relationships among the Asian populations were complex. There was sufficient genetic homogeneity throughout separate regions (mainland Asia and each Indonesian island) to suggest that there are no reproductive barriers within each region that might necessitate the production of more than one strain for control by the sterile insect technique (SIT). Primers were designed for the amplification by polymerase chain reaction of two nuclear loci, the highly conserved elongation factor-1 alpha gene and the less conserved white gene, and the preliminary results indicated that these genes showed the same pattern of small-scale regional variation as cytochrome b. The cytochrome b haplotypes are useful markers for identifying the geographical origins of any emerging infestations of the species: the absence of Indonesian and African haplotypes in the Middle East demonstrates that the large-scale transport of livestock is not spreading Old World screwworm.

**Timing strains of the marine insect Clunio marinus diverged and persist with gene flow**

Kaiser, TS; von Haeseler, A; Tessmar-Raible, K; Heckel, DG. 2021

Genetic divergence of populations in the presence of gene flow is a central theme in speciation research. Theory predicts that divergence can happen with full range overlap - in sympatry - driven by ecological factors, but there are few empirical examples of how ecologically divergent selection can overcome gene flow and lead to reproductive isolation. In the marine midge Clunio marinus (Diptera: Chironomidae) reproduction is ecologically restricted to the time of the lowest tides, which is ensured through accurate control of development and adult emergence by circalunar and circadian clocks. As tidal regimes differ along the coastline, locally adapted timing strains of C. marinus are found in different sites across Europe. At the same time, ecologically suitable low tides occur at both full and new moon and twice a day, providing C. marinus with four nonoverlapping temporal niches at every geographic location. Along the coast of Brittany, which is characterized by a steep gradient in timing of the tides, we found an unusually large number of differentially adapted timing strains, and the first known instances of sympatric C. marinus strains occupying divergent temporal niches. Analysis of mitochondrial genotypes suggests that these timing strains originated from a single recent colonization event. Nuclear genotypes show strong gene flow, sympatric timing strains being the least differentiated. Even when sympatric strains exist in nonoverlapping temporal niches, timing adaptations do not result in genome-wide genetic divergence, suggesting timing adaptations are maintained by permanent ecological selection. This constitutes a model case for incipient ecological divergence with gene flow.

**Predicting the occurrence of host-associated differentiation in parasitic arthropods: a quantitative literature review**

Harrison, K; Tarone, AM; DeWitt, T; Medina, RF. 2022

Parasite populations associated with different host species can encounter a variety of isolating reproductive barriers, leading to each population independently accumulating genome-wide genetic differences due to their host associations. This phenomenon is called host-associated differentiation (HAD) and has been proposed as an indicator of early diversification among parasitic arthropods. Although many parasite-host case study systems have been tested for the genetic signature of HAD (e.g., F-ST >= 0.15 between sympatric, host-associated populations in the absence of allopatry), it is unknown which isolating reproductive barriers best predict the general occurrence of HAD. HAD development has been attributed to biological and ecological factors that either directly generate reproductive isolation between parasites living on different hosts, such as 'immigrant inviability' (i.e., lower fitness of immigrants in non-native environments), or that promote the accumulation of host-specific genetic adaptations, such as the gallmaking feeding mode. In fact, some of these factors are shared across multiple case studies, suggesting that the occurrence of HAD is generalizable and can be predicted based on the incidence of significant biological and ecological factors. By means of a discriminant function analysis (DFA), this research assessed 108 arthropod parasite-host case studies for ecological and biological factors significantly correlated with the occurrence of HAD and whether these factors could be used to distinguish the presence of HAD from its absence. The DFA demonstrated that case studies that developed HAD could be distinguished from case studies that did not develop HAD. The results of the DFA were corroborated by a 'non-iterative partial least squares' (NIPALS) discriminant model and a nominal logistic regression. Case studies with HAD could be robustly separated from case studies without HAD based on the incidence of these predictive factors: immigrant inviability, gallmaking, endophagy, recent range invasions of either hosts or parasites, differential host phenology, and differential parasite morphology. These results were used in an infinite random forest analysis to generate a hierarchy of conditional probabilities that separated HAD presence from absence. The results provide researchers with a tool for reliably predicting which untested parasite-host system would likely develop HAD. Immigrant inviability, gallmaking, and their combination were strongly correlated with the presence of HAD, which indicated parasite-host systems with these traits were highly likely to develop HAD. Contrary to expectation, endophagous feeding was negatively correlated with HAD presence, which indicated phytophagous endophagous feeders (excepting gallmakers) were highly unlikely to develop HAD. Furthermore, parasitoids were shown to be just as likely to develop HAD as not. Unfortunately, potentially significant predictive factors (e.g., allochrony) were excluded from analysis because too few case studies have been specifically tested for these factors. Furthermore, this analysis was biased by the lack of 'negative' publication results and the overrepresentation of research laboratories that primarily study HAD. Future research should accumulate novel HAD case studies that specifically test for allochrony, differential microbial associations, and morphological differentiation.

**ULTRASTRUCTURAL DIVERSITY IN THE EGG CHORION OF HAWAIIAN DROSOPHILA AND SCAPTOMYZA - ECOLOGICAL AND PHYLOGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS**

KAMBYSELLIS, MP. 1993

Formation of the egg shell (chorion) in Drosophila and Scaptomyza (Diptera : Drosophilidae) is a complex developmental process involving coordinated synthesis and secretion of multiple proteins by the monolayer of follicle cells surrounding the egg. Using scanning electron microscopy, the ultrastructure of the chorion in 37 endemic Hawaiian drosophilids, representing the genera Drosophila and Scaptomyza, were analyzed and compared with 7 representative species of continental Drosophila. The detailed structure of the chorion was described for 8 chorionic regions: the respiratory filaments, follicle imprints, operculum, micropyle, dorsal ridge, ventral rim, posterior pole, and the chorion cross-section. The morphology of each region is similar among related species, but strikingly different among groups. The main functions of the chorion are to protect the developing embryo from the vicissitudes of the environment and to provide channels for gas exchange during embryogenesis. Adaptation to the diverse ovipositional substrates used by Drosophila in general, and the Hawaiian species in particular, has resulted in extraordinary diversity in the various chorionic structures. The respiratory filaments differ in number and have evolved to different lengths and degrees of porosity. Furthermore, other regions also involved in respiratory exchange (the operculum, follicle imprints, the pole region, and the dorsal ridge) have diverged in parallel to the ecological divergence. The thickness and complexity of the outer endochorion are dramatically different in various groups, providing varying degrees of mechanical strength to the eggshell, which promotes embryonic survival in the diverse microenvironments. These varied chorionic structures have been found to provide useful morphological characters for phylogenetic analyses of the drosophilids.

**Susceptibility to ecological traps is similar among closely related taxa but sensitive to spatial isolation**

Robertson, BA; Keddy-Hector, IA; Shrestha, SD; Silverberg, LY; Woolner, CE; Hetterich, I; Horvath, G. 2018

Ecological traps are maladaptive behavioural scenarios in which animals prefer to settle in habitats with the lowest survival and/or reproductive success. Aquatic insect species, for example, are attracted to sources of horizontally polarized light associated with natural water bodies, but today they commonly prefer to lay their eggs upon asphalt roads and buildings that reflect an unnaturally high percentage of polarized light. Ecological traps are a rapidly emerging threat to the persistence of animal populations, but the degree to which species vary in their susceptibility to them remains uninvestigated. We designed a field experiment to (1) assess the relative susceptibility of aquatic flies (Diptera) to a single maladaptive behavioural cue: variation in degree of horizontally polarized light (d), and (2) quantify how the isolation of an ecological trap from a high-quality habitat affects its relative attractiveness. We exposed wild dipterans to experimental test surfaces varying in d at three distances from natural streams and mapped behavioural reaction norms of habitat preference as a function of d and distance from high-quality habitat. All seven of the dipteran families were captured most in traps with progressively higher d values, especially those (d = 90-100%) that exceeded that of natural water bodies (30-80%). In most taxa, the height and slope of numerical responses to d were influenced by the distance of an ecological trap from a natural water body. Our results illustrate that dipterans have broadly evolved the use of a habitat selection behaviour that treats more strongly polarized light sources as indicative higher-quality habitats, making them broadly susceptible to ecological traps driven by polarized light pollution. We also found that the spatial isolation of ecological traps from higher-quality, but less attractive, habitats can either increase or reduce species' susceptibility to them.

**Testing the potential contribution of Wolbachia to speciation when cytoplasmic incompatibility becomes associated with host-related reproductive isolation**

Bruzzese, DJ; Schuler, H; Wolfe, TM; Glover, MM; Mastroni, JV; Doellman, MM; Tait, C; Yee, WL; Rull, J; Aluja, M; Hood, GR; Goughnour, RB; Stauffer, C; Nosil, P; Feder, JL. NA

Endosymbiont-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) may play an important role in arthropod speciation. However, whether CI consistently becomes associated or coupled with other host-related forms of reproductive isolation (RI) to impede the transfer of endosymbionts between **hybrid**izing populations and further the divergence process remains an open question. Here, we show that varying degrees of pre- and post-mating RI exist among allopatric populations of two interbreeding cherry-infesting tephritid fruit flies (Rhagoletis cingulata and R. indifferens) across North America. These flies display allochronic and sexual isolation among populations, as well as unidirectional reductions in egg hatch in **hybrid** crosses involving southwestern USA males. All populations are infected by a Wolbachia strain, wCin2, whereas a second strain, wCin3, only co-infects flies from the southwest USA and Mexico. Strain wCin3 is associated with a unique mitochondrial DNA haplotype and unidirectional postmating RI, implicating the strain as the cause of CI. When coupled with nonendosymbiont RI barriers, we estimate the strength of CI associated with wCin3 would not prevent the strain from introgressing from infected southwestern to uninfected populations elsewhere in the USA if populations were to come into secondary contact and **hybrid**ize. In contrast, cytoplasmic-nuclear coupling may impede the transfer of wCin3 if Mexican and USA populations were to come into contact. We discuss our results in the context of the general paucity of examples demonstrating stable Wolbachia **hybrid** zones and whether the spread of Wolbachia among taxa can be constrained in natural **hybrid** zones long enough for the endosymbiont to participate in speciation.

**Acetic Acid Bacteria, Newly Emerging Symbionts of Insects**

Crotti, E; Rizzi, A; Chouaia, B; Ricci, I; Favia, G; Alma, A; Sacchi, L; Bourtzis, K; Mandrioli, M; Cherif, A; Bandi, C; Daffonchio, D. 2010

Recent research in microbe-insect symbiosis has shown that acetic acid bacteria (AAB) establish symbiotic relationships with several insects of the orders Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Homoptera, all relying on sugar-based diets, such as nectars, fruit sugars, or phloem sap. To date, the fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster and Bactrocera oleae, mosquitoes of the genera Anopheles and Aedes, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus, and the mealybug Saccharicoccus sacchari have been found to be associated with the bacterial genera Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter, Gluconobacter, Asaia, and Saccharibacter and the novel genus Commensalibacter. AAB establish symbiotic associations with the insect midgut, a niche characterized by the availability of diet-derived carbohydrates and oxygen and by an acidic pH, selective factors that support AAB growth. AAB have been shown to actively colonize different insect tissues and organs, such as the epithelia of male and female reproductive organs, the Malpighian tubules, and the salivary glands. This complex topology of the symbiosis indicates that AAB possess the keys for passing through body barriers, allowing them to migrate to different organs of the host. Recently, AAB involvement in the regulation of innate immune system homeostasis of Drosophila has been shown, indicating a functional role in host survival. All of these lines of evidence indicate that AAB can play different roles in insect biology, not being restricted to the feeding habit of the host. The close association of AAB and their insect hosts has been confirmed by the demonstration of multiple modes of transmission between individuals and to their progeny that include vertical and horizontal transmission routes, comprising a venereal one. Taken together, the data indicate that AAB represent novel secondary symbionts of insects.

**Hybridization and sequential components of reproductive isolation between parapatric walnut-infesting sister species Rhagoletis completa and Rhagoletis?zoqui**

Rull, J; Tadeo, E; Aluja, M; Guillen, L; Egan, SP; Feder, JL. 2012

**Hybrid**ization can provide a window into how populations diverge to form new species. Here, we confirm **hybrid**ization between Rhagoletis completa Cresson, 1929 and Rhagoletis zoqui Bush, 1966, two species of walnut husk-infesting flies that geographically overlap in a narrow area of parapatry in Northeastern Mexico. Rhagoletis completa and R.?zoqui are members of a species group (Rhagoletis suavis) that has been hypothesized to speciate in allopatry. Sexual selection has been argued to be a potentially important factor for generating pre-mating isolation among walnut husk flies, because of the differences in wing morphology and body coloration, and the existence of sexual dimorphism within species. However, there was no evidence for pre-mating isolation between R.?completa and R.?zoqui, based on choice and no-choice mating experiments conducted on adults of fly populations outside the contact zone. There was also no support for reduced fertility of **hybrid** matings or for F1 inviability; however, F1 **hybrid**s appeared to have lower fertility and F2 offspring have reduced survivorship. Postzygotic isolation in later generation **hybrid**s of mixed ancestry therefore appears to be the first intrinsic barrier to gene flow evolving between R.?completa and R.?zoqui. We discuss the implications of our results for allopatric speciation in walnut flies and the potential evolutionary fate of R.?zoqui and R.?completa if they were to come into broad geographic contact in the future.

**Bridges and barriers to host shifts resulting from host plant genotypic variation**

Craig, TP; Itami, JK; Ohgushi, T; Ando, Y; Utsumi, S. 2011

Host-associated differentiation is hypothesized to be one of the primary means by which new species of herbivorous insects evolve. Divergent selection for host plant use following a host shift is a critical assumption of host-associated differentiation. Host shifts are more likely to occur between closely related host species, and the probability of a host shift and of the evolution of reproductive isolation depends on the genetic variation within both the host plant population and the herbivorous insect. We have been studying the evolution of reproductive isolation in populations of Eurosta solidaginis that form galls on Solidago altissima altissima and Solidago altissima gilvocanescens. Each of the Eurosta populations is a host race that is partially but incompletely isolated from the other host races by its adaptation to its host plants. The Solidago sp. populations show high intraspecific variation within and among populations in their resistance to attack by the host races which are adapted to them. There is also evidence that they vary in their susceptibility to host races adapted to other Solidago species. We examine the hypothesis that the intraspecific Solidago variation determines the degree of gene flow among Eurosta populations and that this can create barriers or bridges to gene flow and therefore determine the course of speciation in these insects. The intraspecific host plant variation can influence the interactions with herbivores when it is an invasive species. The restricted range of genetic variation introduced into a new region may be a good or poor match with populations of herbivores that are also introduced into the new area.

**Floral-like destiny induced by a galling Cecidomyiidae on the axillary buds of Marcetia taxifolia (Melastomataceae)**

Ferreira, BG; Isaias, RMD. 2014

The galls induced by Cecidomyiidae, Diptera, are very diverse, with conspicuous evidence of tissue manipulation by the galling herbivores. Bud galls, as those induced by an unidentified Cecidomyiidae species on Marcetia taxifolia, Melastomataceae, can be considered as one of the most complex type of prosoplasma galls. The gall-inducer manipulate the axillary meristem of the plant in a way that gall morphogenesis may present both vegetative and reproductive features of the host plant. Herein, we analyzed traces of determinate and indeterminate growth in the bud gall of M. taxifolia, looking for parallels between the features,of the leaves and flowers, natural fates of the meristematic cells. The bud galls are induced by the cecidomyiid fly, and are formed by the connation of eight leaf primordia, a common process in ovary morphogenesis. The bud gall corresponds to a pistil-shaped gall morphotype, with anatomical features similar to those of an hypanthium and sepals. The gall mimics an ovary, which has protective barriers at the apex, and a nutritive tissue (with storage of lipids and proteins) or a placenta, respectively, at the basal portion. The redifferentiation of the promeristem into a nutritive tissue at the base of the gall confers a determinate destiny to the axillary bud. Comparatively, the gradients of cell expansion and of accumulation of primary metabolites also indicate that the gall and the ovary are convergent structures. Some constraints of the host plant cells, such as the absence of lignification, and the accumulation of polyphenols, lipids and terpenoids, are not altered and may confer chemical protection for plant tissues and the larva against oxidative stress.

**Strain- and sex-specific differences in daily flight activity and the circadian clock of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes**

Rund, SSC; Lee, SJ; Bush, BR; Duffield, GE. 2012

Anopheles gambiae, the primary African malaria vector, is currently speciating into two incipient species, the so-called "molecular forms" M and S. While some geographic areas may contain only one form, in many areas both forms are found coexisting, but reproductively isolated. It appears that spatial segregation of mating swarms may contribute significantly to reproductive isolation as in many locales single-form swarms exist almost exclusively even though they are in close geographic proximity. The mechanism causing this spatial segregation is not well understood. Here, we compare the locomotor flight activity of M and S form male and female An. gambiae mosquitoes with the goal of identifying potential strain-specific temporal differences that could potentially serve as a mating barrier. We use an infrared beam break method to monitor flight activity of individual mosquitoes with a minute-to-minute time resolution under both LD cycle and constant dark conditions. We compare daily total flight activity, activity onset, peak in early nocturnal activity, the build up of dusk-related activity, and the free-running circadian period length. Our investigations revealed strain- and sex-specific differences in total daily activity. In both forms, males commenced nightly flight activity earlier than females, and this corresponded with a significantly shorter circadian period length in males compared to females. We note strain-specific differences in this response to dusk as males of the M form have a pronounced build up in flight activity relative to the S form males prior to complete darkness. This is likely driven by a differential response to the decreasing light intensity at dusk. We hypothesize that this behavioral difference could be a temporal factor contributing to the assembly of single-form swarms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

**Mating compatibility among populations of codling moth Cydia pomonella Linnaeus (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) from different geographic origins**

Taret, G; Sevilla, M; Wornoayporn, V; Islam, A; Ahmad, S; Caceres, C; Robinson, AS; Vreysen, MJB. 2010

The codling moth Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is a serious pest of pome fruit worldwide and the sterile insect technique (SIT) provides an environmentally acceptable approach for its control. As the pest is present in both the southern and northern hemispheres it would be possible for a rearing facility in the northern hemisphere to supply sterile moths to an SIT programme in the southern hemisphere during the northern winter and vice versa. This could greatly improve the economics of moth production and the running costs of rearing facilities. However in order to develop this concept, it is important to assess if populations of codling moth from different geographical regions share mating compatibility. Twelve different laboratory and field populations from both hemispheres were sampled and field cage bisexual mating compatibility tests were carried out between selected combinations. The index of sexual isolation (ISI) and the female and male relative performance index (FRPI and MRPI, respectively) were calculated for each mating combination. In only two of the combinations was there a slight but significant deviation from random mating. There were also some significant differences in mating duration between the homotypic matings and the duration of a particular homotypic mating seemed to depend on the origin of the other population in the cage. It was concluded that there exist no barriers to mating between populations of codling moth from many parts of the world and that it would be feasible for sterile moths to be shipped from one rearing facility to SIT programmes in other parts of the world.

**It's about time: the evidence for host plant-mediated selection in the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, and its implications for fitness trade-offs in phytophagous insects**

Feder, JL; Filchak, KE. 1999

The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, Walsh (Diptera: Tephritidae), provides a unique opportunity to address the issue of host-related fitness trade-offs for phytophagous insects. Rhagoletis pomonella has been controversial since the 1860's when Benjamin Walsh cited the fly's shift from hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) to apple (Malus pumila) as an example of an incipient sympatric speciation event. Allozyme and mark-release-recapture studies have subsequently confirmed the status of apple and hawthorn flies as partially reproductively isolated and genetically differentiated 'host races', the hypothesized initial stage in sympatric divergence. Here, we review the ecological and genetic evidence for host-plant mediated selection in R. pomonella. We reach the following three major conclusions: First, although developmental timing is not everything, it is a good deal of the story. Differences in the fruiting phenologies of apple and hawthorn trees exert different selection pressures on the diapause and eclosion time characteristics of the host races. In particular, the similar to 3-week earlier mean fruiting phenology of apples in eastern North America appears to select for a slower rate of metabolism or deeper pupal diapause in apple than hawthorn flies. Second, host-related fitness trade-offs for R. pomonella may not be due to disruptive selection affecting any one specific life-history stage. Rather, it is the sum total of directional selection pressures acting across different life-stages that generates divergent selection on apple and hawthorn flies. For example, selection favors the alleles Me 100, Acon-2 95 and Mpi 37 (or linked genes) in the larval stage in both host races. However, these same alleles are disfavored in the pupal stage to follow, where they correlate with early adult eclosion, and by inference premature diapause termination. Because apple trees fruit an average of similar to 3 weeks earlier than hawthorn trees, this counter-balancing selection is stronger on apple-fly pupae. The net result is that the balance of selective forces is different between apple and hawthorn flies, helping to maintain the genetic integrity of the host races in sympatry in the face of gene flow. Finally, natural R. pomonella populations harbor a good deal of genetic variation for development-related traits. This variation allows fly populations to rapidly respond to temporal vagaries in local environmental conditions across years, as well as to broad-scale geographic differences that exist across the range of the species. Perhaps most importantly, this variation gives R. pomonella the flexibility to explore and adapt to novel plants. Taken together, our results underscore how difficult it can be to document host plant-related fitness trade-offs for phytophagous insects due to the need to consider details of the entire life-cycle of a phytophagous insect. Our findings also show how reproductive isolation can arise as a by-product of host-associated adaptation in insects, a central theme for models of sympatric speciation via host shifts.

**Asymmetric reproductive isolation and interference in neriid flies: the roles of genital morphology and behaviour**

Bath, E; Tatarnic, N; Bonduriansky, R. 2012

The processes underlying reproductive isolation, and the traits involved, are the subject of considerable debate in evolutionary biology. Studying the costly sexual interaction of species in secondary sympatry, a phenomenon known as reproductive interference, can help to shed light on past and present isolating mechanisms, as well as the implications of sympatry for individual fitness. We investigated the roles of two sets of traits, genitalic and behavioural, in reproductive isolation and interference in two species of Australian neriid flies, Telostylinus lineolatus and T. angusticollis. Surprisingly, although these species differ markedly in male but not in female genitalia, we found evidence that genital morphology resulted in asymmetric reproductive isolation: T. lineolatus males could transfer sperm to T. angusticollis females, but T. angusticollis males were unable to transfer sperm to T. lineolatus females. However, neither type of cross produced any viable **hybrid**s. Behavioural responses also contributed asymmetrically to both reproductive isolation and reproductive interference. Males pursued both conspecific and heterospecific females. Females of both species discriminated against heterospecific males, but T. lineolatus females exhibited stronger discrimination than T. angusticollis females. Curiously, T. angusticollis males both fought and attempted to copulate with T. lineolatus males, resulting in reduced mating success for T. angusticollis males with conspecific females. Our findings show that both genitalic and behavioural traits can play important roles in reproductive isolation, but the consequences of interspecific divergence in these traits can be surprisingly complex, resulting in asymmetric effects on many aspects of interspecific interactions.

**Reproductive Isolations of Anopheles sinensis from Anopheles lesteri and Anopheles sineroides in Korea**

Park, MH; Choochote, W; Junkum, A; Joshi, D; Tuetan, B; Saeung, A; Jung, JH; Min, GS. 2008

Three species of iso-female lines of Korean anophelines (Anopheles sinensis, An. lesteri, and An. sineroides) were identified based on combinative diagnostic characteristics of morphology, metaphase karyotypes, crossing experiments, and comparison of DNA sequences of ribosomal DNA Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and further analyzed to determine their genetic relationships. Upon comparison of the F-1-**hybrid**s with those of their parent species as the control, differences in viabilities were observed. The viability of F-1-**hybrid**s with high larval mortalities, the failure of all pupae to emerge as adults, and the F-1-**hybrid**'s salivary gland polytene chromosomes showing complete asynapsis of all arms from the crosses between An. sinensis and An. lesteri, as well as An. sinensis and An. sineroides, suggested that these three cryptic species exhibited signs of an entirely reproductive isolation.

**Genetic differentiation associated with host plants and geography among six widespread species of South American Blepharoneura fruit flies (Tephritidae)**

Ottens, K; Winkler, IS; Lewis, ML; Scheffer, SJ; Gomes-Costa, GA; Condon, MA; Forbes, AA. 2017

Tropical herbivorous insects are astonishingly diverse, and many are highly host-specific. Much evidence suggests that herbivorous insect diversity is a function of host plant diversity; yet, the diversity of some lineages exceeds the diversity of plants. Although most species of herbivorous fruit flies in the Neotropical genus Blepharoneura are strongly host-specific (they deposit their eggs in a single host plant species and flower sex), some species are collected from multiple hosts or flowers and these may represent examples of lineages that are diversifying via changes in host use. Here, we investigate patterns of diversification within six geographically widespread Blepharoneura species that have been collected and reared from at least two host plant species or host plant parts. We use microsatellites to (1) test for evidence of local genetic differentiation associated with different sympatric hosts (different plant species or flower sexes) and (2) examine geographic patterns of genetic differentiation across multiple South American collection sites. In four of the six fly species, we find evidence of local genetic differences between flies collected from different hosts. All six species show evidence of geographic structure, with consistent differences between flies collected in the Guiana Shield and flies collected in Amazonia. Continent-wide analyses reveal - in all but one instance - that genetically differentiated flies collected in sympatry from different host species or different sex flowers are not one another's closest relatives, indicating that genetic differences often arise in allopatry before, or at least coincident with, the evolution of novel host use.

**High divergence of reproductive tract proteins and their association with postzygotic reproductive isolation in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis group species**

Civetta, A; Singh, RS. 1995

The possible association between gonadal protein divergence and postzygotic reproductive isolation was investigated among species of the Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis groups. Protein divergence was scored by high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Close to 500 protein spots from gonadal tissues (testis and ovary) and nongonadal tissues (malpighian tubules and brain) were analyzed and protein divergence was calculated based on presence vs absence. Both testis and ovary proteins showed higher divergence than nongonadal proteins, and also a highly significant positive correlation with postzygotic reproductive isolation but a weaker correlation with prezygotic reproductive isolation. Particularly, a positive and significant correlation was found between proteins expressed in the testis and postzygotic reproductive isolation among closely related species such as the within-phylad species in the D. virilis group. The high levels of male-reproductive-tract protein divergence between species might be associated with F-1 **hybrid** male sterility among closely related species. If so, a lower level of ovary protein divergence should be expected on the basis that F-1 female **hybrid**s are fully fertile. However, this is not necessarily true if relatively few genes are responsible for the reproductive isolation observed between closely related species, as recent studies seem to suggest. We suggest that the faster rate of evolution of gonadal proteins in comparison to nongonadal proteins and the association of that rate with postzygotic reproductive isolation may be the result of episodic and/or sexual selection on male and female molecular traits.

**Unveiling mosquito cryptic species and their reproductive isolation**

Zheng, XL. 2020

Mosquitoes are major vectors of many infectious pathogens or parasites. Understanding cryptic species and the speciation of disease vectors has important implications for vector management, evolution and host-pathogen and/or host-parasite interactions. Currently, mosquito cryptic species have been reported in many studies, most of which focus on the reproductive isolation of cryptic species and mainly onAnopheles gambiaesensu lato complex. Emerging species within the primary malaria vectorAnopheles gambiaeshow different ecological preferences and significant prezygotic reproductive isolation, whileAedes mariaeandAedes zammitiishow postmating reproductive isolation. However, data reporting the reproductive isolation inCulexandAedes albopictusmosquito cryptic species is absent. The lack of systematic studies leaves many questions open, such as whether cryptic species are more common in particular habitats, latitudes or taxonomic groups; what mosquito cryptic species evolutionary processes bring about reproductive isolation in the absence of morphological differentiation? How does Wolbachia infection affect in mosquitoes' reproductive isolation? In this review, we provide a summary of recent advances in the discovery and identification of sibling or cryptic species within mosquito genera.

**An analysis of gene flow among Midwestern populations of the mosquito Ochlerotatus triseriatus**

Beck, ET; Bosio, CF; Geske, DA; Blair, CD; Beaty, BJ; Black, WC. 2005

A population genetics study of the mosquito Ochlerotatus triseriatus was performed on 36 collections from adjoining regions of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin covering approximately 120 km(2). Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was used to estimate variation in the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) gene. The heated oligonucleotide ligation assay was used to identify the ND4 haplotype of each mosquito. No evidence of genetic isolation by distance was found, nor did Interstate 90 or the Mississippi River serve as barriers to gene flow. The effective migration rate varied from 18 to 45 reproductive migrants/generation, which is similar to estimates from an earlier study. The collections belong to a single, large, panmictic population. However, within this panmictic population, local genetic drift arises, possibly due to one or a few females ovipositing in larval breeding containers. From generation to generation, there is sufficient gene flow to mix families arising from individual breeding sites and eliminate founder effects due to drift.

**Assessment of the ecologically dependent post-zygotic isolation between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae**

Niang, A; Sawadogo, SP; Dabire, RK; Tripet, F; Diabate, A. 2020

Within the Anopheles gambiae complex, the sibling species An. coluzzii and An. gambiae are undergoing sympatric speciation. These species are characterized by rare **hybrid**s in most of their geographical distribution. A strong assortative mating mediated by spatial swarm segregation has been shown whereas no intrinsic post-zygotic barriers have been found in laboratory conditions. To test the role of the **hybrid**isation in reproductive isolation in natural populations transplant experiment are therefore needed to establish the significance of post-zygotic barriers. Previous studies indicated that predation is one of the major forces driving ecological divergence between An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. Here we extended these studies to their **hybrid**s. Parental species and their F1 **hybrid**s from reciprocal crosses were generated by the forced-mating technique as follows: female An. coluzzii x male An. coluzzii; female An. coluzzii x male An. gambiae; female An. gambiae x male An. coluzzii and female An. gambiae x Male An. gambiae. First instar larvae of each group from the crossing (here after An. coluzzii, **Hybrid** COL/GAM, **Hybrid** GAM/COL and An. gambiae, respectively) were transplanted in a field experiment with predation effect. Emergence success, development time of larvae and body size of the newly emerging adults were estimated as fitness components and then compared between parental species and F1 **hybrid**s in absence and in presence of predators. Our findings confirm that An. coluzzii had higher fitness than An. gambiae in presence of predators versus in absence of predators. Moreover, the fitness of the F1 **hybrid** COL/GAM whose female parent was An. coluzzii matched that of An. coluzzii while that of the F1 reciprocal **hybrid** GAM/COL was similar to An. gambiae.

**Sexual isolation and mating propensity among allopatric Drosophila mettleri populations**

Castrezana, SJ; Markow, TA. 2008

Drosophila mettleri is found in deserts of North America breeding in soil soaked by the juices of necrotic cacti. Saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and cardon (Pachycereus pringlei) are the usual host cacti in Mexico and Arizona, while prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) is used by an isolated population on Santa Catalina Island off the southern California Coast. Populations of D. mettleri show significant local genetic differentiation, especially when geographical isolation is coupled with host shifts. We tested for evidence of sexual isolation among allopatric populations of D. mettleri using a variety of choice and no-choice tests. Populations exhibited significant differences in mating propensity, which translated into significant deviations from random mating. While in some cases these deviations were consistent with sexual isolation, in others, negative assortative mating was observed. No relationship between degree of genetic differentiation and the appearance of sexual isolation was detected.

**Sexual Selection, Epistasis and Species Boundaries in Sympatric Hawaiian Picture-winged Drosophila**

Price, DK; Souder, SK; Russo-Tait, T. 2014

The Hawaiian picture-winged flies in the genus Drosophila are a spectacular example of rapid evolutionary diversification in which sexual selection is considered an important mechanism for reproductive isolation and speciation. We investigated the behavioral reproductive isolation of two closely related and sympatric Hawaiian picture-winged Drosophila species, D. silvestris and D. heteroneura, which are known to **hybrid**ize in nature and produce viable and fertile **hybrid**s. We compared the mating success of parental, F1 and backcross males in pairings with D. heteroneura females. The F1 males were produced by mating D. heteroneura males with D. silvestris females, and the backcross males were produced by mating F1 females with D. heteroneura males. The mating success of backcross males paired with D. heteroneura females were significantly reduced relative to that of parental and F1 males. This reduced mating success occurred primarily at a late stage of courtship where female choice of mate may be important. Two- and three-gene models demonstrate that epistasis involving a few genes could account for the observed variation in male mating success. These results are consistent with negative epistasis in the backcross generation and support the importance of sexual selection and negative epistasis in the evolution and maintenance of these species.

**Divergent diapause life history timing drives both allochronic speciation and reticulate hybridization in an adaptive radiation of Rhagoletis flies**

Inskeep, KA; Doellman, MM; Powell, THQ; Berlocher, SH; Seifert, NR; Hood, GR; Ragland, GJ; Meyers, PJ; Feder, JL. NA

Divergent adaptation to new ecological opportunities can be an important factor initiating speciation. However, as niches are filled during adaptive radiations, trait divergence driving reproductive isolation between sister taxa may also result in trait convergence with more distantly related taxa, increasing the potential for reticulated gene flow across the radiation. Here, we demonstrate such a scenario in a recent adaptive radiation of Rhagoletis fruit flies, specialized on different host plants. Throughout this radiation, shifts to novel hosts are associated with changes in diapause life history timing, which act as "magic traits" generating allochronic reproductive isolation and facilitating speciation-with-gene-flow. Evidence from laboratory rearing experiments measuring adult emergence timing and genome-wide DNA-sequencing surveys supported allochronic speciation between summer-fruiting Vaccinium spp.-infesting Rhagoletis mendax and its hypothesized and undescribed sister taxon infesting autumn-fruiting sparkleberries. The sparkleberry fly and R. mendax were shown to be genetically discrete sister taxa, exhibiting no detectable gene flow and allochronically isolated by a 2-month average difference in emergence time corresponding to host availability. At sympatric sites across the southern USA, the later fruiting phenology of sparkleberries overlaps with that of flowering dogwood, the host of another more distantly related and undescribed Rhagoletis taxon. Laboratory emergence data confirmed broadly overlapping life history timing and genomic evidence supported on-going gene flow between sparkleberry and flowering dogwood flies. Thus, divergent phenological adaptation can drive the initiation of reproductive isolation, while also enhancing genetic exchange across broader adaptive radiations, potentially serving as a source of novel genotypic variation and accentuating further diversification.

**Evolution in the Drosophila ananassae species subgroup**

Matsuda, M; Ng, CS; Doi, M; Kopp, A; Tobari, YN. 2009

Drosophila ananassae and its relatives have many advantages as a model of genetic differentiation and speciation. In this report, we examine evolutionary relationships in the ananassae species subgroup using a multi-locus molecular data set, karyotypes, meiotic chromosome configuration, chromosomal inversions, morphological traits, and patterns of reproductive isolation. We describe several new taxa that are the closest known relatives of D. ananassae. Analysis of Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial haplotypes, shared chromosome arrangements, pre-mating isolation and **hybrid** male sterility suggests that these taxa represent a recent evolutionary radiation and may experience substantial gene flow. We discuss possible evolutionary histories of these species and give a formal description of one of them as D. parapallidosa Tobari sp. n. The comparative framework established by this study, combined with the recent sequencing of the D. ananassae genome, will facilitate future studies of reproductive isolation, phenotypic variation and genome evolution in this lineage.

**REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION BETWEEN FLORIDA STRAINS OF AEDES-AEGYPTI AND AEDES-ALBOPICTUS**

HARPER, JP; PAULSON, SL. 1994

The dynamics of heterospecific and conspecific mating between Florida strains of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus was examined. In nonchoice experiments where conspecific males were not available, dissection of the spermathecae showed that heterospecific insemination was an infrequent event for both species combinations (10.6% for Ae. albopictus with Ae. aegypti males, 3.6% for the reciprocal cross). Few eggs were produced from heterospecific crosses and all were nonviable. Frequency of heterospecific mating was not increased when the hindtarsi of females were removed, eliminating a significant mechanism for fending off unwanted courtship. When held with males of both species, females mated with conspecifics and oviposited without regard to the presence of heterospecifics. In low density experiments, a single female of either species caged with an excess of heterospecific males, the conspecific male always located and inseminated the female. These results indicate that significant prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation exists between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.

**Asymmetric Phenotypes of Sterile Hybrid Males From Reciprocal Crosses Between Species of the Anopheles gambiae Complex**

Liang, JT; Hodge, JM; Sharakhov, IV. 2021

Haldane's rule of speciation states that sterility or inviability affects the heterogametic sex of inter-species **hybrid**s. Darwin's corollary to Haldane's rule implies that there are asymmetric phenotypes in inter-species **hybrid**s from reciprocal crosses. Studying the phenotypes of F1 **hybrid**s among closely related species of malaria mosquitoes can assist researchers in identifying the genetic factors and molecular mechanisms of speciation. To characterize phenotypes of sterile **hybrid** males in the Anopheles gambiae complex, we performed crosses between laboratory strains of An. merus and either An. gambiae or An. coluzzii. The reproductive tracts had normal external morphology in **hybrid** males from crosses between female An. merus and male An. gambiae or An. coluzzii. Despite being sterile, these males could copulate with females for a normal period of time and could transfer a mating plug to induce female oviposition and monogamy. In contrast, the entire reproductive tracts in **hybrid** males from crosses between female An. gambiae or An. coluzzii and male An. merus were severely underdeveloped. These males had atrophic testes and reduced somatic organs of the reproductive system including male accessary glands and ejaculatory duct. In addition, **hybrid** males with underdeveloped reproductive tracts displayed a shorter copulation time with females and failed to induce female oviposition and monogamy due to their inability to form and transfer a plug to females during mating. The asymmetry of the phenotypes associated with **hybrid** male sterility suggests that different genetic factors and molecular mechanisms are responsible for reproductive isolation in reciprocal crosses among species of the An. gambiae complex.

**Insect Speciation Rules: Unifying Concepts in Speciation Research**

Mullen, SP; Shaw, KL. 2014

The study of speciation is concerned with understanding the connection between causes of divergent evolution and the origin and maintenance of barriers to gene exchange between incipient species. Although the field has historically focused either on examples of recent divergence and its causes or on the genetic basis of reproductive isolation between already divergent species, current efforts seek to unify these two approaches. Here we integrate these perspectives through a discussion of recent progress in several insect speciation model systems. We focus on the evolution of speciation phenotypes in each system (i.e., those phenotypes causally involved in reducing gene flow between incipient species), drawing an explicit connection between cause and effect (process and pattern). We emphasize emerging insights into the genomic architecture of speciation as well as timely areas for future research.

**Molecular identification of sympatric chromosomal forms of Anopheles gambiae and further evidence of their reproductive isolation**

Favia, G; dellaTorre, A; Bagayoko, M; Lanfrancotti, A; Sagnon, N; Toure, YT; Coluzzi, M. 1997

Three chromosomal forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s., designated as Bamako, Mopti and Savanna, were studied for diagnostic PCR assays based on the analysis of the X-linked ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The study was performed on a 1.3 kb fragment containing part of the 28S coding region and part of the intergenic spacer region, The amplified material was cut with fourteen restriction enzymes to detect Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs). The enzymes Tru9I and HhaI produced patterns of DNA bands which differentiated Mopti from Savanna and Bamako; moreover, a distinct '**hybrid**' pattern was recognized in the Fi female progeny from the cross of Mopti with either one of the other two chromosomal forms, The diagnostic significance of the PCR-RFLP assay was verified on 203 karyotyped females from field samples collected in two villages in Mall and one village in Burkina Faso. Agreement was observed between the chromosomal and the molecular identifications. No '**hybrid**' molecular patterns were detected even among carriers of rare heterokaryotypes hypothetically produced by crosses between Mopti and Savanna, The results confirm previous observations indicating barriers to gene flow within An. gambiae s.s. and supporting the specific status of the taxonomic units proposed on cytogenetic ground.

**Differences in gene regulation in a tephritid model of prezygotic reproductive isolation**

Raphael, KA; Sved, JA; Pearce, S; Oakeshott, JG; Gilchrist, AS; Sherwin, WB; Frommer, M. 2019

The two tephritid fruit fly pests, Bactrocera tryoni and Bactrocera neohumeralis, are unusually well suited to the study of the genetics of reproductive isolating mechanisms. Sequence difference between the species is no greater than between a pair of conspecific Drosophila melanogaster populations. The two species exist in close sympatry, yet do not **hybrid**ize in the field, apparently kept separate by a strong premating isolation mechanism involving the time of day at which mating occurs. This spurred us to search for key genes for which time of day expression is regulated differently between the species. Using replicated, quantitative transcriptomes from head tissues of males of the two species, sampled in the day and night, we identified 141 transcripts whose abundance showed a significant interaction between species and time of day, indicating a difference in gene regulation. The brain transcripts showing this interaction were enriched for genes with a neurone function and 90% of these were more abundant at night than day in B. tryoni. Features of the expression patterns suggest that there may be a difference in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles between the species. In particular several genes, which in D. melanogaster are expressed in circadian pacemaker cells, are promising candidates to further explore the genetic differentiation involved in this prezygotic reproductive isolation mechanism.

**Reproductive Isolation and Ecological Niche Partition among Larvae of the Morphologically Cryptic Sister Species Chironomus riparius and C. piger**

Pfenninger, M; Nowak, C. 2008

Background: One of the central issues in ecology is the question what allows sympatric occurrence of closely related species in the same general area? The non-biting midges Chironomus riparius and C. piger, interbreeding in the laboratory, have been shown to coexist frequently despite of their close relatedness, similar ecology and high morphological similarity. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to investigate factors shaping niche partitioning of these cryptic sister species, we explored the actual degree of reproductive isolation in the field. Congruent results from nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial haplotype analyses indicated complete absence of interspecific gene-flow. Autocorrelation analysis showed a non-random spatial distribution of the two species. Though not dispersal limited at the scale of the study area, the sister species occurred less often than expected at the same site, indicating past or present competition. Correlation and multiple regression analyses suggested the repartition of the available habitat along water chemistry gradients (nitrite, conductivity, CaCO3), ultimately governed by differences in summer precipitation regime. Conclusions: We show that these morphologically cryptic sister species partition their niches due to a certain degree of ecological distinctness and total reproductive isolation in the field. The coexistence of these species provides a suitable model system for the investigation of factors shaping the distribution of closely related, cryptic species.

**Behavioural isolation may facilitate homoploid hybrid speciation in cichlid fish**

Selz, OM; Thommen, R; Maan, ME; Seehausen, O. 2014

**Hybrid** speciation is constrained by the homogenizing effects of gene flow from the parental species. In the absence of post-mating isolation due to structural changes in the genome, or temporal or spatial premating isolation, another form of reproductive isolation would be needed for homoploid **hybrid** speciation to occur. Here, we investigate the potential of behavioural mate choice to generate assortative mating among **hybrid**s and parental species. We made three-first-generation **hybrid** crosses between different species of African cichlid fish. In three-way mate-choice experiments, we allowed **hybrid** and non**hybrid** females to mate with either **hybrid** or non**hybrid** males. We found that **hybrid**s generally mated nonrandomly and that **hybrid**ization can lead to the expression of new combinations of traits and preferences that behaviourally isolate **hybrid**s from both parental species. Specifically, we find that the phenotypic distinctiveness of **hybrid**s predicts the symmetry and extent of their reproductive isolation. Our data suggest that behavioural mate choice among **hybrid**s may facilitate the establishment of isolated **hybrid** populations, even in proximity to one or both parental species.

**The Diachasmimorpha longicaudata complex: Reproductive isolation and geometric patterns of the wing**

Kitthawee, S; Dujardin, JP. 2009

Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is an endoparasitoid of Tephritid fruit fly larvae and is regarded as an important biocontrol agent. However, it is likely that under this specific name several biological species may be contained, the correct identification of which is essential for effective use in control programs. In this paper, three populations (DLA, DLB and DLBB) of D. longicaudata designated according to geography and/or natural hosts were reared in the same laboratory. They were tested for reproductive compatibility and characterized by morphometric analyzes. Forced-contact mating technique showed either complete lack of inter-population reproductive compatibility or the production of rare, sterile female offspring. The three populations, indistinguishable on the basis of morphological characters alone, were readily identified by the geometry of the wing. Results strongly suggest that the DLA, DLB and DLBB are distinct biological species, and highlight the usefulness of wing geometry to distinguish them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

**Spatial swarm segregation and reproductive isolation between the molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae**

Diabate, A; Dao, A; Yaro, AS; Adamou, A; Gonzalez, R; Manoukis, NC; Traore, SF; Gwadz, RW; Lehmann, T. 2009

Anopheles gambiae, the major malaria vector in Africa, can be divided into two subgroups based on genetic and ecological criteria. These two subgroups, termed the M and S molecular forms, are believed to be incipient species. Although they display differences in the ecological niches they occupy in the field, they are often sympatric and readily **hybrid**ize in the laboratory to produce viable and fertile offspring. Evidence for assortative mating in the field was recently reported, but the underlying mechanisms awaited discovery. We studied swarming behaviour of the molecular forms and investigated the role of swarm segregation in mediating assortative mating. Molecular identification of 1145 males collected from 68 swarms in Doneguebougou, Mali, over 2 years revealed a strict pattern of spatial segregation, resulting in almost exclusively monotypic swarms with respect to molecular form. We found evidence of clustering of swarms composed of individuals of a single molecular form within the village. Tethered M and S females were introduced into natural swarms of the M form to verify the existence of possible mate recognition operating within-swarm. Both M and S females were inseminated regardless of their form under these conditions, suggesting no within-mate recognition. We argue that our results provide evidence that swarm spatial segregation strongly contributes to reproductive isolation between the molecular forms in Mali. However this does not exclude the possibility of additional mate recognition operating across the range distribution of the forms. We discuss the importance of spatial segregation in the context of possible geographic variation in mechanisms of reproductive isolation.

**"Singing on the Wing" as a Mechanism for Species Recognition in the Malarial Mosquito Anopheles gambiae**

Pennetier, C; Warren, B; Dabire, KR; Russell, IJ; Gibson, G. 2010

Anopheles gambiae, responsible for the majority of malaria deaths annually, is a complex of seven species and several chromosomal/molecular forms. The complexity of malaria epidemiology and control is due in part to An. gambiae's remarkable genetic plasticity, enabling its adaptation to a range of human-influenced habitats. This leads to rapid ecological speciation when reproductive isolation mechanisms develop [1-6]. Although reproductive isolation is essential for speciation, little is known about how it occurs in sympatric populations of incipient species [2]. We show that in such a population of "M" and "S" molecular forms, a novel mechanism of sexual recognition (male-female flight-tone matching [7-9]) also confers the capability of mate recognition, an essential precursor to assortative mating; frequency matching occurs more consistently in same-form pairs than in mixed-form pairs (p > 0.001). Furthermore, the key to frequency matching is "difference tones" produced in the nonlinear vibrations of the antenna by the combined flight tones of a pair of mosquitoes and detected by the Johnston's organ. By altering their wing-beat frequencies to minimize these difference tones, mosquitoes can match flight-tone harmonic frequencies above their auditory range. This is the first description of close-range mating interactions in incipient An. gambiae species.

**Male mating preference of two cryptic species of the herbivorous insect Eccritotarsus catarinensis**

Ismail, M; Brooks, M. 2018

When using biological control against pest populations, more than one biocontrol agent might be introduced simultaneously. This could be counterproductive in the event of negative interactions between the biocontrol agents. Within and between species interactions have a strong impact on mating behaviour and reproduction, and can have an impact on the effectiveness of biological control. We studied the reproductive compatibility between two geographically isolated strains (Brazil and Peru) of Eccritotarsus catarinensis (Heteroptera: Miridae), a biocontrol agent against the invasive aquatic weed, Eichhornia crassipes. By performing inter- and intra-species mating experiments, we investigated whether or not males from each of the cryptic species would be able to distinguish between partners from either species, and if they would mate with partners from the opposite species. Our results showed the decrease in lifetime fecundity, and most importantly, the lack of production of offspring from eggs resulting from forced **hybrid**isation. We showed that Peruvian males mated only with females from their own species, and did not mate with females from the Brazilian species. In contrast, Brazilian males mated equally with females from both species, but needed significantly more time in order to commence a mating, and no offspring were produced from eggs resulting from **hybrid**isation. Although future studies demand more rigorous controls, our results indicate asymmetrical sexual isolation between the two species. We speculate on mechanisms involved in reproductive isolation in the two cryptic species, and the possible implications for effective biocontrol, and include some morphological measurements that might support our assumptions.

**Reproductive isolation between Anopheles sinensis and Anopheles pullus in Korea**

Kim, SJ; Choochote, W; Jitpakdi, A; Junkum, A; Ahn, DA; Baek, JA; Park, MH; Kim, MS; Chung, KW; Min, GS. 2005

Anopheles sinensis and An. pullus, the 2 predominant anopheline mosquito species in Korea, are major malaria vectors. Their morphological similarity makes them difficult to distinguish, and their taxonomic relationship remains unclear. Kanda and Oguma produced fertile F, An. sinensis X An. pullus **hybrid**s, suggesting a conspecific relationship. However, our recent internal transcribed spacer 2 DNA sequence comparison of these taxa revealed 32.9% divergence, suggesting that An. sinensis and An. pullus may be distinct species. In the present study, we reassessed the relationship of An. sinensis and An. pullus in **hybrid**ization experiments. Laboratory-raised isofemale lines of An. sinensis form Band An. pullus form A and B were reciprocally crossed. The 3 isofemale lines were established from fully engorged females caught from the wild and morphologically identified as An. sinensis or An. pullus. The isofemale lines represented 3 distinct metaphase karyotypes: An. sinensis form B (X, Y-2) and An. pullus form A (X-1, Y-1) and form B (X-2, Y-2). The F-1 **hybrid** larvae showed low viability and completely asynaptic salivary gland polytene chromosomes. The subset of F, **hybrid**s that developed to adults showed sex-ratio distortion; ovarian follicles developed abnormally in females, and males suffered atrophy of accessory glands and testes. These results strongly suggest that the Korean morphological species An. sinensis and An. pullus are biological species, separated by complete postzygotic reproductive isolation.

**Reproductive interference betweenAedes albopictusandAedes flavopictusat a place of their origin**

Sultana, A; Sunahara, T; Tsurukawa, C; Tuno, N. 2021

Aedes(Stegomyia)albopictusandAedes(Stegomyia)flavopictusare related species that have overlapping distributions from southern to central Japan. To understand how they interact, we studied reproductive interference between them, particularly focusing on the body size difference between the mating pair. Here, we examined the effects of conspecific, heterospecific and double mating (i.e. heterospecific mating followed by conspecific mating) on copulation duration, egg production and hatchability of eggs using mosquitoes that varied in body size. Females mated only with heterospecific males produced few viable eggs, indicating that post-mating isolation is almost complete. When mated with heterospecific males before conspecific mating, the production of viable eggs was lower than when mated only with conspecific males, revealing the occurrence of reproductive interference. The degree of reproductive interference was larger inAe. flavopictusthan inAe. albopictuswhen the female size was small but did not differ between them when the female size was large.Aedes albopictusfemales appear to be able to distinguishAe. flavopictusmales from conspecific males and larger females are more successful in the rejection of heterospecific males. On the other hand,Ae. flavopictuswere not able to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific males.

**Theoretical models of the influence of genomic architecture on the dynamics of speciation**

Flaxman, SM; Wacholder, AC; Feder, JL; Nosil, P. 2014

A long-standing problem in evolutionary biology has been determining whether and how gradual, incremental changes at the gene level can account for rapid speciation and bursts of adaptive radiation. Using genome-scale computer simulations, we extend previous theory showing how gradual adaptive change can generate nonlinear population transitions, resulting in the rapid formation of new, reproductively isolated species. We show that these transitions occur via a mechanism rooted in a basic property of biological heredity: the organization of genes in genomes. Genomic organization of genes facilitates two processes: (i) the build-up of statistical associations among large numbers of genes and (ii) the action of divergent selection on persistent combinations of alleles. When a population has accumulated a critical amount of standing, divergently selected variation, the combination of these two processes allows many mutations of small effect to act synergistically and precipitously split one population into two discontinuous, reproductively isolated groups. Periods of allopatry, chromosomal linkage among loci, and large-effect alleles can facilitate this process under some conditions, but are not required for it. Our results complement and extend existing theory on alternative stable states during population divergence, distinct phases of speciation and the rapid emergence of multilocus barriers to gene flow. The results are thus a step towards aligning population genomic theory with modern empirical studies.

**Culex pipiens in London Underground tunnels: differentiation between surface and subterranean populations**

Byrne, K; Nichols, RA. 1999

Genetic variation was quantified between surface-dwelling populations of Culex pipiens and the so-called molestus form found in the London Underground (the Underground) railway system. The molestus form is a commercially important biting nuisance and in the southern part of its range is also a disease vector. The surface and subterranean populations were genetically distinct, with no evidence of gene flow between closely adjacent populations of the different forms, whereas there was little differentiation between the different populations of each form. The substantially reduced heterozygosity in the Underground populations and the allelic composition suggest that colonization of the Underground has occurred once or very few times. Breeding experiments show compatibility between the Underground populations but not with those breeding above ground. There is evidence of greater gene flow and a mixing of molestus and pipiens traits in the south of the species range. This paper considers the processes that may allow establishment of reproductive isolation in the north of the species range but not in the south.

**The role of aedeagus size and shape in failed mating interactions among recently diverged taxa in the Drosophila mojavensis species cluster**

Richmond, MP. 2014

Background: Investigating the evolution of species-specific insect genitalia is central to understanding how morphological diversification contributes to reproductive isolation and lineage divergence. While many studies evoke some form of sexual selection to explain genitalia diversity, the basis of selection and the mechanism of heterospecific mate exclusion remains vague. I conducted reciprocal mate pair trials in the Drosophila mojavensis species cluster to quantify the frequency of failed insemination attempts, historically referred to as pseudocopulation, between lineages with discrete size and shape differences of the male aedeagus. Results: In cross-taxon matings aedeagus size had a significant effect on pseudocopulation frequencies, while aedeagus shape and genetic distance did not. The direction of the size difference was an important factor for successful mating. When females were mated to a cross-taxon male with a larger aedeagus than males from her own species, the pair could not establish a successful mating interaction. Females mated to cross-taxon males with a smaller aedeagus than conspecific males were able to establish the mating interaction but had issues disengaging at the end of the interaction. Conclusions: The results of this study support a role for aedeagus size in the male-female mating interaction, with a secondary role for aedeagus shape. In natural populations, mating failure based on aedeagus size could serve as an important reproductive isolating mechanism resulting in failed insemination attempts after both the male and female show a willingness to mate.

**Divergence in larval diapause induction between the rice and water-oat populations of the striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)**

Zhou, Y; Sun, D; Quan, WL; Ding, N; Liu, W; Ma, WH; Wang, XP. 2018

Differences in diapause traits can result in the seasonal reproductive isolation of host plant-associated insect populations and thereby facilitate the population divergence. The striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, has two host plant-associated populations: rice population and water-oat population. Several studies have found evidence that seasonal reproductive isolation between these populations is at least partially due to interpopulation differences in diapause. However, there still lack unambiguous evidence comparing characteristics of diapause induction for both populations. We compared the photoperiodic response and the age of peak photoperiod sensitivity of these populations and used RNA-Seq to compare the molecular response of diapause induction between populations. The photoperiodic response of the two populations differed at 25 degrees C; the critical night length of larvae from the rice population was 11 h and 20 min, whereas no obvious critical night length was in those from the water-oat population. In rice population, larvae were most sensitive to photoperiod at 9-12 days of age, whereas in water-oat population, larvae were the most sensitive to photoperiod at 9-10 days of age. The RNA-Seq results indicated that there were several differences in the molecular response of diapause induction and small overlap in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between populations. Furthermore, GO analysis indicated that both rice and water-oat population's DEGs were significantly enriched in heme and iron binding. Besides, water-oat population's DEGs were significantly enriched in metabolizing nutrients but rice population's DEGs do not. Thus, our results described differences in diapause induction between rice and water-oat populations of C. suppressalis which could affect the timing of diapause and thereby contribute to the seasonal reproductive isolation of these host plant-associated populations. In conclusion, this work suggests that difference in diapause induction could promote the population divergence in insects associated with different host plants.

**Infectious Speciation Revisited: Impact of Symbiont-Depletion on Female Fitness and Mating Behavior of Drosophila paulistorum**

Miller, WJ; Ehrman, L; Schneider, D. 2010

The neotropical Drosophila paulistorum superspecies, consisting of at least six geographically overlapping but reproductively isolated semispecies, has been the object of extensive research since at least 1955, when it was initially trapped mid-evolution in flagrant statu nascendi. In this classic system females express strong premating isolation patterns against mates belonging to any other semispecies, and yet uncharacterized microbial reproductive tract symbionts were described triggering **hybrid** inviability and male sterility. Based on theoretical models and limited experimental data, prime candidates fostering symbiont-driven speciation in arthropods are intracellular bacteria belonging to the genus Wolbachia. They are maternally inherited symbionts of many arthropods capable of manipulating host reproductive biology for their own benefits. However, it is an ongoing debate as to whether or not reproductive symbionts are capable of driving host speciation in nature and if so, to what extent. Here we have reevaluated this classic case of infectious speciation by means of present day molecular approaches and artificial symbiont depletion experiments. We have isolated the alpha-proteobacteria Wolbachia as the maternally transmitted core endosymbionts of all D. paulistorum semispecies that have coevolved towards obligate mutualism with their respective native hosts. In **hybrid**s, however, these mutualists transform into pathogens by overreplication causing embryonic inviability and male sterility. We show that experimental reduction in native Wolbachia titer causes alterations in sex ratio, fecundity, and mate discrimination. Our results indicate that formerly designated Mycoplasma-like organisms are most likely Wolbachia that have evolved by becoming essential mutualistic symbionts in their respective natural hosts; they have the potential to trigger pre- and postmating isolation. Furthermore, in light of our new findings, we revisit the concept of infectious speciation and discuss potential mechanisms that can restrict or promote symbiont-induced speciation at post-and prezygotic levels in nature and under artificial laboratory conditions.

**Cryptic speciation and host-race formation in a purportedly generalist tumbling flower beetle**

Blair, CP; Abrahamson, WG; Jackman, JA; Tyrrell, L. 2005

Host-race formation remains controversial as a source of herbivorous insect diversity, and examples of host races are still fairly scarce. In this study, analysis of five enzyme loci in the ostensibly generalist tumbling flower beetle Mordellistena convicta (Coleoptera: Mordellidae) revealed hidden host-plant and plant-organ related genetic differentiation. Mordellistena convicta turned out to be a complex of cryptomorphic species, each with fewer hosts than the nominal species. These cryptic species, in turn, were divided into taxa that showed host-race characteristics: samples from different host plants and organs exhibited (1) genetic indications of partial reproductive isolation, (2) differences in size and emergence timing that suggested divergent host-related selection, and (3) among-host selective differences in mortality from parasitoids. Host-race formation in M. convicta, which has a somewhat different life history from the well-studied host races, enlarges the group of insects considered likely to undergo this process. The widespread sympatry of the M. convicta species complex, along with its spectrum of host-correlated genetic differentiation, suggests that these host specialist taxa developed in sympatry.

**Evaluating mating compatibility within fruit fly cryptic species complexes and the potential role of sex pheromones in pre-mating isolation**

Juarez, ML; Devescovi, F; Brizova, R; Bachmann, G; Segura, DF; Kalinova, B; Fernandez, P; Ruiz, MJ; Yang, JQ; Teal, PEA; Caceres, C; Vreysen, MJB; Hendrichs, J; Vera, MT. 2015

The study of sexual behavior and the identification of the signals involved in mate recognition between con-specifics are key components that can shed some light, as part of an integrative taxonomic approach, in delimitating species within species complexes. In the Tephritidae family several species complexes have received particular attention as they include important agricultural pests such as the Ceratitis fasciventris (Bezzi), Ceratitis anonae (Graham) and Ceratitis rosa Karsch (FAR) complex, the Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) complex and the Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) complex. Here the value and usefulness of a methodology that uses walk-in field cages with host trees to assess, under semi-natural conditions, mating compatibility within these complexes is reviewed, and the same methodology to study the role of chemical communication in pre-mating isolation among A. fraterculus populations is used. Results showed that under the same experimental conditions it was possible to distinguish an entire range of different outcomes: from full mating compatibility among some populations to complete assortative mating among others. The effectiveness of the methodology in contributing to defining species limits was shown in two species complexes: A. fraterculus and B. dorsalis, and in the case of the latter the synonymization of several established species was published. We conclude that walk-in field cages constitute a powerful tool to measure mating compatibility, which is also useful to determine the role of chemical signals in species recognition. Overall, this experimental approach provides a good source of information about reproductive boundaries to delimit species. However, it needs to be applied as part of an integrative taxonomic approach that simultaneously assesses cytogenetic, molecular, physiological and morphological traits in order to reach more robust species delimitations.

**Exon-Enriched Libraries Reveal Large Genic Differences Between Aedes aegypti from Senegal, West Africa, and Populations Outside Africa**

Dickson, LB; Campbell, CL; Juneja, P; Jiggins, FM; Sylla, M; Black, WC. 2017

Aedes aegypti is one of the most studied mosquito species, and the principal vector of several arboviruses pathogenic to humans. Recently failure to oviposit, low fecundity, and poor egg-to-adult survival were observed when Ae. aegypti from Senegal (SenAae) West Africa were crossed with Ae. aegypti (Aaa) from outside of Africa, and in SenAae intercrosses. Fluorescent in situ **hybrid**ization analyses indicated rearrangements on chromosome 1, and pericentric inversions on chromosomes 2 and 3. Herein, high throughput sequencing (HTS) of exon-enriched libraries was used to compare chromosome-wide genetic diversity among Aaa collections from rural Thailand and Mexico, a sylvatic collection from southeastern Senegal (PK10), and an urban collection from western Senegal (Kaolack). Sex-specific polymorphisms were analyzed in Thailand and PK10 to assess genetic differences between sexes. Expected heterozygosity was greatest in SenAae. F-ST distributions of 15,735 genes among all six pairwise comparisons of the four collections indicated that Mexican and Thailand collections are genetically similar, while F-ST distributions between PK10 and Kaolack were distinct. All four comparisons of SenAae with Aaa indicated extreme differentiation. F-ST was uniform between sexes across all chromosomes in Thailand, but were different, especially on the sex autosome 1, in PK10. These patterns correlate with the reproductive isolation noted earlier. We hypothesize that cryptic Ae. aegypti taxa may exist in West Africa, and the large genic differences between Aaa and SenAae detected in the present study have accumulated over a long period following the evolution of chromosome rearrangements in allopatric populations that subsequently cause reproductive isolation when these populations became sympatric.

**Exploring Heterogeneity in the Tachinid Uzifly, Exorista sorbillans**

Prakash, BM; Murthy, BCK; Puttaraju, HP. 2009

The uzifly, Exorista sorbillans (=E. bombycis) a tachinid endoparasitoid of silkworm, Bombyx mori L., known to cause considerable damage to the silk industry. Earlier studies on various aspects of the uzifly indicated for possible presence of a number of cryptic species. Though the fly entered into South India 25 years ago, the basis for the existence of cryptic species was not known. To ascertain whether the genome of this parasitoid is differentiating into discrete gene pools in contrasting eco and geo-climatic conditions, tin attempt has been made in the present study the molecular profiling of 8 populations (Chitoor, Kuppam, Erode, Bangarapete, Sira, Mandya, Chitradurga, and Kanakapura) from south India with 16 RAPD primers and also to explore the possibility of its endosymbiont Wolbachia as a causative agent as it known to cause cytoplasmic incompatibility in its host uzifly. The hierarchical clustering done on the basis of RAPD data and the Euclidean distance matrix put Chitradurga populations at the maximum distance from other south Indian populations studied and reveals the occurrence of spectacular region-wise pairing with separate clusters. Further, when we have crossed within and between selected populations for the Wolbachia induced reproductive isolation, the results showed the lower level (28-32%),of reproductive isolation within and between populations. The RAPD and crossing data clearly indicates the micro-level divergence in the uzifly, E. sorbillans. The significance of this study with a tachinid fly pest is discussed in the context of understanding the diversification of uzifly and also establishing this pest as a relevant biological material for studying microevolution in nature.

**Symbionts do not affect the mating incompatibility between the Brazilian-1 and Peruvian morphotypes of the Anastrepha fraterculus cryptic species complex**

Devescovi, F; Conte, CA; Augustinos, A; Martinez, EIC; Segura, DF; Caceres, C; Lanzavecchia, SB; Bourtzis, K. 2019

The South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus, is clearly undergoing a speciation process. Among others, two of their morphotypes, the Brazilian-1 and Peruvian, have accumulated differences in preand post-zygotic mechanisms resulting in a degree of reproductive isolation. Both harbor a different strain of Wolbachia, which is a widespread endosymbiotic bacterium among many invertebrates producing a range of reproductive effects. In this paper, we studied the role of this bacterium as one of the factors involved in such isolation process. Infected and cured laboratory colonies were used to test pre- and post-zygotic effects, with special emphasis in uni- and bi-directional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). We showed that Wolbachia is the only known reproductive symbiont present in these morphotypes. Wolbachia reduced the ability for embryonic development in crosses involving cured females and infected males within each morphotype (uni-directional CI). This inhibition showed to be more effective in the Peruvian morphotype. Bi-directional CI was not evidenced, suggesting the presence of compatible Wolbachia strains. We conclude that Wolbachia is not directly involved in the speciation process of these morphotypes. Other mechanisms rather than CI should be explored in order to explain the reduced mating compatibility between the Brazilian-1 and Peruvian morphotypes.

**Structure and Dynamics of Male Swarms of Anopheles gambiae**

Manoukis, NC; Diabate, A; Abdoulaye, A; Diallo, M; Dao, A; Yaro, AS; Ribeiro, JMC; Lehmann, T. 2009

Mosquito swarms are poorly Understood mating aggregations. In the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles, they are known to depend on environmental conditions, such as the presence of a marker on the ground, and they may be highly relevant to reproductive isolation. We present quantitative measurements of individual Art. gambiae positions within swarms from Doneguebougou, Mali, estimated by stereoscopic video image analysis. Results indicate that swarms in this species are approximately spherical, with all unexpectedly high density of individuals close to the swarm centroid. This high density may be the result of individual males maximizing their probability of encountering a female or a product of mosquito orientation through cues within the swarm. Our analysis also suggests a difference in swarm organization between putative incipient species of An. gambiae with increasing numbers of males. This may be related to a difference in marker use between these groups, supporting the hypothesis that swarming behavior is a mechanism of mate recognition and ultimately reproductive isolation,

**Genetic architecture underlying host choice differentiation in the sympatric host races of Lochmaea capreae leaf beetles**

Soudi, S; Reinhold, K; Engqvist, L. 2016

Speciation in herbivorous insects has received considerable attention during the last few decades. Much of this group's diversity originates from adaptive population divergence onto different host plants, which often involves the evolution of specialized patterns of host choice behaviour. Differences in host choice often translates directly into divergence in mating sites, and therefore positive assortative mating will be created which will act as a strong barrier to gene flow. In this study, we first explored whether host choice is a genetically determined trait in the sympatric willow and birch host races of the leaf feeding beetle Lochmaea capreae, or whether larval experience influences adult host choice. Once we had established that host choice is a genetically based trait we determined its genetic architecture. To achieve this, we employed a reciprocal transplant design in which offspring from pure willow and birch cross-types, F1, F2 and backcrosses were raised on each host plant and their preference was determined upon reaching adulthood. We then applied joint-scaling analysis to uncover the genetic architecture of host preference. Our results suggest that rearing host does not have a pronounced effect on adult's host choice; rather the segregation pattern implies the existence of genetic loci affecting host choice in these host races. The joint-scaling analysis revealed that population differences in host choice are mainly influenced by the contribution of additive genetic effects and also maternally inherited cytoplasmic effects. We explore the implications of our findings for evolutionary dynamics of sympatric host race formation and speciation.

**Comparison of sexual compatibility in crosses between the southern and northern populations of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi**

Liu, XP; Tu, XY; He, HM; Chen, C; Xue, FS. 2014

It is widely accepted that the genetic divergence and reproductive incompatibility between closely related species and/or populations is often viewed as an important step toward speciation. In this study, sexual compatibility in crosses between the southern XS population and the northern TA population of the polyandrous cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi was investigated by testing their mating preferences, mating latency, copulation duration, and reproductive performances of post-mating. In choice mating experiments, the percentages of matings were significantly higher in intra-population crosses than in inter-population crosses. Both isolation index (I) and index of pair sexual isolation (I-PSI) indicated partial mating incompatibility or assortative mating in crosses between the two different geographical populations. In single pair mating experiments, XS females in inter-population crosses mated significantly later and copulated significantly shorter than those in intra-population crosses. However, TA females in inter-population crosses mated significantly earlier and copulated longer than those in intra-population crosses, suggesting that larger XS males may enhance heterotypic mating. The lifetime fecundity was highest in XS homotypic matings, lowest in TA homotypic matings, and intermediate in heterotypic matings between their parents. The inter-population crosses resulted in significantly lower egg hatching rate and shorter female longevity than intra-population crosses. These results demonstrated that there exist some incompatibilities in premating, postmating-prezygotic, and postzygotic stages between the southern XS population and northern TA population of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi.

**Reproductive isolation between two populations of Diatraea saccharalis (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) from different host plant species and regions in Argentina**

Fogliata, SV; Vera, A; Gastaminza, G; Cuenya, MI; Zucchi, MI; Willink, E; Castagnaro, AP; Murua, MG. 2016

The sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), has a widespread distribution throughout the Western Hemisphere and is a pest of many crop plants including sugarcane, corn, sorghum and rice. The use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn has been the primary tool for managing this species in corn fields. Sugarcane borer control has been recently threatened by observations of susceptibility and/or resistance to certain varieties of Bt corn and the protein used in many newer varieties. This has led to increased interest in understanding sugarcane borer genetic diversity and gene flow within and among its populations and the consequent exchange of alleles between geographically distant populations. The objective of this study was to examine reproductive compatibility between host-associated geographic populations of D. saccharalis in Argentina and to determine whether this pest represents a complex of host-associated cryptic species rather than a wide ranging generalist species. Intra and inter-population crosses revealed that D. saccharalis populations from the northwestern and Pampas regions presented evidence of prezygotic and postzygotic incompatibility. Such a result is likely to be the product of an interruption of gene flow produced by either geographic or host plant associated isolation, suggesting that Tucuman (northwestern) and Buenos Aires (Pampas) populations of D. saccharalis are a distinct genotype and possibly an incipient species.

**Rapid and repeatable host plant shifts drive reproductive isolation following a recent human-mediated introduction of the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella**

Hood, GR; Powell, THQ; Doellman, MM; Sim, SB; Glover, M; Yee, WL; Goughnour, RB; Mattsson, M; Schwarz, D; Feder, JL. 2020

Ecological speciation via host-shifting is often invoked as a mechanism for insect diversification, but the relative importance of this process is poorly understood. The shift of Rhagoletis pomonella in the 1850s from the native downy hawthorn, Crataegus mollis, to introduced apple, Malus pumila, is a classic example of sympatric host race formation, a hypothesized early stage of ecological speciation. The accidental human-mediated introduction of R. pomonella into the Pacific Northwest (PNW) in the late 1970s allows us to investigate how novel ecological opportunities may trigger divergent adaptation and host race formation on a rapid timescale. Since the introduction, the fly has spread in the PNW, where in addition to apple, it now infests native black hawthorn, Crataegus douglasii, and introduced ornamental hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna. We use this "natural experiment" to test for genetic differentiation among apple, black, and ornamental hawthorn flies co-occurring at three sympatric sites. We report evidence that populations of all three host-associations are genetically differentiated at the local level, indicating that partial reproductive isolation has evolved in this novel habitat. Our results suggest that conditions suitable for initiating host-associated divergence may be common in nature, allowing for the rapid evolution of new host races when ecological opportunity arises.

**The molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae: A phenotypic perspective**

Lehmann, T; Diabate, A. 2008

The African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae is undergoing speciation, being split into the M and S molecular forms. Speciation is the main process promoting biological diversity, thus, new vector species might complicate disease transmission. Genetic differentiation between the molecular forms has been extensively studied, but phenotypic differences between them, the evolutionary forces that generated divergence, and the mechanisms that maintain their genetic isolation have only recently been addressed. Here, we review recent studies suggesting that selection mediated by larval predation and competition promoted divergence between temporary and permanent freshwater habitats. These differences explain the sharp discontinuity in distribution of the molecular forms between rice fields and surrounding savanna, but they can also explain the concurrent cline between humid and and environments due to the dependence on permanent habitats in the latter. Although less pronounced, differences in adult body size, reproductive output, and longevity also suggest that the molecular forms have adapted to distinct niches. Reproductive isolation between the molecular forms is achieved by spatial swarm segregation, although within-swarm mate recognition appears to play a role in certain locations. The implications of these results to disease transmission and control are discussed and many of the gaps in our understanding are highlighted. Published by Elsevier B.V.

**Reproductive Isolation between Host Races of Phytomyza glabricola on Ilex coriacea and I. glabra**

Hebert, JB; Scheffer, SJ; Hawthorne, DJ. 2013

Recently diverged taxa often show discordance in genetic divergence among genomic loci, where some loci show strong divergence and others show none at all. Genetic studies alone cannot distinguish among the possible mechanisms but experimental studies on other aspects of divergence may provide guidance in the inference of causes of observed discordances. In this study, we used no-choice mating trials to test for the presence of reproductive isolation between host races of the leaf-mining fly, Phytomyza glabricola on its two holly host species, Ilex coriacea and I. glabra. These trials inform our effort to determine the cause of significant differences in the degree of divergence of nuclear and mitochondrial loci of flies collected from the two host plants. We present evidence of reproductive isolation between host races in a controlled greenhouse setting: significantly more mate pairs consisting of flies from the same host plant species produced offspring than inter-host mate pairs, which produced no offspring. We also tested whether the presence of the natal or non-natal host plant affects reproductive success. Flies collected from I. coriacea were more likely to produce offspring when in the presence of the natal host, whereas the presence or absence of either the natal or non-natal host had no effect on flies collected from I. glabra. The results indicate discordant patterns of nuclear and mitochondrial divergence among host races of P. glabricola are likely due to incomplete lineage sorting, and the host races may be well on their way to becoming biological species.

**Premating isolation is determined by larval rearing substrates in cactophilic Drosophila mojavensis. VIII. Mating success mediated by epicuticular hydrocarbons within and between isolated populations**

Etges, WJ; Tripodi, AD. 2008

We tested the hypothesis that intrademic sexual selection has caused sexual isolation between populations of geographically isolated populations of cactophilic Drosophila mojavensis, and was mediated by epicuticular hydrocarbons (EHCs), contact pheromones in this system. Sexual selection and sexual isolation were estimated using a Baja California and mainland population by comparing the number of mated and unmated males and females in each of four pairwise population mating trials. EHC profiles were significantly different in mated and unmated males in the interdemic (Baja female x Mainland male and Mainland female x Baja male), but not the intrademic mating trials. A small number of EHCs was identified that best discriminated among mated and unmated males, mostly alkadienes with 34 and 37 carbons. Females showed population-specific preferences for male EHC profiles. However, EHC profiles between mated and unmated males in the intrademic mating trials were not significantly different, consistent with undetectable sexual selection estimated directly from numbers of copulating pairs vs. unmated adults. Thus, sexual isolation among populations was much stronger than sexual selection within these populations of D. mojavensis.

**Detection of serum neutralizing antibodies to Simbu sero-group viruses in cattle in Tanzania**

Mathew, C; Klevar, S; Elbers, ARW; van der Poel, WHM; Kirkland, PD; Godfroid, J; Mdegela, RH; Mwamengele, G; Stokstad, M. 2015

Background: Orthobunyaviruses belonging to the Simbu sero-group occur worldwide, including the newly recognized Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Europe. These viruses cause congenital malformations and reproductive losses in ruminants. Information on the presence of these viruses in Africa is scarce and the origin of SBV is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antibodies against SBV and closely related viruses in cattle in Tanzania, and their possible association with reproductive disorders. Results: In a cross-sectional study, serum from 659 cattle from 202 herds collected in 2012/2013 were analyzed using a commercial kit for SBV ELISA, and 61 % were positive. Univariable logistic regression revealed significant association between ELISA seropositivity and reproductive disorders (OR = 1.9). Sera from the same area collected in 2008/2009, before the SBV epidemic in Europe, were also tested and 71 (54.6 %) of 130 were positive. To interpret the ELISA results, SBV virus neutralization test (VNT) was performed on 110 sera collected in 2012/2013, of which 51 % were positive. Of 71 sera from 2008/2009, 21 % were positive. To investigate potential cross reactivity with related viruses, 45 sera from 2012/2013 that were positive in SBV ELISA were analyzed in VNTs for Aino, Akabane, Douglas, Peaton, Sabo, SBV, Sathuperi, Shamonda, Simbu and Tinaroo viruses. All 45 sera were positive for one or more of these viruses. Twenty-nine sera (64.4 %) were positive for SBV, and one had the highest titer for this virus. Conclusions: This is the first indication that Aino, Akabane, Douglas, Peaton, Sabo, SBV, Sathuperi, Shamonda and Tinaroo viruses circulate and cause negative effect on reproductive performance in cattle in Tanzania. SBV or a closely related virus was present before the European epidemic. However, potential cross reactivity complicates the interpretation of serological studies in areas where several related viruses may circulate. Virus isolation and molecular characterization in cattle and/or vectors is recommended to further identify the viruses circulating in this region. However, isolation in cattle is difficult due to short viremic period of 2 to 6 days, and isolation in vectors does not necessarily reflect the situation in cattle.

**EVIDENCE THROUGH CROSSMATING EXPERIMENTS OF A SPECIES COMPLEX IN ANOPHELES-PSEUDOPUNCTIPENNIS SENSU-LATO - A PRIMARY MALARIA VECTOR OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT**

ESTRADAFRANCO, JG; MA, MC; GWADZ, RW; SAKAI, R; LANZARO, GC; LAUGHINGHOUSE, A; GALVANSANCHEZ, C; CESPEDES, JL; VARGASSAGARNAGA, R. 1993

Crossmating experiments were conducted to determine if postmating reproductive barriers are involved in the maintenance of genetic divergence among populations of Anopheles pseudopunctipennis sensu lato, a primary malaria vector of the American continent. Reciprocal crosses were conducted between colony and wild strains from Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru. **Hybrid**ization experiments revealed unidirectional male/female **hybrid** sterility in crosses between Mexican females and South American males. The data presented provide the first evidence that genetic differences exist among geographic strains of An. pseudopunctipennis in neotropical America. There is a consistent pattern suggesting the presence of at least two allopatric sibling species. One species occurs in central Mexico, the other in the South American Andean Cordillera.

**Reproductive Incompatibility Involving Senegalese Aedes aegypti (L) Is Associated with Chromosome Rearrangements**

Dickson, LB; Sharakhova, MV; Timoshevskiy, VA; Fleming, KL; Caspary, A; Sylla, M; Black, WC. 2016

Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, yellow fever and Zika flaviviruses, consists of at least two subspecies. Aedes aegypti (Aaa) is light in color, has pale scales on the first abdominal tergite, oviposits in artificial containers, and preferentially feeds on humans. Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf), has a dark cuticle, is restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, has no pale scales on the first abdominal tergite and frequently oviposits in natural containers. Scale patterns correlate with cuticle color in East Africa but not in Senegal, West Africa where black cuticle mosquitoes display a continuum of scaling patterns and breed domestically indoors. An earlier laboratory study did not indicate any pre- or postzygotic barriers to gene flow between Aaa and Aaf in East Africa. However, similar attempts to construct F-1 intercross families between Aaa laboratory strains and Senegal Ae. aegypti (SenAae) failed due to poor F-1 oviposition and low F-2 egg-to-adult survival. Insemination and assortative mating experiments failed to identify prezygotic mating barriers. Backcrosses were performed to test for postzygotic isolation patterns consistent with Haldane's rule modified for species, like Aedes, that have an autosomal sex determining locus (SDL). Egg-pupal survival was predicted to be low in females mated to **hybrid** F-1 males but average when a male mates with a **hybrid** F-1 female. Survival was in fact significantly reduced when females mated to **hybrid** males but egg-pupal survival was significantly increased when males were mated to **hybrid** F-1 females. These observations are therefore inconclusive with regards to Haldane's rule. Basic cytogenetic analyses and Fluorescent In Situ **Hybrid**ization (FISH) experiments were performed to compare SenAae strains with the IB12 strain of Aaa that was used for genome sequencing and physical mapping. Some SenAae strains had longer chromosomes than IB12 and significantly different centromeric indices on chromosomes 1 and 3. DAPI staining was used to identify AT-rich regions, chromomycin A3 following pretreatment with barium hydroxide stained for GC-rich regions and stained the ribosomal RNA locus and YOYO-1 was used to test for differential staining. Chromosome patterns in SenAae strains revealed by these three stains differed from those in IB12. For FISH, 40 BAC clones previously physically mapped on Aaa chromosomes were used to test for chromosome rearrangements in SenAae relative to IB12. Differences in the order of markers identified two chromosomal rearrangements between IB12 and SenAae strains. The first rearrangement involves two overlapping pericentric (containing the centromere) inversions in chromosome 3 or an insertion of a large fragment into the 3q arm. The second rearrangement is close to the centromere on the p arm of chromosome 2. Linkage analysis of the SDL and the white-eye locus identified a likely chromosomal rearrangement on chromosome 1. The reproductive incompatibility observed within SenAae and between SenAae and Aaa may be generally associated with chromosome rearrangements on all three chromosomes and specifically caused by pericentric inversions on chromosomes 2 and 3.

**Drosophila yakuba mayottensis, a new model for the study of incipient ecological speciation**

Yassin, A. 2017

A full understanding of how ecological factors drive the fixation of genetic changes during speciation is obscured by the lack of appropriate models with clear natural history and powerful genetic toolkits. In a recent study, we described an early stage of ecological speciation in a population of the generalist species Drosophila yakuba (melanogaster subgroup) on the island of Mayotte (Indian Ocean). On this island, flies are strongly associated with the toxic fruits of noni (Morinda citrifolia) and show a partial degree of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation. Here, I mine the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and provide a full morphological description of this population. Only 29 nuclear sites (< 4 x 10(-7) of the genome) are fixed in this population and absent from 3 mainland populations and the closest relative D. santomea, but no mitochondrial or morphological character distinguish Mayotte flies from the mainland. This result indicates that physiological and behavioral traits may evolve faster than morphology at the early stages of speciation. Based on these differences, the Mayotte population is designated as a new subspecies, Drosophila yakuba mayottensis subsp. nov., and its strong potential in understanding the genetics of speciation and plant-insect interactions is discussed.

**IN VITRO HYBRIDIZATION OF HAEMOPROTEUS SPP.: AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH FOR DIRECT INVESTIGATION OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION OF PARASITES**

Valkiunas, G; Iezhova, TA; Krizanauskiene, A; Palinauskas, V; Bensch, S. 2008

In spite of their potential its model organisms and their medical importance. parasite speciation processes have been insufficiently discussed in the literature. Scarcity of experimental data regarding reproductive isolation of parasites is it serious obstacle. Toward this end we developed it method for the investigation of **hybrid**ization of hemosporidian parasites ill vitro. Five species of Haemoproteus (Haemosporida, Haemoproteidae) were isolated from naturally infected passerine birds. They were identified to species based on morphology of their gametocytes and PCR amplification of a segment of the parasite's mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. **Hybrid**ization of Haemoproteus spp. vas initiated ill vitro by mixing blood containing mature gametocytes of different species with a 3.7% solution of sodium citrate and exposure of the mixture to air. The following **hybrid**ization experiments were performed: (1) Haemoproteus minutus x Haemoproteus pallidus, (2) Haemoproteus balmorali fringillae x H. tartakovskyi. The development of ookinetes of both species x Hemoproteus tartakovskyi, and (3) Haemoproteus was blocked ill the first experiment. Ookinetes of all species developed ill other experiments, but presumed **hybrid**s were distinguished only ill the third experiment. Illustrations of ookinetes species are given. The present communication indicates that controlled experiments for direct **hybrid**ization of hemosporidians, can be carried out in vitro. Such experimental research can be used to reconcile molecular and morphological data and to define biological Species for this group of parasites.

**Interspecific hybridization between Liriomyza trifolii and Liriomyza sativae**

Sakamaki, Y; Miura, K; Chi, YC. 2005

Experimental interspecific **hybrid**ization between the notorious, worldwide horticultural crop pests briomyza trifolii (Burgess) and Liriomyza sativae Blanchard is reported. Premating reproductive isolation was easily disrupted under no-choice crossing conditions; **hybrid** flies were obtained only in one mating combination (female L. sativae X male L. trifolii). Crosses between them yielded only female progeny, which had some superficial characters identified as L. sativae, but the shape of the genitalia was similar to that of L. trifolii. All of the F1 **hybrid**s were sterile and could not be backcrossed to either parental species. An electrophoretic analysis of internal transcribed spacer region sequences on ribosomal DNA genes and a nucleotide sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I DNA sequences confirmed that the progeny were not the result of parthenogenetic reproduction.

**Harmonic convergence coordinates swarm mating by enhancing mate detection in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae**

Castillo, SSG; Pritts, KS; Krishnan, RS; Harrington, LC; League, GP. 2021

The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is a major African malaria vector, transmitting parasites responsible for significant mortality and disease burden. Although flight acoustics are essential to mosquito mating and present promising alternatives to insecticide-based vector control strategies, there is limited data on mosquito flight tones during swarming. Here, for the first time, we present detailed analyses of free-flying male and female An. gambiae flight tones and their harmonization (harmonic convergence) over a complete swarm sequence. Audio analysis of single-sex swarms showed synchronized elevation of male and female flight tones during swarming. Analysis of mixed-sex swarms revealed additional 50 Hz increases in male and female flight tones due to mating activity. Furthermore, harmonic differences between male and female swarm tones in mixed-sex swarms and in single-sex male swarms with artificial female swarm audio playback indicate that frequency differences of approximately 50 Hz or less at the male second and female third harmonics (M2:F3) are maintained both before and during mating interactions. This harmonization likely coordinates male scramble competition by maintaining ideal acoustic recognition within mating pairs while acoustically masking phonotactic responses of nearby swarming males to mating females. These findings advance our knowledge of mosquito swarm acoustics and provide vital information for reproductive control strategies.

**Reproductive interference and Satyrisation: mechanisms, outcomes and potential use for insect control**

Mitchell, C; Leigh, S; Alphey, L; Haerty, W; Chapman, T. NA

Reproductive Interference occurs when interactions between individuals from different species disrupt reproductive processes, resulting in a fitness cost to one or both parties involved. It is typically observed between individuals of closely related species, often upon secondary contact. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, Reproductive Interference is frequently referred to as 'Satyrisation'. It can manifest in various ways, ranging from blocking or reducing the efficacy of mating signals, through to negative effects of heterospecific copulations and the production of sterile or infertile **hybrid** offspring. The negative fitness effects of Satyrisation in reciprocal matings between species are often asymmetric and it is this aspect, which is most relevant to, and can offer utility in, pest management. In this review, we focus on Satyrisation and outline the mechanisms through which it can operate. We illustrate this by using test cases, and we consider the underlying reasons why the reproductive interactions that comprise Satyrisation occur. We synthesise the key factors affecting the expression of Satyrisation and explore how they have potential utility in developing new routes for the management and control of harmful insects. We consider how Satyrisation might interact with other control mechanisms, and conclude by outlining a framework for its use in control, highlighting some of the important next steps.

**Chemically mediated sexual signals restrict hybrid speciation in a flea beetle**

Xue, HJ; Segraves, KA; Wei, J; Zhang, B; Nie, RE; Li, WZ; Yang, XK. 2018

The evolution of reproductive isolation following **hybrid**ization is a major obstacle that may limit the prevalence of **hybrid** speciation among specific groups of organisms. Here, we use a flea beetle system to offer a behavioral hypothesis for why there are so few examples of homoploid **hybrid** speciation among insects. Specifically, we examined cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) mating signals and mate-choice decisions of Altica fragariae and A. viridicyanea to test whether the signals produced by **hybrid**s cause prezygotic reproductive isolation. Although **hybrid**s of A. fragariae and A. viridicyanea had unique CHC profiles as compared to the parental species, mate-choice trials indicated that these differences were insufficient to prevent gene flow between **hybrid**s and parental species. We found that mate-choice decisions and CHC signals were not correlated. Considering the ubiquity of CHC signaling molecules in insects, we propose that decoupling of CHC signals and mate choice may be a general mechanism limiting **hybrid** speciation in insects.

**Venereal Transmission of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus by Culicoides sonorensis Midges**

Rozo-Lopez, P; Londono-Renteria, B; Drolet, BS. NA

Culicoides sonorensis biting midges are well-known agricultural pests and transmission vectors of arboviruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The epidemiology of VSV is complex and encompasses a broad range of vertebrate hosts, multiple routes of transmission, and diverse vector species. In temperate regions, viruses can overwinter in the absence of infected animals through unknown mechanisms, to reoccur the next year. Non-conventional routes for VSV vector transmission may help explain viral maintenance in midge populations during inter-epidemic periods and times of adverse conditions for bite transmission. In this study, we examined whether VSV could be transmitted venereally between male and female midges. Our results showed that VSV-infected females could venereally transmit virus to uninfected naive males at a rate as high as 76.3% (RT-qPCR), 31.6% (virus isolation) during the third gonotrophic cycle. Additionally, VSV-infected males could venereally transmit virus to uninfected naive females at a rate as high as 76.6% (RT-qPCR), 49.2% (virus isolation). Immunofluorescent staining of micro-dissected reproductive organs, immunochemical staining of midge histological sections, examination of internal reproductive organ morphology, and observations of mating behaviors were used to determine relevant anatomical sites for virus location and to hypothesize the potential mechanism for VSV transmission in C. sonorensis midges through copulation.

**Aerobic bacterial microbiota in Stomoxys calcitrans: preliminary studies in Brazil**

De Castro, BG; De Souza, MMS; Bittencourt, AJ. 2007

The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans, has a great importance in medical and veterinary health due to its feeding and reproductive habits, which can disseminate some pathogenic agents among hosts even at long distances. This study aimed to describe, for the first time in Brazil, the bacterial microbiota in segments of the stable fly. Bacterial species were isolated from three different segments (cuticle, mouth parts and abdominal alimentary tract) of the stable fly. Twenty dairy farms were visited in four municipalities: Barra Mansa, Quatis, Resende and Rio Claro in the State of Rio de Janeiro in order to collect 20 flies in each site. Dissection of the flies and procedures of isolation and identification of bacterial species were performed. A total of 161 colonies of 33 distinct species were isolated, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. intennedius. Stomoxys calcitrans may harbor bacterial agents on their cuticle, mouth parts and abdominal alimentary tract and these bacteria may be pathogenic to their hosts.

**Evolution of resistance to satyrization through reproductive character displacement in populations of invasive dengue vectors**

Bargielowski, IE; Lounibos, LP; Carrasquilla, MC. 2013

Recently, the highly invasive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, rapidly displaced resident populations of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti in the southeastern United States and in Bermuda. Although multiple mechanisms of competitive displacement have been hypothesized, recent evidence of cross-insemination between these species in nature and the sterilizing effects of male accessory gland products asymmetrically favoring A. albopictus in interspecific matings support a role for satyrization (a form of reproductive interference) to explain the rapid displacements. Because of the drastic reproductive loss of A. aegypti females satyrized by A. albopictus males, we predicted selection for prezygotic isolation in populations of A. aegypti sympatric with A. albopictus. Exposures in cages demonstrated that female A. aegypti from populations in Florida sympatric with A. albopictus for the past 20 y were significantly less likely than nearby allopatric populations to mate with heterospecific males. Cross-inseminations of A. albopictus females by A. aegypti males were significantly less common, supporting the one-way direction of displacements observed in nature. Our results indicate rapid sexual selection leading to reproductive character displacement and the potential for satyr-resistant A. aegypti to recover from competitive displacements. These results have implications for increased risks of dengue transmission where these vector species meet worldwide.

**Ecological adaptation and reproductive isolation in sympatry: genetic and phenotypic evidence for native host races of Rhagoletis pomonella**

Powell, THQ; Forbes, AA; Hood, GR; Feder, JL. 2014

Ecological speciation with gene flow may be an important mode of diversification for phytophagous insects. The recent shift of Rhagoletis pomonella from its native host downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to introduced apple (Malus domestica) in the northeastern United States is a classic example of sympatric host race formation. Here, we test whether R.pomonella has similarly formed host races on four native Crataegus species in the southern United States: western mayhaw (C.opaca), blueberry hawthorn (C.brachyacantha), southern red hawthorn (C.mollis var. texana) and green hawthorn (C.viridis). These four southern hosts differ from each other in their fruiting phenology and in the volatile compounds emitted from the surface of their fruits. These two traits form the basis of ecological reproductive isolation between downy hawthorn and apple flies in the north. We report evidence from microsatellite population surveys and eclosion studies supporting the existence of genetically differentiated and partially reproductively isolated host races of southern hawthorn flies. The results provide an example of host shifting and ecological divergence involving native plants and imply that speciation with gene flow may be commonly initiated in Rhagoletis when ecological opportunity presents itself.

**Population genetics of Anopheles koliensis through Papua New Guinea: New cryptic species and landscape topography effects on genetic connectivity**

Ambrose, L; Hanson, JO; Riginos, C; Xu, WX; Fordyce, S; Cooper, RD; Beebe, NW. 2019

New Guinea is a topographically and biogeographically complex region that supports unique endemic fauna. Studies describing the population connectivity of species through this region are scarce. We present a population and landscape genetic study on the endemic malaria-transmitting mosquito, Anopheles koliensis (Owen). Using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data, as well as microsatellites, we show the evidence of geographically discrete population structure within Papua New Guinea (PNG). We also confirm the existence of three rDNA ITS2 genotypes within this mosquito and assess reproductive isolation between individuals carrying different genotypes. Microsatellites reveal the clearest population structure and show four clear population units. Microsatellite markers also reveal probable reproductive isolation between sympatric populations in northern PNG with different ITS2 genotypes, suggesting that these populations may represent distinct cryptic species. Excluding individuals belonging to the newly identified putative cryptic species (ITS2 genotype 3), we modeled the genetic differences between A. koliensis populations through PNG as a function of terrain and find that dispersal is most likely along routes with low topographic relief. Overall, these results show that A. koliensis is made up of geographically and genetically discrete populations in Papua New Guinea with landscape topography being important in restricting dispersal.

**Phenotypic differentiation in love song traits among sibling species of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex in Brazil**

Vigoder, FM; Souza, NA; Brazil, RP; Bruno, RV; Costa, PL; Ritchie, MG; Klaczko, LB; Peixoto, AA. 2015

Background: Brazilian populations of Lutzomyia longipalpis may constitute a complex of cryptic species, and this report investigates the distribution and number of potential sibling species. One of the main differences observed among Brazilian populations is the type of acoustic signal produced by males during copulation. These copulation song differences seem to be evolving faster than neutral molecular markers and have been suggested to contribute to insemination failure observed in crosses between these sibling species. In previous studies, two main types of copulation songs were found, burst-type and pulse-type. The latter type can, in turn, be further subdivided into five different patterns. Methods: We recorded male song from 13 new populations of the L. longipalpis complex from Brazil and compared the songs with 12 already available. Results: Out of these 25 populations, 16 produce burst-type and 9 produce pulse-type songs. We performed a principal component analysis in these two main groups separately and an additional discriminant analysis in the pulse-type group. The pulse-type populations showed a clear separation between the five known patterns with a high correspondence of individuals to their correct group, confirming the differentiation between them. The distinctiveness of the burst-type subgroups was much lower than that observed among the pulse-type groups and no clear population structure was observed. This suggests that the burst-type populations represent a single species. Conclusion: Overall, our results are consistent with the existence in Brazil of at least six species of the L. longipalpis complex, one with a wide distribution comprising all the populations with burst-type songs, and five more closely related allopatric siblings with different pulse-type song patterns and more restricted distribution ranges.

**Seroprevalence of bovine arboviruses belonging to genus Orthobunyavirus in South Korea**

Jun, K; Yanaka, T; Lee, KK; Lee, JB. 2018

Arboviruses, belonging to the Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus, often cause congenital malformations and reproductive loss in cattle. The recent occurrences of such reproductive problems suggest that new arboviruses have emerged in Japan. However, there is no information on the presence of these viruses in South Korea. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of antibodies for Akabane, Aino, Peaton, Sathuperi, and Shamonda viruses in four regions, namely Gyeonggi, Jeollabuk, Jeollanam provinces, and Jeju Island of South Korea by a serum neutralization test. Antibody positivity against Akabane, Aino, Peaton, Sathuperi, and Shamonda viruses was detected in the country, with average seropositive rates of 10.4, 4.5, 1.1, 4.9, and 5.6%, respectively.

**Isolation and identification of terpenoid sex pheromone components from extracts of hemolymph of males of the Caribbean fruit fly**

Teal, PEA; Meredith, JA; Gomez-Simuta, Y. 1999

Extracts obtained from hemolymph of sexually mature males of the Caribbean fruit fly Anastrepha suspensa contained four biologically important terpenoid components of the sex pheromone. The four components were identified as farnesene, bisabolene, anastrephin, and epianastrepin based on their relative retention indexes from capillary gas chromatography analysis, using both apolar and polar phase columns and their chemical ionization (isobutane) mass spectra. The ratio of the components in extracts of hemolymph was the same as the ratio present in the volatile blend of pheromone released by sexually mature males during the reproductive period. Studies conducted to determine the effect of age on amounts of these components in hemolymph indicated that they increased from undetectable levels on the day of adult emergence to maximum levels on day eight. The increases in amounts of the components present in hemolymph with increasing age were correlated with increases in amounts of volatile pheromone released by males. Time of day studies showed that the amounts of these components in hemolymph followed the daily pattern of release of volatile pheromone components. Other components of the sex pheromone including ocimene, (Z)-3-nonen-1-ol, (Z,Z)-3,6-nonadien-1-ol and suspensolide were not found in extracts of hemolymph. The data suggest that the hemolymph plays a role in the transport of these pheromone components during sexual signalling. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 42:225-232, 1999.

**Fruit odor discrimination and sympatric host race formation in Rhagoletis**

Linn, C; Feder, JL; Nojima, S; Dambroski, HR; Berlocher, SH; Roelofs, W. 2003

Rhagoletis pomonella is a model for incipient sympatric speciation (divergence without geographic isolation) by host-plant shifts. Here, we show that historically derived apple- and ancestral hawthorn-infesting host races of the fly use fruit odor as a key olfactory cue to help distinguish between their respective plants. in flight-tunnel assays and field tests, apple and hawthorn flies preferentially oriented to, and were captured with, chemical blends of their natal fruit volatiles. Because R. pomonella rendezvous on or near the unabscised fruit of their hosts to mate, the behavioral preference for apple vs. hawthorn fruit odor translates directly into premating reproductive isolation between the fly races. We have therefore identified a key and recently evolved (<150 years) mechanism responsible for host choice in R. pomonella bearing directly on sympatric host race formation and speciation.

**Replicated host-race formation in bogus yucca moths: genetic and ecological divergence of Prodoxus quinquepunctellus on yucca hosts**

Svensson, GP; Althoff, DM; Pellmyr, O. 2005

Goal: Assess host-race formation in certain moths by examining their genetic and ecological differentiation. Organisms: Stalk-feeding moths, Prodoxus quinquepunctellus, collected from sympatric populations of Yucca elata and Y rostrata in west Texas, USA. Results: Moths on the two yuccas differed significantly in mtDNA haplotype frequencies, emergence time, wing dot number, body size, and ovipositor size and shape. Conclusion: Host-race formation has probably occurred in this yucca moth although genetic divergence was low.

**Evolution of multiple kinds of female sperm-storage organs in Drosophila**

Pitnick, S; Markow, T; Spicer, GS. 1999

Females of all species belonging to the family Drosophilidae have two kinds of sperm-storage organs: paired spherical spermathecae and a single elongate tubular seminal receptacle. We examined 113 species belonging to the genus Drosophila and closely allied genera and describe variation in female sperm-storage organ use and morphology. The macroevolutionary pattern of organ dysfunction and morphological divergence suggests that ancestrally both kinds of organs stored sperm. Loss of use of the spermathecae has evolved at least 13 times; evolutionary regain of spermathecal function has rarely if ever occurred. Loss of use of the seminal receptacle has likely occurred only once; in this case, all descendant species possess unusually elaborate spermathecae. Data further indicate that the seminal receptacle is the primary sperm-storage organ in Drosophila. This organ exhibits a pattern of strong correlated evolution with the length of sperm. The evolution of multiple kinds of female sperm-storage organs and the rapidly divergent and correlated evolution of sperm and female reproductive tract morphology are discussed.

**Genetic analysis of Drosophila virilis sex pheromone: Genetic mapping of the locus producing Z-(11)-pentacosene**

Doi, M; Tomaru, M; Matsubayashi, H; Yamanoi, K; Oguma, Y. 1996

Z-(11)-pentacosene, Drosophila virilis sex pheromone, is predominant among the female cuticular hydrocarbons and can elicit male courtship behaviours. To evaluate the genetic basis of its production, interspecific crosses between D. novamexicana and genetically marked D. virilis were made and hydrocarbon profiles of their backcross progeny were analysed. The production of Z-(11)-pentacosene was autosomally controlled and was recessive. Of the six D. virilis chromosomes only the second and the third chromosomes showed significant contributions to sex pheromone production, and acted additively. Analysis of recombinant females indicated that the locus on the second chromosome mapped to the proximity of position 2-218.

**Cytotypes of the Simulium arcticum species complex in the American Pacific Northwest**

Shields, GF. NA

The larval polytene chromosomes of 17 of the 22 known cytotypes of the Simulium arcticum Malloch complex were analyzed and compared at 59 collection sites in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Cytotypes range from those that were broadly distributed, such as IIL-9, which was found at 25 different sites, to those that were found at only one or two sites, such as IIL-73-74. Cytotypes are "clustered" in a geographic sense, suggesting that once a new cytotype is described, if it is found again, it will be fbund nearby. The cytotype S. arcticum IIL-9 was found at 11 of the 25 sites where S. arcticum IIL-19 exists. Finally, based on its sibling species status and widespread distribution throughout the Pacific Northwest, Simulium brevicercum may be an early ancestor of the complex given that it occurs at 44 of the 59 sites sampled. The observations and conclusions of this research are scientifically important because previous research suggests that reproductive isolation may have begun among these cytotypes at these sites, and unless their locations are reported, they cannot be studied further. Future work should incorporate a multiornic approach to study the putative initial divergences within this complex.

**Evolution and diversity of inherited viruses in the Nearctic phantom midge, Chaoborus americanus**

Ballinger, MJ; Christian, RC; Moore, LD; Taylor, DJ; Sabet, A. 2022

Inherited mutualists, parasites, and commensals occupy one of the most intimate ecological niches available to invertebrate-associated microbes. How this transmission environment influences microbial evolution is increasingly understood for inherited bacterial symbionts, but in viruses, research on the prevalence of vertical transmission and its effects on viral lineages is still maturing. The evolutionary stability of this strategy remains difficult to assess, although phylogenetic evidence of frequent host shifts and selective sweeps have been interpreted as strategies favoring parasite persistence. In this study, we describe and investigate a natural insect system in which species-wide sweeps have been restricted by the isolation of host populations. Previous work identified evidence of pronounced mitochondrial genetic structure among North American populations of the phantom midge, Chaoborus americanus. Here we take advantage of the geographical isolation in this species to investigate the diversity and persistence of its inherited virome. We identify eight novel RNA viruses from six families and use small RNA sequencing in reproductive tissues to provide evidence of vertical transmission. We report region-specific virus strains that mirror the continental phylogeography of the host, demonstrating that members of the inherited virome have independently persisted in parallel host lineages since they last shared a common ancestor in the Mid-Pleistocene. We find that the small interfering RNA pathway, a frontline of antiviral defense in insects, targets members of this inherited virome. Finally, our results suggest that the Piwi-mediated RNA silencing pathway is unlikely to function as a general antiviral defense in Chaoborus, in contrast to its role in some mosquitoes. However, we also report that this pathway generates abundant piRNAs from endogenous viral elements closely related to actively infecting inherited viruses, potentially helping to explain idiosyncratic patterns of virus-specific Piwi targeting in this insect.

**Age-dependent insemination success of sterile Mediterranean fruit flies**

Taylor, PW; Kaspi, R; Mossinson, S; Yuval, B. 2001

The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is used in many regions worldwide to manage wild populations of the Mediterranean fruit fly ('medfly'). an important pest species. This technique relies on released sterile malts outcompeting their wild counterparts in fertilizing ova of wild females. Numerous studies have investigated the ability of sterile males to secure copulations, an essential step toward overall success. Here we progress further along the mating sequence by studying reproductive barriers that may remain ahead of sterile males that manage to secure copulations in field cage experiments and whether ability to pass these barriers is influenced by a males age, diet and size, or the size of his mate. Amongst those virgin males that succeeded in copulating, both the number of sperm stored by mates and the chances of having any sperm stored at all decreased with age. Sperm tended to be stored asymmetrically between the females two spermathecae, and this tendency was mon apparent when few sperm were stored. In accord with effects of male age on number of sperm stored, sperm of older males were stored more asymmetrically than that of young males. We found no evidence that male size, male diet or female size influenced copula duration, number of sperm stored or allocation of sperm between the female's two spermathecae. The decline in number of sperm stored as males aged was not accompanied by age-dependent changes in copula duration, indicating that copula duration and insemination success are not deterministically linked. We discuss these results in light of their relevance to SIT and the medfly mating system.

**Demonstrating sexual selection by cryptic female choice on male genitalia: What is enough?**

Eberhard, WG; Lehmann, GUC. 2019

Rapid divergence in external genital structures occurs in nearly all animal groups that practice internal insemination; explaining this pattern is a major challenge in evolutionary biology. The hypothesis that species-specific differences in male genitalia evolved under sexual selection as courtship devices to influence cryptic female choice (CFC) has been slow to be accepted. Doubts may stem from its radical departure from previous ideas, observational difficulties because crucial events occur hidden within the female's body, and alternative hypotheses involving biologically important phenomena such as speciation, sperm competition, and male-female conflicts of interest. We assess the current status of the CFC hypothesis by reviewing data from two groups in which crucial predictions have been especially well-tested, Glossina tsetse flies and Roeseliana (formerly Metrioptera) roeselii bushcrickets. Eighteen CFC predictions have been confirmed in Glossina and 19 in Roeseliana. We found data justifying rejection of alternative hypotheses, but none that contradicted CFC predictions. The number and extent of tests confirming predictions of the CFC hypothesis in these species is greater than that for other generally accepted hypotheses regarding the functions of nongenital structures. By this criterion, it is reasonable to conclude that some genital structures in both groups likely involved sexual selection by CFC.

**The yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus (Pichia anomala) inhabits the midgut and reproductive system of the Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi**

Ricci, I; Damiani, C; Scuppa, P; Mosca, M; Crotti, E; Rossi, P; Rizzi, A; Capone, A; Gonella, E; Ballarini, P; Chouaia, B; Sagnon, N; Esposito, F; Alma, A; Mandrioli, M; Sacchi, L; Bandi, C; Daffonchio, D; Favia, G. 2011

P>While symbiosis between bacteria and insects has been thoroughly investigated in the last two decades, investments on the study of yeasts associated with insects have been limited. Insect-associated yeasts are placed on different branches of the phylogenetic tree of fungi, indicating that these associations evolved independently on several occasions. Isolation of yeasts is frequently reported from insect habitats, and in some cases yeasts have been detected in the insect gut and in other organs/tissues. Here we show that the yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus, previously known as Pichia anomala, is stably associated with the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, a main vector of malaria in Asia. Wickerhamomyces anomalus colonized pre-adult stages (larvae L-1-L-4 and pupae) and adults of different sex and age and could be isolated in pure culture. By a combination of transmission electron microscopy and fluorescent in situ **hybrid**ization techniques, W. anomalus was shown to localize in the midgut and in both the male and female reproductive systems, suggesting multiple transmission patterns.

**Enhancing efficacy of Mexican fruit fly SIT programmes by large-scale incorporation of methoprene into pre-release diet**

Gomez, Y; Teal, PEA; Pereira, R. 2013

The juvenile hormone analogue, methoprene, has been documented to accelerate the development of reproductive competence and sexual signalling of Caribbean (Anastrepha suspensa), the Mexican (Anastrepha ludens), the South American (Anastrepha fraterculus) and West Indian (Anastrepha obliqua) tephritid fruit flies. The incorporation of methoprene into sterile fly release protocols at fly emergence and handling facilities is a key step required for large-scale application of the technology to field release strategies. The goal of our study was to develop a method to supply, in large scale, methoprene to sterile Mexican fruit flies for release in the current Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) programme in Mexico. In field cage tests, the isolation index of sterile males after treatment with methoprene was reduced, increasing the percentage of mating between laboratory sterile males and wild females. In laboratory trials, males fed a diet containing 0.05% or 0.1% methoprene mated 4-day earlier than untreated control males. In a pilot area tested in 3500ha to measure the impact of the sterile releases when methoprene was supplied, no adult wild flies were detected and no larvae were found after sampling more than 330kg of fruit both in the treated and untreated blocks. Based on the results obtained in this study, we recommend the incorporation of the methoprene on adult diet to improve the Mexican fruit fly male sexual performance when release in the field, contributing to the increase in the cost-effectiveness of the SIT programme.

**Dinner and a show: The role of male copulatory courtship song and female blood-feeding in the reproductive success of Lutzomyia longipalpis from Lapinha, Brazil**

Vigoder, FM; Araki, AS; Carvalho, AB; Brazil, RP; Ritchie, MG. 2020

Lutzomyia longipalpis is the main vector of visceral Leishmaniasis in the Americas and is composed of a species complex. Males of this sand-fly produce acoustic signals during copulation and different patterns are observed among Brazilian populations. Such acoustic signals are commonly involved in species recognition. However, since the song is only produced during copulation it is not clear how it affects mating success or contributes to sexual isolation. Another aspect that may affect reproductive success is the presence of food. Since hematophagy is such an important aspect of L. longipalpis biology, we wanted to test if blood-feeding can influence the reproductive behaviour of this insect. We performed crossing experiments removing males' wings (silencing them) and playing back either the homo-specific or the hetero-specific song to either unfed or blood-fed females. Our results showed that both songs and blood-feeding affect insemination success, but not the frequency of copulation. In trials where females were not blood-fed song clearly affected insemination; males with wings, and males with homo-specific song playback had a higher insemination success than wingless males (no song) and trials with hetero-specific song. Blood-feeding females prior to the trials increased insemination in all groups including the control group which suggests that mating happens simultaneously with, or immediately after, the blood meal. Blood-fed females also seemed to discriminate less against the wrong song or the lack of song (wingless) one day after feeding, however trials with the correct song still had higher insemination rates. Altogether, our results show that both the male copulatory courtship songs and female blood-feeding are important for reproductive success and as such are important components of the sexual behaviour of L. longipalpis.

**Feasibility of Using a Caribbean Screwworm for SIT Campaigns in Brazil**

Mastrangelo, T; Chaudhury, MF; Skoda, SR; Welch, JB; Sagel, A; Walder, JMM. 2012

The screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), remains one of the most damaging parasites of livestock in South America, causing millions of dollars in annual losses to producers. Recently, South American countries demonstrated interest in controlling this pest using the Sterile Insect Technique, and a pilot-project was conducted near the Brazil-Uruguay border in 2009. Since molecular studies have suggested the existence of C. hominivorax regional groups, crossing tests were conducted to evaluate mating competitiveness, mating preference and reproductive compatibility between a C. hominivorax strain from the Caribbean (Jamaica-06) and one from Brazil. Mating rates between Jamaican males and Brazilian females ranged between 82 and 100%, and each male inseminated from 3.3 to 3.95 females. Sterile males, regardless of the strain, competed equally against the fertile males for Brazilian females. Jamaican sterile males and Brazilian fertile males mated randomly with fertile or sterile females. No evidence of genetic incompatibility or **hybrid** dysgenesis was found in the **hybrid**ization crosses. Mating barriers should not compromise the use of Jamaican sterile males for Sterile Insect Technique campaigns in Brazil.

**Species delimitation and mitonuclear discordance within a species complex of biting midges**

Shults, P; Hopken, M; Eyer, PA; Blumenfeld, A; Mateos, M; Cohnstaedt, LW; Vargo, EL. 2022

The inability to distinguish between species can be a serious problem in groups responsible for pathogen transmission. Culicoides biting midges transmit many pathogenic agents infecting wildlife and livestock. In North America, the C. variipennis species complex contains three currently recognized species, only one of which is a known vector, but limited species-specific characters have hindered vector surveillance. Here, genomic data were used to investigate population structure and genetic differentiation within this species complex. Single nucleotide polymorphism data were generated for 206 individuals originating from 17 locations throughout the United States and Canada. Clustering analyses suggest the occurrence of two additional cryptic species within this complex. All five species were significantly differentiated in both sympatry and allopatry. Evidence of **hybrid**ization was detected in three different species pairings indicating incomplete reproductive isolation. Additionally, COI sequences were used to identify the **hybrid** parentage of these individuals, which illuminated discordance between the divergence of the mitochondrial and nuclear datasets.

**Intraspecific morphological variation of the scorpionfly Dicerapanorpa magna (Chou) (Mecoptera: Panorpidae) based on geometric morphometric analysis of wings**

Liu, M; Ma, N; Hua, BZ. 2016

Wing shape variation was investigated between the sexes and among four populations of the scorpionfly Dicerapanorpa magna (Chou, 1981) endemic to the Qin-Ba Mountains area, China through the landmark-based geometric morphometric approach. The results show that sexual dimorphism exists both in wing size and shape in D. magna. Significant differences exist in female wing size and shape among D. magna populations. The possible reasons of the wing variation are discussed based on the divergence time of D. magna in combination with the tectonic and climatic events in the Qin-Ba Mountains during the late Miocene-Pleistocene period. Whether reproductive isolation exists between different populations needs further research.

**Genetic diversity within and among populations of Diprion pini (Hym., Diprionidae) determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction of haploid males**

Baumann, R; Schubert, R; Heitland, W; Auger-Rozenberg, MA; Faivre-Rimpant, P; Muller-Starck, G. 2003

Based on haploid males, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to study genetic variation within and among four French populations and one Finnish outgroup population of the common pine sawfly, Diprion pini (L.), representing a severe European forest pest associated with mass outbreaks. Taking into account that all multilocus haplotypes were detected, a total of 140 individuals were completely discriminated by means of 17 polymorphic markers (present or absent), which were amplified from nine selected random-decamer primers. All populations shared the same genetic types, but pronounced population-specific frequency distributions were found, indicating that on average 84% of the present genetic variation exists within populations and the remaining smaller part counts for interpopulational variation. The haplotype differentiation registered was able to distinguish between the class of lowland populations and the class of highland populations. Reproductive isolation and therefore limited altitudinal gene flow, indicated in case of a French highland population by an enlarged number of fixed markers, and hitchhiking effects with respect to selective processes at certain loci following local adaptation and speciation are discussed to explain the population structures found. A possible selection is indicated by five markers, showing significantly different frequency distributions between the class of highland populations and the class of lowland populations.

**Colonized Aedes albopictus and its sexual performance in the wild: implications for SIT technology and containment**

Hamady, D; Ruslan, NB; Ahmad, A; Rawi, CSM; Ahmad, H; Satho, T; Miake, F; Zuharah, WF; FuKumitsu, Y; Saad, AR; Rajasaygar, S; Vargas, REM; Ab Majid, AH; Fadzly, N; Abd Ghani, I; AbuBakar, S. 2013

Background: Mating is a physiological process of crucial importance underlying the size and maintenance of mosquito populations. In sterile and incompatible insect technologies (SIT and IIT), mating is essential for mass production, persistence, and success of released individuals, and is a central parameter for judging the effectiveness of SIT/IIT programs. Some mosquitoes have an enormous reproductive potential for both themselves and pathogens and mating may contribute to persistence of infection in nature. As Aedes albopictus can transmit flaviviruses both sexually and horizontally, and as infected insects are usually derived from laboratory colonies, we investigated the implications of mating between a long-term laboratory colony of Ae. albopictus and wild populations. Methods: Through a series of mating experiments, we examined the reproductive outcomes of sexual cross-affinity between laboratory-raised and wild adults of Ae. albopictus. Results: The results indicated appreciable mating compatibility between laboratory-reared and wild adults, and equivalent levels of egg production among reciprocal crosses. We also observed comparable larval eclosion in lab females mated with wild males, and increased adult longevity in female offspring from wild females vertical bar x vertical bar laboratory males crosses. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that Ae. albopictus can preserve its reproductive fitness over a long period of time in the laboratory environment and has valuable attributes for SIT application. These observations together with the ability to successfully inseminate heterospecific females indicate the potential of Ae. albopictus to act as an ecological barrier if non-sterilized males are massively released in areas occupied by Aedes aegypti. The observed substantial reproductive fitness combined with the capability to reproduce both, itself and viruses illustrates the potential of Ae. albopictus to pose a serious threat if infected and released accidentally.

**Strong purifying selection on the Odysseus gene in two clades of sibling species of the Drosophila montium species subgroup**

Wen, SY; Shimada, K; Kawai, K; Toda, MJ. 2006

The Odysseus (OdsH) gene was duplicated from its ancestral neuron-expressed gene, unc-4, and then evolved very rapidly under strong positive Darwinian selection as a speciation gene causing **hybrid**-male sterility between closely related species of the Drosophila simulans clade. Has OdsH also experienced similar positive selection between Drosophila sibling species other than those of the simulans clade? We cloned and sequenced OdsH and unc-4 from two clades of the Drosophila montium species subgroup, the Drosophila lini and the Drosophila kikkawai clades. The ratios of Ka/Ks for OdsH were remarkably low between sibling species of these two clades, suggesting that OdsH has been subjected to strong purifying selection in these two clades.

**The evolution of insect mating structures through sexual selection**

Sirot, LK. 2003

Mating structures are of interest to a wide range of biologists because, in many taxa, mating structures are incredibly diverse and range widely in elaboration even between closely related species. As a result of this diversity, mating structures have been useful in species identification. Historically, the evolution of diverse mating structures has been attributed to post-zygotic selection for pre-zygotic isolation to avoid production of **hybrid** offspring. More recently, sexual selection has been proposed as an alternative explanation for the rapid diversification of mating structures. Mating structures could diversify between populations through sexual selection if sexual selection acted differently on mating structures in different populations. Eberhard (1985) wrote a comprehensive book explaining how sexual selection could result in the diversification of mating structures and providing examples to support the hypothesis, but none of the examples were experimental tests of the hypothesis. Since 1985, a few studies have experimentally tested this hypothesis. However, there have been no empirical studies that connect intraspecific selection with interspecific diversification. In this paper, I review the reproductive isolation and sexual selection hypotheses and two recent experimental tests of the sexual selection hypothesis. Then, I provide a description of a system that may allow one to establish a connection between sexual selection on mating structures within a species and diversification of mating structures between species.

**Comparative analysis of epicuticular lipid profiles of sympatric and allopatric field populations of Anopheles gambiae s.s. molecular forms and An. arabiensis from Burkina Faso (West Africa)**

Caputo, B; Dani, FR; Horne, GL; N'Fale, S; Diabate, A; Turillazzi, S; Coluzzi, M; Costantini, C; Priestman, AA; Petrarca, V; della Torre, A. 2007

We analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) the epicuticular lipid profiles of field females of the major Afro-tropical malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. The samples were collected in three villages in Burkina Faso (West Africa), where An. gambiae M and S molecular forms and An. arabiensis live sympatrically. The aim was to compare the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) composition of individual field specimens of these three taxa, to highlight possible differences among them. All the samples analysed by GC-MS (55 individuals and eight pools) were characterized by the same 48 CHCs and 10 oxygenated compounds. The 19 most abundant CHCs were quantified in 174 specimens by GC-FID: quantitative intra-taxon differences were found between allopatric populations of both An. arabiensis and S-form. Inter-taxa quantitative differences in the relative abundances of some hydrocarbons between pairs of sympatric taxa were also found, which appear to be mainly linked to local situations, with the possible exception of diMeC(35) between An. arabiensis and S-form. Moreover, MeC29 shows some degree of differentiation between S- and M-form in all three villages. Possible causes of these differences are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

**Genetic differentiation of Ganaspis brasiliensis (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) from East and Southeast Asia**

Nomano, FY; Kasuya, N; Matsuura, A; Suwito, A; Mitsui, H; Buffington, ML; Kimura, MT. 2017

Ganaspis brasiliensis (Ihering) (Hymenoptera: Figitidae: Eucoilinae) is a Drosophila parasitoid that has often been misidentified as G. xanthopoda (Ashmead) in recent studies. This study aims to clarify genetic differentiation of G. brasiliensis based on the nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene and three nuclear DNA regions, the inter-transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) and putative 60S ribosomal protein L37 (RpL37), as well as crossing experiments. Four lineages are recognized in individuals assigned as G. basiliensis by morphology, (1) individuals occurring in Japan and probably South Korea, (2) individuals from a small subtropical island of Japan, Iriomote-jima, (3) individuals from temperate lowlands of Japan and high altitude areas of Southeast Asia, and (4) individuals occurring widely in Asia, America, Hawaii and Africa. The first lineage is a specialist of Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), a pest of fresh fruit, and also the fourth lineage has a capacity to parasitize this pest species. The first, third and fourth lineages occur sympatrically at least in Tokyo. The third and fourth lineages differed in mate choice and host use to some extent, but post-mating isolation between them was almost absent.

**Asymmetric Mating Interference between Two Related Mosquito Species: Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus and Aedes (Stegomyia) cretinus**

Giatropoulos, A; Papachristos, DP; Koliopoulos, G; Michaelakis, A; Emmanouel, N. 2015

Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes (Stegomyia) cretinus Edwards are closely related mosquito species with common morphological features and bio-ecological similarities. Recent mosquito surveillance in Athens, Greece, showed that they are sympatric mosquito species, with Ae. Albopictus developing quite higher population densities than Ae. Cretinus. The potential of mating interference between these species was investigated by reciprocal and homologous mating experiments in cages under laboratory conditions. In non-choice interspecific crosses (groups of males and females) females of both species produced sterile eggs. Insemination rate was 58% for Ae. Cretinus females and only 1% for Ae. Albopictus females. Aedes albopictus males were sexually aggressive and inseminated Ae. Cretinus females (31%) in choice experiments, where males of one species had access to mate with females of both species. Whereas, interspecific mating of Ae. Albopictus females with Ae. Cretinus males in the co-occurrence of Ae. Cretinus females was weaker (4%). Aedes cretinus females from non-choice crossing with Ae. Albopictus or Ae. Cretinus males were paired individually with conspecific males. The percentage of fertile Ae. Cretinus females was 17.5% when had encaged before with Ae. Albopictus males, compared to 100% when Ae. Cretinus females were encaged with conspecific males only. Probable ecological consequences of asymmetric mating between these ecologically homologous species in nature are discussed.

**Delineating taxonomic boundaries in the largest species complex of black flies (Simuliidae) in the Oriental Region**

Low, VL; Takaoka, H; Pramual, P; Adler, PH; Ya'cob, Z; Huang, YT; Pham, XD; Ramli, R; Chen, CD; Wannaket, A; Sofian-Azirun, M. 2016

Perspicuous assessments of taxonomic boundaries and discovery of cryptic taxa are of paramount importance in interpreting ecological and evolutionary phenomena among black flies (Simuliidae) and combating associated vector-borne diseases. Simulium tani Takaoka & Davies is the largest and perhaps the most taxonomically challenging species complex of black flies in the Oriental Region. We use a DNA sequence-based method to delineate currently recognized chromosomal and morphological taxa in the S. tani complex on the Southeast Asian mainland and Taiwan, while elucidating their phylogenetic relationships. A molecular approach using multiple genes, coupled with morphological and chromosomal data, supported recognition of cytoform K and morphoform 'b' as valid species; indicated that S. xuandei, cytoform L, and morphoform 'a' contain possible cryptic species; and suggested that cytoform B is in the early stages of reproductive isolation whereas lineage sorting is incomplete in cytoforms A, C, and G.

**The effect of winter length on survival and duration of dormancy of four sympatric species of Rhagoletis exploiting plants with different fruiting phenology**

Rull, J; Tadeo, E; Lasa, R; Aluja, M. 2016

Dormancy has been thoroughly studied for several species of economic importance in the genus Rhagoletis in temperate areas of North America and Europe. Much less is known on life history regulation for species inhabiting high-elevation areas in the subtropics at the southern extreme of their geographical range. Host plant phenology has been found to play a key role in generating allochronic isolation among sibling species and host races of Rhagoletis in the course of sympatric speciation, and has important implications for pest management. We compare the effect of winter length on survival to adult eclosion and dormancy duration among four species of Rhagoletis (three of them sympatric) exploiting hosts with different fruiting phenology in subtropical isolated highlands. Survival and duration of dormancy was found to be different among the four species. At 24 degrees C, a very small proportion (<1%) of R. pomonella, R. turpiniae and R. zoqui completed development without becoming dormant, while in the case of R. solanophaga the majority of the population emerged after development within 40 days of pupation. Also, a large proportion of braconid parasitoids infesting Rhagoletis eggs and larvae emerged as adults without becoming dormant. Greatest survival after artificial winter was obtained for R. pomonella (50-60%) and R. zoqui (30%) after only four weeks at 5 degrees C (a third of the time reported for studies on northern R. pomonella), while R. turpiniae, under identical environmental conditions experienced low adult emergence, and highest survival (11%) was recorded for flies exposed to 5 degrees C during 10 and 12 weeks. For R. pomonella, there was a strong positive relationship between winter length and time to post-winter adult eclosion that was not observed for R. zoqui. In sum, for R. pomonella, mild winters in highland subtropical areas appear to select for flies better able to withstand longer periods of warm temperature before winter than flies exploiting late fruiting hosts and inhabiting northern latitudes. In the case of R. turpiniae and R. zoqui environmental cues such as fluctuations in humidity and/or different temperature thresholds (5 degrees C) may play a more important role than winter length in life history regulation. Continuous host availability for R. solanophaga appears to have selected for non-diapausing flies. From an applied perspective our results are useful for handling flies in the laboratory to conduct research and suggest that non-diapausing strains of flies and parasitoids may be selected for SIT and innundative biological control programs.

**Genetic diversity and population structure of the New World screwworm fly from the Amazon region of Brazil**

Mastrangelo, T; Fresia, P; Lyra, ML; Rodrigues, RA; Azeredo-Espin, AML. 2014

Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) is a myiasis fly that causes economic losses to livestock farmers in warmer American regions. Previous studies of this pest had found population structure at north and south of the Amazon Basin, which was considered to be a barrier to dispersal. The present study analyzed three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers and eight nuclear microsatellite loci to investigate for the first time the genetic diversity and population structure across the Brazilian Amazon region (Amazonia). Both mtDNA and microsatellite data supported the existence of much diversity and significant population structure among nine regional populations of C hominivorax, which was found to be surprisingly common in Amazonia. Forty-six mtDNA haplotypes were identified, of which 39 were novel and seven had previously been found only at south of Amazonia. Seventy microsatellite alleles were identified by size, moderate to high values of heterozygosity were discovered in all regions, and a Bayesian clustering analysis identified four genetic groups that were not geographically distributed. Reproductive compatibility was also investigated by laboratory crossing, but no evidence of **hybrid** dysgenesis was found between an Amazonian colony and one each of from Northeast and Southeast Brazil. The results have important implications for area-wide control by the Sterile Insect Technique. Copyright (C) International Atomic Energy Agency 2014. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

**Significance of constraints on genital coevolution: Why do female Drosophila appear to cooperate with males by accepting harmful matings?**

Kamimura, Y. 2016

The mechanisms driving the coevolution of male and female genital morphologies are still debated. Female genitalia in Drosophila species bear membranous "pouches" or hardened "shields," which the male genital armature contact during copulation. Although shield-like structures likely serve to mitigate the effects of harmful mating, some authors have suggested that soft pouches, which do not prevent male genitalia from inflicting wounds, represent a congruent sensory organ. To elucidate the evolutionary forces responsible for the development of such organs, I examined the effects of artificial damage to various genital parts of female Drosophila erecta on reproductive success. Despite a high survival rate among females, damage to the ovipositor plate resulted in frequent failure of insemination and in the embedment of eggs into the substrate. Damage to the vaginal shield resulted in increased mortality and frequent failure of egg embedment, with an egg blocking the vagina under the damaged shield in some females. Wounding of the pouch had less of an effect on both mating and oviposition success, suggesting that the structure "lures" the male trauma-causing organs to areas where the resultant wounds do not interfere with insemination or oviposition. These data show that the dual functions of female genitalia (mating and oviposition) mediate genital coevolution.

**Molecular Detection and Characterization of Wolbachia pipientis from Culex quinquefasciatus Collected from Lahore, Pakistan**

Sarwar, MS; Jahan, N; Shahbaz, F. 2018

The gram-negative, pleomorphic endosymbiont Wolbachia is known to infect a large number of insects and other arthropods naturally. This bacterium modifies the host biology, mainly causing reproductive alterations including feminization, death of male, parthenogenesis, and importantly cytoplasmic incompatibility. Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility results in nonviable offspring and vector population suppression. In addition, this bacterium rapidly spreads and propagates within the host population. This study is the first report on Wolbachia detection and characterization from Culex quinquefasciatus collected from Lahore, Pakistan. For this purpose, mosquito adults were collected from different localities of Lahore and identified at the species level. A total of 145 pairs of ovaries were individually subjected to DNA isolation, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of three (wsp, 16S rRNA, and ftsZ) genes were investigated. In all, 128 females were found positive, representing 82.3% infection rate. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the detected endosymbiont had 100% homology with Wolbachia pipientis wPip strain and super-group B. The detection of the local strain of Wolbachia (wPip) will be useful in investigating its potential for the control of dengue vector (Aedes aegypti) and reducing dengue transmission in Pakistan.

**Domestication-related changes in sexual performance of Queensland fruit fly**

Perez, J; Mendez, V; Yuval, B; Taylor, PW. 2021

In Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) programs, massive numbers of insects are reared, sterilized, and released in the field to impede reproduction of pest populations. The domestication and rearing processes used to produce insects for SIT programs may have significant evolutionary impacts on life history and reproductive biology. We assessed the effects of domestication on sexual performance of laboratory reared Queensland fruit fly,Bactrocera tryoni, by comparing an old (49 generations) and a young colony (5 generations). We evaluated mating propensity, mating latency, copula duration, sperm transfer, and ability to induce sexual inhibition in mates. Overall, both males and females from the old colony had greater mating propensity than those from the young colony. Copula duration was longer when females were from the old colony. There was no evidence of sexual isolation between the colonies as males and females from the two colonies had similar propensity to mate with flies from either colony. Males from the old colony transferred more sperm regardless of which colony their mate was from. Finally, males from both colonies were similarly able to induce sexual inhibition in their mates and were also similarly able to secure copulations with already-mated females. Positive effects of domestication on sperm transfer, coupled with maintained ability to induce sexual inhibition in mates and to secure copulations with previously mated females, highlights that domestication may have little effect, or even positive effects, on some aspects of sexual performance that may advantage mass-rearedB. tryoniin SIT programs.

**Differences in the reliance on cuticular hydrocarbons as sexual signaling and species discrimination cues in parasitoid wasps**

Buellesbach, J; Vetter, SG; Schmitt, T. 2018

Background: Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) have been documented to play crucial roles as species-and sex-specific cues in the chemical communication systems of a wide variety of insects. However, whether they are sufficient by themselves as the sole cue triggering sexual behavior as well as preference of con-over heterospecific mating partners is rarely assessed. We conducted behavioral assays in three representative species of parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) to determine their reliance on CHC as species-specific sexual signaling cues. Results: We found a surprising degree of either unspecific or insufficient sexual signaling when CHC are singled out as recognition cues. Most strikingly, the cosmopolitan species Nasonia vitripennis, expected to experience enhanced selection pressure to discriminate against other co-occurring parasitoids, did not discriminate against CHC of a partially sympatric species from another genus, Trichomalopsis sarcophagae. Focusing on the latter species, in turn, it became apparent that CHC are even insufficient as the sole cue triggering conspecific sexual behavior, hinting at the requirement of additional, synergistic sexual cues particularly important in this species. Finally, in the phylogenetically and chemically most divergent species Muscidifurax uniraptor, we intriguingly found both CHC-based sexual signaling as well as species discrimination behavior intact although this species is naturally parthenogenetic with sexual reproduction only occurring under laboratory conditions. Conclusions: Our findings implicate a discrepancy in the reliance on and specificity of CHC as sexual cues in our tested parasitioid wasps. CHC profiles were not sufficient for unambiguous discrimination and preference behavior, as demonstrated by clear cross-attraction between some of our tested wasp genera. Moreover, we could show that only in T. sarcophagae, additional behavioral cues need to be present for triggering natural mating behavior, hinting at an interesting shift in signaling hierarchy in this particular species. This demonstrates the importance of integrating multiple, potentially complementary signaling modalities in future studies for a better understanding of their individual contributions to natural sexual communication behavior.

**Phylogenetic relationships among holarctic populations of Chironomus entis and Chironomus plumosus in view of possible horisontal transfer of mitochondrial genes**

Guryev, VP; Blinov, AG. 2002

In eight Holarctic populations of two typical chironomid sibling species of the plumosus group, Chironomus entis and Chironomus plumosus, nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial (cytb) and nuclear (gb2b) gene regions were examined. The phylogenetic trees reflecting the evolutionary histories of the nuclear and mitochondrial markers exhibited significant differences. On the tree based on the nuclear gene sequences the populations clustered according to their species affiliation, whereas on the tree based on the mitochondrial gene sequences the populations were grouped according to their geographic position. This discrepancy is probably explained by mitochondrial gene flow between sympatric species with incomplete reproductive isolation (sibling species). Based on our results together with the earlier data on nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences of some other species from the phylogenetic group plumosus, a scheme of phylogenetic relationships within this group is proposed. This scheme is in many ways different from the traditional view on the evolutionary relationships among species of the plumosus group.

**Incomplete concerted evolution and reproductive isolation at the rDNA locus uncovers nine cryptic species within Anopheles longirostris from Papua New Guinea**

Alquezar, DE; Hemmerter, S; Cooper, RD; Beebe, NW. 2010

Background: Nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes and transcribed spacers are highly utilized as taxonomic markers in metazoans despite the lack of a cohesive understanding of their evolution. Here we follow the evolution of the rDNA second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I subunit in the malaria mosquito Anopheles longirostris from Papua New Guinea (PNG). This morphospecies inhabits a variety of ecological environments indicating that it may comprise a complex of morphologically indistinguishable species. Using collections from over 70 sites in PNG, the mtDNA was assessed via direct DNA sequencing while the ITS2 was assessed at three levels - crude sequence variation through restriction digest, intragenomic copy variant organisation (homogenisation) through heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing via cloning. Results: Genetic evaluation of over 300 individuals revealed that A. longirostris comprises eight ITS2 PCR-RFLP genotypes and nine ITS2 heteroduplex genotypes showing distinct copy variant organization profiles after PCR amplification. Seven of these nine genotypes were found to be sympatric with other genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of cloned ITS2 PCR products and mtDNA COI confirmed all nine clades with evidence of reproductive isolation at the rDNA locus. Compensatory base changes in the ITS2 secondary structure or in pseudoknots were absent when closely related species were assessed. Individuals from each ITS2 genotype showed the same copy variant heteroduplex profile suggesting that the rDNA array is fixed within each genotype. Conclusion: The centromere-proximal position of the rDNA array in Anopheles mosquitoes has probably reduced interchromosomal recombination leaving intrachromosomal events responsible for the observed pattern of concerted evolution we see in these mosquitoes. The stability of these intragenomic ITS2 copy variants within individuals and interbreeding populations suggests that rDNA is moving as a single evolutionary unit through natural populations to fixation and has provided a complementary diagnostic tool to the restriction digest for studying genetic discontinuities and species boundaries. In this, the utility of the ITS2 as a universal taxonomic marker is probably contingent on several factors pertaining to spacer dimensions and the genomic location of the rDNA array with respect to recombination and proximity to regions potentially under selection.

**A test of genomic modularity among life-history adaptations promoting speciation with gene flow**

Ragland, GJ; Doellman, MM; Meyers, PJ; Hood, GR; Egan, SP; Powell, THQ; Hahn, DA; Nosil, P; Feder, JL. 2017

Speciation with gene flow may require adaptive divergence of multiple traits to generate strong ecologically based reproductive isolation. Extensive negative pleiotropy or physical linkage of genes in the wrong phase affecting these diverging traits may therefore hinder speciation, while genetic independence or "modularity" among phenotypic traits may reduce constraints and facilitate divergence. Here, we test whether the genetics underlying two components of diapause life history, initial diapause intensity and diapause termination timing, constrain differentiation between sympatric hawthorn and apple-infesting host races of the fly Rhagoletis pomonella through analysis of 10,256 SNPs measured via genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Loci genetically associated with diapause termination timing were mainly observed for SNPs mapping to chromosomes 1-3 in the genome, most notably for SNPs displaying higher levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD), likely due to inversions. In contrast, selection on initial diapause intensity affected loci on all five major chromosomes of the genome, specifically those showing low levels of LD. This lack of overlap in genetically associated loci suggests that the two diapause phenotypes are largely modular. On chromosome 2, however, intermediate level LD loci and a subgroup of high LD loci displayed significant negative relationships between initial diapause intensity and diapause termination time. These gene regions on chromosome 2 therefore affected both traits, while most regions were largely independent. Moreover, loci associated with both measured traits also tended to exhibit highly divergent allele frequencies between the host races. Thus, the presence of nonover-lapping genetic modules likely facilitates simultaneous, adaptive divergence for the measured life-history components.

**New arrangements on several species subcomplexes of Triatoma genus based on the chromosomal position of ribosomal genes (Hemiptera - Triatominae)**

Pita, S; Lorite, P; Nattero, J; Galvao, C; Alevi, KCC; Teves, SC; Azeredo-Oliveira, MTV; Panzera, F. 2016

The hemipteran subfamily Triatominae includes 150 blood-sucking species, vectors of Chagas disease. By far the most specious genus is Triatoma, assembled in groups, complexes and subcomplexes based on morphological similarities, geographic distribution and genetic data. However, many molecular studies questioned the species integration of several subcomplexes as monophyletic units. In triatomines, chromosomal position of major ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci is extremely variable but seems to be species-specific and an evolutionary conserved genetic trait, so that closely related species tend to have ribosomal clusters in the same chromosomal location. Considering that the autosomal position as the ancestral character for all heteropteran species, including triatomines, we suggest that the movement of rDNA loci from autosomes to sex chromosomes rapidly established reproductive barriers between divergent lineages. We proposed that the rDNA translocation from the autosomes to the sex chromosomes restrict reproductive compatibility and eventually promote speciation processes. We analyzed the chromosomal position of 45S rDNA clusters in almost all species of the matogrossensis, rubrovaria, maculata and sordida subcomplexes. The fluorescent in situ **hybrid**ization results are discussed considering the available genetic data and we proposed new arrangements in the species that constitute each one of these subcomplexes.

**Male diet affects female fitness and sperm competition in human- and bat-associated lineages of the common bedbug, Cimex lectularius**

Kremenova, J; Bartonicka, T; Balvin, O; Massino, C; Reinhardt, K; Sasinkova, M; Weig, AR; Otti, O. 2021

Sperm performance can vary in ecologically divergent populations, but it is often not clear whether the environment per se or genomic differences arising from divergent selection cause the difference. One powerful and easily manipulated environmental effect is diet. Populations of bedbugs (Cimex lectularius) naturally feed either on bat or human blood. These are diverging genetically into a bat-associated and a human-associated lineage. To measure how male diet affects sperm performance, we kept males of two HL and BL populations each on either their own or the foreign diet. Then we investigated male reproductive success in a single mating and sperm competition context. We found that male diet affected female fecundity and changed the outcome of sperm competition, at least in the human lineage. However, this influence of diet on sperm performance was moulded by an interaction. Bat blood generally had a beneficial effect on sperm competitiveness and seemed to be a better food source in both lineages. Few studies have examined the effects of male diet on sperm performance generally, and sperm competition specifically. Our results reinforce the importance to consider the environment in which sperm are produced. In the absence of gene flow, such differences may increase reproductive isolation. In the presence of gene flow, however, the generally better sperm performance after consuming bat blood suggests that the diet is likely to homogenise rather than isolate populations.

**Size and shape differences in genitalia of males from sympatric and reproductively isolated populations of Anthocoris antevolens White (Heteroptera : Anthocoridae) in the Yakima Valley, Washington**

Horton, DR; Lewis, TM. 2005

Anthocoris antevolen. White (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) is a widespread predatory bug in North America commonly associated with deciduous trees and shrubs. Unpublished observations showed that there is considerable geographic variation in male genitalia in this species and that the variation may lead to reproductive isolation among geographically separated populations. We show that male bugs from two sympatric populations in the Yakima Valley, Washington, one occurring on oak (Quercus garryana Douglas) and the other collected from willow (Salix sp.), differed in size and shape of the phallus and clasper. Mating trials showed that males from the oak source successfully inseminated females from the oak source in 75% of pairings; insemination success for males front the willow source paired with females from the willow source was somewhat lower at 62%. In nonlike crosses (oak X willow, willow X oak), males failed to inseminate the female in 100% of pairings, despite vigorous mating attempts by the males. Copulation duration was independent of population source. However, males from the willow source initiated copulation attempts significantly sooner in the assay than males front the oak source, irrespective of female source. We interrupted copulating pairs by freezing them with liquid nitrogen and showed that males in nonlike crosses generally had failed to fully inflate the phallus in the female. Results support statements made elsewhere that A. antevolens is actually composed of in unknown number of reproductively isolated cryptic species.

**Premating isolation is determined by larval rearing substrates in cactophilic Drosophila mojavensis part 6 - Epicuticular hydrocarbon variation in Drosophila mojavensis cluster species**

Etges, WJ; Jackson, LL. 2001

Epicuticular hydrocarbon variation was investigated among the three species of the Drosophila mojavensis cluster (D. mojavensis, D. arizonae, and D. navojoa) within the large D. repleta group. Because these hydrocarbons serve as contact pheromones in adult D. mojavensis, the:chemical characteristics and differences in hydrocarbon profiles in populations of these three sibling species were further investigated. Twenty-seven hydrocarbon components with chain lengths ranging from C-28 to C-40, including n-alkanes, methyl-branched alkanes, n-alkenes, methyl-branched alkenes, and alkadienes were observed. Hydrocarbon profiles among the three species reared on different cactus hosts were easily aligned with previously identified components in D.,mojavensis. Male and female D. navojoa possessed a 31-methyldotricont-6-ene absent in both D. arizonae and D. mojavensis, while lacking the 8,24-tritricontadiene present in these two species. D. navojoa adults had far less 2-methyloctacosane than these sibling species, but the significance of this difference was obscured by the degree of variation among populations in amounts of this hydrocarbon. Mainland and Baja California populations of D. mojavensis were fixed for differences in the amounts 8,24-tritricontadiene, 9,25-pentatricontadiene, and 9,27-heptatricontadiene, consistent with all previous studies. Amounts of 18 of the 27 hydrocarbon components were greater in flies reared on Opuntia cactus. Canonical discriminant function analysis resolved all three species into distinct, nonoverlapping groups, suggesting that epicuticular hydrocarbon profiles are species-specific in the D. mojavensis cluster. Based on the amounts of interpopulation variation in hydrocarbon profiles in these three species, we hypothesize that epicuticular hydrocarbon differences may evolve early during the formation of new species.

**Inter-population mating success in Australian dengue vector mosquitoes: effects of laboratory colonization and implications for the spread of transgenics**

Richardson, AJ; Williams, CR. 2013

Variability between Aedes aegypti populations in north Queensland, Australia, has the potential to impact the successful implementation of new population replacement mosquito releases for dengue control. Four Ae. aegypti colonies originating from different locations (Cairns, Mareeba, Innisfail, and Charters Towers), along with one F1 field-derived population from Cairns, were inter-crossed to determine any incompatibilities in copulation, insemination, and production of viable offspring. Greater copulation and insemination rates were observed when males recently introduced from the wild (Cairns-Wild' population) were mated with long-term laboratory females. Egg viability rates for all crosses ranged from 90.298.2%, with no significant differences observed between crosses. Greater egg production was seen in some populations, and when corrected for wing-length, egg production was greatest in a Mareeba x Innisfail cross (19.55 eggs/mm wing length) and lowest for the Charters Towers intra-population cross (14.35 eggs/mm). Additionally, behavioral differences were observed between laboratory and wild mosquitoes from the Cairns location, suggesting possible laboratory conditioning. Finally, despite controlled larval rearing conditions, size differences between populations existed with Charters Towers mosquitoes consistently smaller than the other populations. The spread of genes or bacterial symbionts between these populations is unlikely to be hindered by pre-existing reproductive barriers.

**Divergence and correlated evolution of male wing spot and courtship display between Drosophila nepalensis and D. trilutea**

Mo, WZ; Li, ZM; Deng, XM; Chen, AL; Ritchie, MG; Yang, DJ; He, ZB; Toda, MJ; Wen, SY. NA

Male-specific wing spots are usually associated with wing displays in the courtship behavior of Drosophila and may play important roles in sexual selection. Two closely related species, D. nepalensis and D. trilutea, differ in wing spots and scissoring behavior. Here, we compare male morphological characters, pigmentation intensity of male wing spots, wing-scissoring behavior, courtship songs, and reproductive isolation between 2 species. F1 fertile females and sterile males result from the cross between females of D. nepalensis and males of D. trilutea. The pigmentation of wing spots is significantly weaker in D. trilutea than in D. nepalensis and the F1 **hybrid**. Males scissor both wings in front of the female during courtship, with a posture spreading wings more widely, and at a faster frequency in D. nepalensis than in D. trilutea and the F1s. Males of D. trilutea vibrate wings to produce 2 types (A and B) of pulse songs, whereas D. nepalensis and the F1s sing only type B songs. The incidence of wing vibration and scissoring during courtship suggests that wing vibration is essential but scissoring is a facultative courtship element for successful mating in both species. The association between the darker wing spots with more elaborate scissoring might be the consequence of correlated evolution of these traits in D. nepalensis; however, D. trilutea retains wing scissoring during courtship despite having weaker pigmentation of wing spots. The genetic architecture of 2 traits differs in the F1s, consistent with maternal or sex-linked effects for spots but nonadditive effects for scissoring.

**Frequency of multiple inseminations in field-collected Anopheles gambiae females revealed by DNA analysis of transferred sperm**

Tripet, F; Toure, YT; Dolo, G; Lanzaro, GC. 2003

We investigated the frequencies of single and multiple matings in field-collected female Anopheles gambiae by conducting microsatellite DNA analyses on the sperm contained within their spermatheca. Amplification by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at four loci allowed the detection of sperm extracts exhibiting more than two alleles per locus, thereby revealing the occurrence of multiple inseminations. Polyandry was found in six of 239 females examined, or 2.5% of the samples. Previous analyses of the molecular form of the sperm and female extracts using a PCR-based diagnostic procedure showed that two of these multiple inseminations involved cross-mating between two chromosomal/molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. Thus polyandry occurred within-form in 1.7% of examined females while other multiple inseminations may be linked to processes of reproductive isolation between forms of An. gambiae.

**Sex aggregation and species segregation cues in swarming mosquitoes: role of ground visual markers**

Poda, SB; Nignan, C; Gnankine, O; Dabire, RK; Diabate, A; Roux, O. NA

Background: Mating swarm segregation in closely related insect species may contribute to reproductive isolation. Visual markers are used for swarm formation; however, it is unknown whether they play a key role in swarm location, species segregation and sex aggregation. Methods: Using two sympatric closely related species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae (s.s.), we investigated in both laboratory and semi-field conditions (i) whether males of the two species use visual markers (black cloths) to locate their swarm; and (ii) whether the presence/absence and size of the marker may differentially affect swarm characteristics. We also investigated whether conspecific virgin females use these markers to join male swarm sites. Results: We showed that males of the two species used visual markers but in different ways: An. coluzzii swarm right above the marker whereas An. gambiae (s.s.) locate their swarm at a constant distance of 76.4 +/- 0.6 cm from a 20 x 20 cm marker in the laboratory setup and at 206 +/- 6 cm from a 60 x 60 cm marker in the semi-field setup. Although increased marker size recruited more mosquitoes and consequently increased the swarm size in the two species, An. coluzzii swarms flew higher and were stretched both vertically and horizontally, while An. gambiae (s.s.) swarms were only stretched horizontally. Virgin females displayed a swarm-like behavior with similar characteristics to their conspecific males. Conclusions: Our results provided experimental evidence that both An. coluzzii and An. gambiae (s.s.) males use ground visual markers to form and locate their swarm at species-specific locations. Moreover, the marker size differentially affected swarm characteristics in the two species. Our results also showed that virgin females displayed a swarm-like behavior. However, these "swarms" could be due to the absence of males in our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the fact that females displayed these "swarms" with the same characteristics as their respective males provided evidence that visual markers are used by the two sexes to join mating spots. Altogether, this suggests that visual markers and the way species and sexes use them could be key cues in species segregation, swarm location and recognition.

**Identification of Host Fruit Volatiles from Snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), Attractive to Rhagoletis zephyria Flies from the Western United States**

Cha, DH; Olsson, SB; Yee, WL; Goughnour, RB; Hood, GR; Mattsson, M; Schwarz, D; Feder, JL; Linn, CE. 2017

A mixture of behaviorally active volatiles was identified from the fruit of snowberry, Symphoricarpos albus laevigatus, for Rhagoletis zephyria flies reared from snowberry fruit. A nine-component blend containing 3-methylbutan-1-ol (3%), dimethyl trisulfide (1%), 1-octen-3-ol (40%), myrcene (8%), nonanal (9%), linalool (13%), (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT, 6%), decanal (15%), and beta-caryophyllene (5%) was identified that gave consistent electroantennogram activity and was behaviorally active in flight tunnel tests. In other flight tunnel assays, snowberry flies from two sites in Washington state, USA, displayed significantly greater levels of upwind oriented flight to sources with the snowberry volatile blend compared with previously identified volatile blends from domestic apple (Malus domestica) and downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) fruit from the eastern USA, and domestic apple, black hawthorn (C. douglasii) and ornamental hawthorn (C. monogyna) from Washington state. Selected subtraction assays showed that whereas removal of DMNT or 1-octen-3ol significantly reduced the level of upwind flight, removal of myrcene and beta-caryophyllene, or dimethyl trisulfide alone did not significantly affect the proportion of upwind flights. Our findings add to previous studies showing that populations of Rhagoletis flies infesting different host fruit are attracted to unique mixtures of volatile compounds specific to their respective host plants. Taken together, the results support the hypothesis that differences among flies in their behavioral responses to host fruit odors represent key adaptations involved in sympatric host plant shifts, contributing to host specific mating and generating prezygotic reproductive isolation among members of the R. pomonella sibling species complex.

**Potential for biocontrol of house flies, Musca domestica, using fungal biopesticides**

Acharya, N; Rajotte, EG; Jenkins, NE; Thomas, MB. 2015

Chemical control of house flies in poultry production facilities is becoming increasingly difficult due to insecticide resistance and regulatory constraints. Biopesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi could provide an alternative approach. Here we evaluated population control potential of two fungal pathogens, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae. Cohorts of adult flies were established in large plastic boxes in the laboratory and were exposed to residues of oil-formulated fungal conidia sprayed on strips of plastic sheeting attached to the box walls. Exposure to the biopesticide barrier treatments caused 100% mortality in adult populations within 8-16 days, depending on the fungal species. In contrast, control flies survived until 96-110 days. Additionally, fungal infections caused 13-20% reduction in egg viability and >70% reduction in fecundity of flies prior to death. The combined lethal and pre-lethal impacts resulted in 21- to 26-fold reduction in basic reproductive rate in the fungus-exposed populations relative to controls. Based on these promising proof-of-principle results, further research is currently under way to determine the feasibility of developing a biopesticide product for operational use.

**Male swarming aggregation pheromones increase female attraction and mating success among multiple African malaria vector mosquito species**

Mozuraitis, R; Hajkazemian, M; Zawada, JW; Szymczak, J; Palsson, K; Sekar, V; Biryukova, I; Friedlander, MR; Koekemoer, LL; Baird, JK; Borg-Karlson, AK; Emami, SN. 2020

Males of the malaria vector speciesAnopheles arabiensisandAnopheles gambiaeproduce and release aggregation pheromones that attract individuals to the swarm, enhancing mating success. The authors argue that manipulating such pheromones could increase the efficacy of malaria-vector control programmes. Accumulating behavioural data indicate that aggregation pheromones may mediate the formation and maintenance of mosquito swarms. However, chemical cues possibly luring mosquitoes to swarms have not been adequately investigated, and the likely molecular incitants of these complex reproductive behaviours remain unknown. Here we show that males of the important malaria vector speciesAnopheles arabiensisandAn. gambiaeproduce and release aggregation pheromones that attract individuals to the swarm and enhance mating success. We found that males of both species released significantly higher amounts of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (acetoin), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (sulcatone), octanal, nonanal and decanal during swarming in the laboratory. Feeding males with stable-isotope-labelled glucose revealed that the males produced these five compounds. A blend composed of synthetic analogues to these swarming odours proved highly attractive to virgin males and females of both species under laboratory conditions and substantially increased mating in five African malaria vectors (An. gambiae,An. coluzzii,An. arabiensis,An. merusandAn. funestus) in semi-field experiments. Our results not only narrow a conspicuous gap in understanding a vital aspect of the chemical ecology of male mosquitoes but also demonstrate fundamental roles of rhythmic and metabolic genes in the physiology and behavioural regulation of these vectors. These identified aggregation pheromones have great potential for exploitation against these highly dangerous insects. Manipulating such pheromones could increase the efficacy of malaria-vector control programmes.

**Allopatric origin of cryptic butterfly species that were discovered feeding on distinct host plants in sympatry**

McBride, CS; Van Velzen, R; Larsen, TB. 2009

Surveys of tropical insects are increasingly uncovering cryptic species - morphologically similar yet reproductively isolated taxa once thought to comprise a single interbreeding entity. The vast majority of such species are described from a single location. This leaves us with little information on geographic range and intraspecific variation and limits our ability to infer the forces responsible for generating such diversity. For example, in herbivorous and parasitic insects, multiple specialists are often discovered within what were thought to be single more generalized species. Host shifts are likely to have contributed to speciation in these cases. But when and where did those shifts occur, and were they facilitated by geographic isolation? We attempted to answer these questions for two cryptic species within the butterfly Cymothoe egesta that were recently discovered on different host plants in central Cameroon. We first used mtDNA markers to separate individuals collected on the two hosts within Cameroon and then extended our analysis to incorporate individuals collected across the entire pan-Afrotropical range of the original taxon. To our surprise, we found that the species are almost entirely allopatric, dividing the original range and overlapping only in the narrow zone of West-Central Africa where they were first discovered in sympatry. This finding, combined with analyses of genetic variation within each butterfly species, strongly suggests that speciation occurred in allopatry, probably during the Pleistocene. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding speciation among other cryptic species recently discovered in the tropics and argue that more work is needed on geographic patterns and host usage in such taxa.

**Host population related variations in circadian clock gene sequences and expression patterns in Chilo suppressalis**

Zhu, L; Feng, S; Gao, Q; Liu, W; Ma, WH; Wang, XP. 2019

The rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis Walker, is one of the most important global agricultural pests. C. suppressalis has distinct rice and water-oat host populations. Asynchrony in sexual activity is thought to be the main factor maintaining reproductive segregation between these populations, particularly the obvious difference in the circadian rhythm of female calling activity between populations. However, the mechanism responsible for this difference in the timing of female calling is poorly understood. The circadian clock is an essential regulator of daily behavioral rhythms in insects, including female calling. We investigated the variation in circadian clock genes of the rice and water-oat populations of C. suppressalis. We did this by comparing deduced amino acid sequences and the expression patterns of seven circadian clock genes (clock, cycle, period, timeless, timeout, cryptochrome1, and cryptochrome2) between females from each population. We found that the two populations had different variants of the timeout and cryptochrome1 genes and differed in the expression of period, timeless and timeout. This suggests that population-related variation in the circadian clock genes period, timeless, timeout and cryptochrome1 could be responsible for the different circadian rhythms of female calling in these host population of C. suppressalis. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying asynchronous sexual activity in insect populations and suggest new topics for future research on the origins and maintenance of population differentiation in insects.

**Hawaiian Drosophila as an Evolutionary Model Clade: Days of Future Past**

O'Grady, P; DeSalle, R. 2018

The Hawaiian Drosophila have been a model system for evolutionary, ecological, and ethological studies since the inception of the Hawaiian Drosophila Project in the 1960s. Here we review the past and present research on this incredible lineage and provide a prospectus for future directions on genomics and microbial interactions. While the number of publications on this group has waxed and waned over the years, we assert that recent systematic, biogeographic, and ecological studies have reinvigorated Hawaiian Drosophila as an evolutionary model system. The characteristics that distinguish good model clades from good model organisms (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster) are somewhat different so we first define what constitutes a good evolutionary model. We argue that the Hawaiian Drosophila possess many desired aspects of a good evolutionary model, describe how this group of geographically isolated flies have been used in the past, and propose some exciting avenues for future evolutionary research on this diverse, dynamic clade of Drosophila.

**Forced-contact mating: A technique for crossing experiments with the fruit fly parasitoid, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera : Braconidae)**

Kitthawee, S. 2008

In this paper, a new technique is described for successfully manipulating the mating of a braconid parasitoid (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) of tephritid fruit flies. This forced-contact-mating technique was first developed for cross-mating experiments to determine the inheritance of winglessness in Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead). Since female D. longicaudata only result from fertilized eggs (unfertilized eggs become males), this mating technique has advantages in the mass production of females for biocontrol releases as well as in investigations on the inheritance of the wingless trait and studies of reproductive isolation among different populations of these parasitoids. Free-mated colonies were generally all winged and predominantly male. Wingless males occurred occasionally but wingless females were rare. Virgin, winged females were immobilized by chilling and placed in close contact With wingless males. Active wingless males readily mounted and mated with immobilized female. Progeny of these mated females were all winged (similar to 83%male and 17% female). When F I females remained unmated they produced both winged and wingless males (similar to 1: 1 ratio) but when immobilized F I females were back-crossed with wingless males, both winged and wingless females (similar to 5:1 ratio) were produced in addition to winged and wingless males. The wingless character was thus determined to be controlled by a recessive gene. Crossing experiments between two different Thai populations of D. longicaudata provided evidence that these populations were reproductively isolated. Among free-mated pairs, some sperm transfer occurred but almost no female progeny were produced. Similarly, among forced-mated pairs, more than double the numbers of females had sperm transferred to their spermatheca, but few female progeny were still produced. This suggests that these two populations are reproductively isolated and are part of a closely related species complex. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

**Hybrid sterility in crosses between two Brazilian sibling species of the Anopheles albitarsis complex**

Fontoura, NG; Araki, AS; Azevedo, RV; Galardo, AKR; Peixoto, AA; Lima, JBP. 2014

Background: Complexes of cryptic species are common in several taxa and this is also the case in the Anopheles genus, a group including all known human malaria vectors. The Anopheles albitarsis complex comprises at least nine cryptic species, some of which are implicated as vectors of human malaria. Several different types of data have been generated for this species complex such as cytogenetics, alloenzymes, morphological and feeding behavioral, **hybrid**ization experiments, RAPD-PCR and RFLP and mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Studies focused on its postzygotic isolation are still somewhat rare in the literature despite their importance to understand the speciation process and the level of gene flow potentially occurring among the different sibling species. Methods: **Hybrid**ization experiments between Anopheles albitarsis s.s. and Anopheles marajoara, as well as backcrosses between **hybrid**s and Anopheles albitarsis s.s., were performed using the induced mating technique. Results were compared to intraspecific crosses. Larva-to-adult viability and sex ratio were also assessed. Results: Male **hybrid**s show very low insemination rates and nearly complete sterility, apparently due to abnormalities in their reproductive organs. Evidence of partial sterility among the **hybrid** females was also observed. Conclusions: Our data indicated that Anopheles albitarsis s.s. and Anopheles marajoara show a high level of postzygotic isolation with a strong **hybrid** male sterility. This result is consistent with the Haldane's rule which states that in interspecific crosses the heterogametic sex is the first to be affected. However, the fact that the females are not completely sterile raises the possibility of introgression between these two siblings species.

**Breeding structure of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva) in Brazil**

Mutebi, JP; Alexander, B; Sherlock, I; Wellington, J; Souza, AA; Shaw, J; Rangel, EF; Lanzaro, GC. 1999

Eleven populations of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva), the sand fly vector of Leishmania chagasi, from different areas of Brazil were analyzed for genetic variation at 16 enzyme loci. In this region, the prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by L. chagasi is spotty and reproductive isolation among populations of Lu. longipalpis has been reported. It is thought that morphologically similar cryptic species with varying vectorial capacity may be responsible for the discontinuous distribution of VL. The aim was to study the genetic structure of populations within this region and to identify demes that may represent sibling species. Genotypic frequencies within populations were in close compliance to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, suggesting there are no sympatric species among these 11 populations. Levels of genetic distance between pairs of populations were very low (< 0.03), consistent with local populations within a single sand fly species. When genotypic frequency data for all populations were pooled, 9 of the 13 polymorphic loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg expectations, indicating some degree of genetic substructuring. Estimates of effective migration rates (N(e)m) among all populations were low, 2.73, suggesting that gene flow is restricted among populations, which is probably the reason for the observed genetic substructuring.

**Sexually antagonistic co-evolution: a model and an empirical test**

Hoyle, A; Gilburn, AS. 2010

Models reveal that sexually antagonistic co-evolution exaggerates female resistance and male persistence traits. Here we adapt an established model by including directional sexual selection acting against persistence. We find similar equilibria to previous models showing that sexually antagonistic co-evolution can be limited by counteracting sexual, as well as, natural selection. We tested the model using empirical data for the seaweed fly, Coelopa ursina, in which body size acts as a persistence and a resistance trait. Our model can generate continuous co-evolutionary cycles and stable equilibria, however, all simulations using empirically derived parameter estimates reach stable equilibria. Thus, stable equilibria might be more common in nature than continuous co-evolutionary cycles, suggesting that sexual conflict is unlikely to promote speciation. The model predicts male biased sexual size dimorphism for C. ursina, comparable with empirically observed values. Male persistence is shown to be more sensitive than female resistance to changes in model parameters.

**Tracking factors modulating cytoplasmic incompatibilities in the mosquito Culex pipiens**

Duron, O; Bernard, C; Unal, S; Berthomieu, A; Berticat, C; Weill, M. 2006

Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria that infect many arthropod species and may induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), resulting in abortive embryonic development. One Wolbachia host, Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes, displays high levels of variability in both CI crossing types (cytotypes) and DNA markers. We report here an analysis of 14 mosquito strains, containing 13 Wolbachia variants, and with 13 different cytotypes. Cytotypes were Wolbachia-dependent, as antibiotic treatment rendered all strains tested compatible. Cytotype distributions were independent of geographical distance between sampling sites and host subspecies, suggesting that Wolbachia does not promote a reproductive isolation depending on these parameters. Backcross analysis demonstrated a mild restoring effect of the nuclear genome, indicating that CI is mostly cytoplasmically determined for some crosses. No correlation was found between the phenotypic and genotypic variability of 16 WO prophage and transposon markers, except for the WO prophage Gp15 gene, which encodes a protein similar to a bacterial virulence factor. However, Gp15 is partially correlated with CI expression, suggesting that it could be just linked to a CI gene.

**Role of X chromosomal song genes in the evolution of species-specific courtship songs in Drosophila virilis group species**

Paallysaho, S; Aspi, J; Liimatainen, JO; Hoikkala, A. 2003

In the Drosophila virilis group the males of the virilis phylad species produce courtship song consisting of pulse trains with no pauses between successive sound pulses, whereas the males of the montana phylad species produce songs with clear pauses between the sound pulses. We obtained song data for F-1 **hybrid**s between D. virilis (representing the virilis phylad) or D. flavomontana (representing the montana phylad) females and the males of several species of the D. virilis group to study the interaction of X chromosomal and autosomal song genes affecting species differences in song. In crosses with D. virilis females, X chromosomal (or maternal) factors masked variation in pulse length despite variation in heterospecific autosomal song genes. To the contrary, in crosses with D. flavomontana females, X chromosomal genes largely determined the pause length and interacted with autosomal genes to determine the pulse length. In the montana phylad species, pulse length showed dominance toward shorter pulses and pause length toward longer pauses. The first-mentioned trait also indicated the epistatic effects of X chromosomal and autosomal components.

**Hoverfly preference for high honeydew amounts creates enemy-free space for aphids colonizing novel host plants**

Vosteen, I; Gershenzon, J; Kunert, G. 2016

1. The existence of an enemy-free space can play an important role in aphid host race formation processes, but little is known about the mechanisms that create an area of low predation pressure on particular host plants. 2. In this paper, we identify a mechanism generating lower predation pressure that promotes the maintenance of the different host races of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) complex, a well-studied model for ecological speciation. The pea aphid consists of at least 15 genetically distinct host races which are native to specific host plants of the legume family, but can all develop on the universal host plant Vicia faba. 3. Previous work showed that hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus) oviposition preferences contribute to the enemy-free space that helps to maintain the different pea aphid host races, and that higher amounts of honeydew are more attractive to ovipositing hoverflies. 4. Here we demonstrated that aphid honeydew is produced in large amounts when aphid reproduction rate was highest, and is an important oviposition cue for hoverflies under field conditions. However, on less suitable host plants, where honeydew production is reduced, pea aphids enjoy lower predation rates. 5. A reduction in enemy pressure can mitigate the performance disadvantages of aphids colonizing a novel host and probably plays an important role in pea aphid host race formation.

**Mosquitoes of the Maculipennis complex in Northern Italy**

Calzolari, M; Desiato, R; Albieri, A; Bellavia, V; Bertola, M; Bonilauri, P; Callegari, E; Canziani, S; Lelli, D; Mosca, A; Mulatti, P; Peletto, S; Ravagnan, S; Roberto, P; Torri, D; Pombi, M; Di Luca, M; Montarsi, F. 2021

The correct identification of mosquito vectors is often hampered by the presence of morphologically indiscernible sibling species. The Maculipennis complex is one of these groups that include both malaria vectors of primary importance and species of low/negligible epidemiological relevance, of which distribution data in Italy are outdated. Our study was aimed at providing an updated distribution of Maculipennis complex in Northern Italy through the sampling and morphological/molecular identification of specimens from five regions. The most abundant species was Anopheles messeae (2032), followed by Anopheles maculipennis s.s. (418), Anopheles atroparvus (28) and Anopheles melanoon (13). Taking advantage of ITS2 barcoding, we were able to finely characterize tested mosquitoes, classifying all the Anopheles messeae specimens as Anopheles daciae, a taxon with debated rank to which we referred as species inquirenda (sp. inq.). The distribution of species was characterized by Ecological Niche Models (ENMs), fed by recorded points of presence. ENMs provided clues on the ecological preferences of the detected species, with An. daciae sp. inq. linked to stable breeding sites and An. maculipennis s.s. more associated to ephemeral breeding sites. We demonstrate that historical Anopheles malaria vectors are still present in Northern Italy.

**Sympatric speciation in phytophagous insects: Moving beyond controversy?**

Berlocher, SH; Feder, JL. 2002

Sympatric speciation is the splitting of one evolutionary lineage into two without the occurrence of geographic isolation. The concept has been intimately tied to entomology since the 1860s, when Benjamin Walsh proposed that many host-specific phytophagous insects originate by shifting and adapting to new host. plant species. If true, sympatric speciation would have tremendous implications for Our understanding of species and their origins, biodiversity (25-40% of all animals are thought to tie phytophagous Specialists), insect-plant coevolution, community ecology, phylogenetics, and systematics, as well as practical significance for the management of insect pests. During much of the twentieth century sympatric speciation. was viewed as much less plausible than geographic (allopatric) speciation. However. empirical field studies, laboratory experiments, developments in population genetics theory, and phylogenetic and biogeographic data have all recently combined to shed a more favorable light on the process. We review the evidence for sympatric speciation via host shifting for phytophagous insects and propose a set of testable predictions for distinguishing geographic mode (allopatric versus sympatric) of divergence, Our conclusion is that sympatric speciation is a viable hypothesis. We. highlight areas where more thorough testing is needed to move sympatric speciation into the realm of accepted scientific theory.

**r/K-like trade-off and voltinism discreteness: The implication to allochronic speciation in the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea complex (Arctiidae)**

Yang, F; Kawabata, E; Tufail, M; Brown, JJ; Takeda, M. 2017

North America has distinct types of Hyphantria moths (Arctiidae) characterized by red (RD)- and black (BL)-headed larvae, of which the taxonomic status is unresolved. Genetic divergence of 26 populations, based on 710bp of the mtCOI sequence, showed two phylogenetic lineages, which could not be connected in the haplotype network with 95% confidence. The two lineages are separated by 3.1% sequence divergence and should be considered for full species status. The estimated split occurred 1.2-1.6million years ago. The range of the RD type covered most of the continent, whereas that of the BL type was limited to eastern deciduous forests. Several biological characteristics were differentiated in the zone of cohabitation where BL had more annual generations than RD. Spring emergence of BL precedes that of RD in the field by at least 1month, because the diapause in BL was shallow, whereas it was deep in RD. Voltinism requires discreteness of numbers, which functions as a sink of **hybrid**s between the two parental lines that have distinct but equally adaptive reproductive strategies; BL may be more r-strategist-like and RD more K-strategist-like, because fast-developing BL has multivoltine life cycle, investing less silk proteins as the round-the-clock feeder, and slow-developing RD univoltine one investing more silk as the nocturnal feeder. Also, intensity of diapause, deep in RD and weak in BL, was grossly different, which may enforce segregation of spring adults. Allochronic speciation avoiding coincidental occurrence of adult stages is therefore the most likely scenario. Because the adults never meet in nature, large morphological differentiation is not required.

**The price of insulation: costs and benefits of feather delivery to nests for male tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor**

Dawson, RD; O'Brien, EL; Mlynowski, TJ. 2011

Many species of birds line their nests with feathers, and it has been hypothesized that this functions to provide a thermally stable microenvironment for the development of eggs and nestlings. Feathers in the nest may also function as a mechanism for parasite control, providing a physical barrier that protects nestlings from ectoparasites. We tested these hypotheses by performing a feather removal and addition experiment in tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, a species well-known for lining their nests with feathers. While we found no evidence that quantity of feathers in nests influenced the ability of females to produce and incubate eggs, offspring in well-feathered nests had longer flight feathers and were structurally larger just prior to fledging that those in nests with fewer feathers. Furthermore, we also demonstrated a positive correlation between feathers and the abundance of larval blow flies Protocalliphora spp. in nests, a result opposite to that predicted by the anti-parasite hypothesis. While our study provides strong support for the insulation hypothesis, we also discuss the possibility that devoting time to feather gathering may result in males losing paternity in their nests, although manipulative studies will be necessary to fully evaluate this idea.

**Discrimination of Eubazus (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) sibling species using geometric morphometrics analysis of wing venation**

Villemant, C; Simbolotti, G; Kenis, M. 2007

Complexes of sibling and cryptic species are encountered frequently in parasitic Hymenoptera. Geometric morphometrics is a useful tool to detect minimal morphological variations, which often are undetectable by traditional morphological studies and even by classical morphometric approaches. We applied geometric morphometrics to wing venation to assess a complex case of sibling species in the genus Eubazus (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), parasitoids of conifer bark weevils of the genus Pissodes (Coleoptera, Curculionidae). The results and methods were compared with previous taxonomic studies on the same species, involving classical multivariate morphometrics, isoenzyme analyses, cross-mating experiments and biological observations. Geometric morphometrics confirmed the previous division into four distinct species. However, this approach enabled the four species to be separated simultaneously, with a reliability of 98.6% for well-classified females and 93.1% for males. A similar result in previous studies was obtained only by combining isoenzyme analyses and several canonical variate analyses, including many morphometric characters. Furthermore, measurements of wing venation were less time-consuming, more reliable and required less prior knowledge of braconid taxonomy than the measurements needed for the classical morphometrics methods. Geometric morphometrics was used also to test the effect of host species on wing shape. Several female populations of Eubazus semirugosus originating from three different Pissodes spp. were compared. Significant differences were found in wing shape between conspecific Eubazus from different host species. The results are discussed in relation to reproductive isolation and genetic flow between the four species.

**Genetic differentiation and cryptic speciation in natural populations of Drosophila lacertosa**

He, LP; Watabe, H; Xiangyu, JG; Gao, JJ; Liang, XC; Aotsuka, T; Zhang, YP. 2007

Drosophila lacertosa, an Oriental member of the robusta species group in the virilis-repleta radiation, has a wide distribution from northern India throughout China to the Far East. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial ND2 gene sequences revealed two genetically significantly diverged lineages with 2.1% DNA sequence divergence. These two lineages are largely allopatric: one is mainly found in southwest China (lineage A), whereas the other ranges central and east of China to northeast Asia (lineage B). The geographic distributions of these two clades narrowly overlap near the provincial boundaries of Yunnan and Guizhou or Guangxi, probably as a consequence of population expansion and secondary contact. These two lineages were estimated to have diverged about 0.56 Mya, and the estimated time of expansion was approximately 70,000 years ago for lineage A population, and 110,000 years ago for lineage B population. The present molecular analysis, together with nearly complete reproductive isolation between those two lineages, strongly suggests that the two lineages might be incipient species.

**Male Genital and Wing Morphology in the Cactophilic Sibling Species Drosophila gouveai and Drosophila antonietae and Their Hybrids Reared in Different Host Plants**

Soto, IM; Soto, EM; Corio, C; Carreira, VP; Manfrin, M; Hasson, E. 2010

Cactophilic Drosophila flies are excellent models to study adaptation to a relatively narrow spectrum of potential host plants and host-driven evolutionary diversification. Previous studies suggested a complex genetic architecture of wing and male genital morphology in phylogenetically basal species of the D. buzzatii cluster. In this work, we investigate the effect of experimental **hybrid**ization and host plant shifts on male genital and wing morphology in D. gouveai Tidon-Sklorz and Sene and D. antonietae Tidon-Sklorz and Sene, a pair of more recently derived species. We explicitly tested the hypotheses that wing and male genital morphology in interspecific **hybrid**s depend on the host plant in which flies were grown. Our study shows that cactus hosts exert a strong effect on genital and wing morphology and that **hybrid**s can be clearly differentiated on the basis of wing and genital morphology from both parental species. However, the extent of morphological differentiation between **hybrid**s and pure species as well as plasticity patterns varied across organs, suggesting a complex genetic architecture for the studied traits.

**Chromosome and Genome Divergence between the Cryptic Eurasian Malaria Vector-Species Anopheles messeae and Anopheles daciae**

Naumenko, AN; Karagodin, DA; Yurchenko, AA; Moskaev, AV; Martin, OI; Baricheva, EM; Sharakhov, IV; Gordeev, MI; Sharakhova, MV. 2020

Chromosomal inversions are important drivers of genome evolution. The Eurasian malaria vector Anopheles messeae has five polymorphic inversions. A cryptic species, An. daciae, has been discriminated from An. messeae based on five fixed nucleotide substitutions in the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA. However, the inversion polymorphism in An. daciae and the genome divergence between these species remain unexplored. In this study, we sequenced the ITS2 region and analyzed the inversion frequencies of 289 Anopheles larvae specimens collected from three locations in the Moscow region. Five individual genomes for each of the two species were sequenced. We determined that An. messeae and An. daciae differ from each other by the frequency of polymorphic inversions. Inversion X1 was fixed in An. messeae but polymorphic in An. daciae populations. The genome sequence comparison demonstrated genome-wide divergence between the species, especially pronounced on the inversion-rich X chromosome (mean Fst = 0.331). The frequency of polymorphic autosomal inversions was higher in An. messeae than in An. daciae. We conclude that the X chromosome inversions play an important role in the genomic differentiation between the species. Our study determined that An. messeae and An. daciae are closely related species with incomplete reproductive isolation.

**THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE, HOST-PLANT PHENOLOGY AND HOST FIDELITY ON THE GENETICS OF APPLE AND HAWTHORN INFESTING RACES OF RHAGOLETIS-POMONELLA**

FEDER, JL; HUNT, TA; BUSH, GL. 1993

True fruit flies belonging to the Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) sibling species complex have been proposed to speciate sympatrically by shifting and adapting to new host plants. Here, we report the results from a series of ecological and genetic experiments conducted at a study site near Grant, Michigan, U.S.A., aimed at clarifying the relationship between host specialization and reproductive isolation for these flies. Our findings indicate that apple (Malus pumila) and hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) infesting populations of R. pomonella are partially allochronically isolated. Differences in the timing of adult eclosion account for part of the allochronic divergence, as apple adults emerge approximately ten days earlier than hawthorn flies in the field. Genetic analyses across different life history stages of the fly show that adults do not randomly move between apple and hawthorn trees, but trend to attack the same species of plant that they infested as larvae. Estimates of interhost migration from the allozyme data suggest that from 2.8 to 10% of the apple population is of hawthorn origin and that over 20% of the hawthorn population is of apple origin. The length and quality of the growing season appear to affect the genetic composition of the host races, as allele frequencies in the hawthorn population are correlated with ambient temperature and rainfall during the spring of the preceding year. Finally, allele frequencies for six allozyme loci displaying host associated differentiation also show significant linear regressions with the timing of adult eclosion within both races. These regressions establish a link between allozyme loci displaying inter-host differentiation and a developmental trait (adult eclosion) responsible for partially isolating the races. The slopes of the regressions are paradoxical, however, as they suggest that apple adults should eclose later, not earlier, than hawthorn flies. We conclude by discussing potential resolutions to the eclosion time paradox.

**Relationships between temperature and life history parameters of Muscidifurax raptorellus (Hymenoptera : Pteromalidae)**

Lysyk, TJ. 2001

The effect of temperature on life history parameters of Muscidifurax raptorellus Kogan & Legner was determined and compared with species currently attacking fly pupae in feedlots and dairies in Alberta. Immature developmental times declined from 72 d at 15 degreesC to 13 d at 30 degreesC for females. Male developmental time averaged 96% of female developmental time. Immature survival ranged from 0.23 at 15 degreesC to 0.93 at 25 degreesC, then declined to 0.492 at 33 degreesC. Emerging wasps averaged 0.60 female, with an average of 8.6 and 6-9 progeny produced per parasitized pupa in Musca domestica L. and Stomoxys calcitrans (L.). Female longevity declined from I I to 5 d as temperatures increased from 15-33 degreesC. Time to 50% progeny production followed a similar pattern. Lifetime progeny production increased from 28-37 progeny per female at 15 degreesC to 85-120 at 20-25 degreesC, then declined to 48-50 progeny per female at 33 degreesC. The net reproductive rate increased from 1.8-2.3 females at 15 degreesC to 39-48 females/female at 25 degreesC, then declined to 13-15 females per female at 33 degreesC. Mean gene-ration time declined with temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase increased from 0.007-0.010 females/female/d at 15 degreesC to 0.203-0.206 females/female/d at 30 degreesC, then declined to 0.173-0.186 females/female/d at 33 degreesC. M raptorellus bad lower lifetime progeny production, net reproductive rate, and intrinsic rate of increase at all temperatures compared with Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders. Life history parameters of M. raptorellus compared favorably to those of Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan and Legner at all but the highest temperatures, and also with those of Trichomalopsis sarcophagae Gahan at all temperatures. It does not appear that there is any climatic barrier to the use of M. raptorellus for inundative, releases for fly control in Alberta.

**Population genetic structure and hybridization patterns in the cryptic sister species Chironomus riparius and Chironomus piger across differentially polluted freshwater systems**

Pedrosa, JAM; Cocchiararo, B; Verdelhos, T; Soares, AMVM; Pestana, JLT; Nowak, C. 2017

Chironomids are an integral and functionally important part of many freshwater ecosystems. Yet, to date, there is limited understanding of their microevolutionary processes under chemically polluted natural environments. In this study, we investigated the genetic variation within populations of the ecotoxicological model species Chironomus riparius and its cryptic sister species Chironomus piger at 18 metal-contaminated and reference sites in northwestern Portugal. Microsatellite analysis was conducted on 909 samples to answer if metal contamination affects genetic variation in natural chironomid populations as previously suggested from controlled laboratory experiments. Similarly high levels of genetic diversity and significant but weak genetic substructuring were found across all sites and temporal replicates, with no effects of metal contamination on the genetic variation or species' abundance, although C. piger tended to be less frequent at highly contaminated sites. Our results indicate that high levels of gene flow and population dynamic processes may overlay potential pollutant effects. At least for our study species, we conclude that the "genetic erosion hypothesis", which suggests that chemical pollution will reduce genome-wide genetic variability in affected populations, does not hold under natural conditions. Interestingly, our study provides evidence of successful **hybrid**ization between the two sister species under natural conditions.

**Swarming behaviour in natural populations of Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii: Review of 4 years survey in rural areas of sympatry, Burkina Faso (West Africa)**

Sawadogo, PS; Namountougou, M; Toe, KH; Rouamba, J; Maiga, H; Ouedraogo, KR; Baldet, T; Gouagna, LC; Kengne, P; Simard, F; Costantini, C; Gibson, G; Diabate, A; Lees, RS; Gilles, JRL; Dabire, KR. 2014

The swarming behaviour of natural populations of Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii (formerly known as An. gambiae S and M forms, respectively) were investigated through longitudinal surveys conducted between July 2006 and October 2009 in two rural areas of south-western Burkina Faso where these forms are sympatric. In both sites, the majority of swarms were recorded above visual markers localised among houses. In Soumousso, a wooded area of savannah, 108 pairs caught in copula from 205 swarms were sampled; in VK7, a rice growing area, 491 couples from 250 swarms were sampled. If segregated swarms were the norm in both sites, many visual markers were shared by the two forms of An. gambiae. Furthermore, mixed swarms were collected annually in frequencies varying from one site to another, though no mixed inseminations were recorded, corroborating the low **hybrid** rate previously reported in the field. The occurrence of inter-specific mate-recognition mechanisms, which allow individuals to avoid **hybrid**isation, is discussed. Copyright (C) International Atomic Energy Agency 2013.

**A REVIEW ON THE POLLINATION OF AROIDS WITH BISEXUAL FLOWERS**

Jimenez, PD; Hentrich, H; Aguilar-Rodriguez, PA; Kromer, T; Chartier, M; MacSwiney, MC; Gibernau, M. 2019

This paper presents an exhaustive review of the current knowledge on pollination of Araceae genera with bisexual flowers. All available studies on floral morphology, flowering sequence, floral scent, floral thermogenesis, floral visitors, and pollinators were carefully examined, with emphasis on the species-rich genera Anthurium Schott, Monstera Adans., and Spathiphyllum Schott. Genera with bisexual flowers are among the early-diverging lineages in Araceae, but present adaptations in their floral ecology to a great variety of pollination vectors, such as bees, beetles, flies, and, unusually, wind. These clades have developed highly derived pollination systems, involving the use of floral scent as a reward. We conclude that floral scent chemistry plays a key role in the pollination biology of the plants and that, in some genera, reproductive isolation through variation in the emitted floral volatile compounds may have been the decisive factor in the speciation processes of sympatric species.

**Cryptic Species of Parasitoids Attacking the Soybean Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Asia: Binodoxys communis and Binodoxys koreanus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae)**

Desneux, N; Stary, P; Delebecque, CJ; Gariepy, TD; Barta, RJ; Hoelmer, KA; Heimpel, GE. 2009

Collections of parasitoids attacking the soybean aphid, Aphis glycine Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in South Korea yielded specimens that were originally identified as Binodoxys communis (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). We report here on laboratory studies indicating that this population is actually a previously unknown species of Binodoxys. Four classes of comparisons were made between the Korean population and a Chinese population that also had been identified as B. communis. The comparisons included 1) mating trials coupled with behavioral observations and spermathecal examinations, 2) assessment of nucleotide divergence at two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene loci, 3) patterns of host use, and 4) reassessment of morphological characters. These studies revealed premating reproductive isolation of the two populations and minor nucleotide differences in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequences and nuclear internal transcriber spacer 1 sequences, providing strong indications that they are different species. Subtle morphological differences also were discovered that confirmed that the Chinese population corresponds to B. communis, whereas the Korean population does not:. We propose the name Binodoxys koreanus Stary, sp. n. for the Korean Population. The two species exhibited similar host ranges in the laboratory, the most notable exception being that B. koreanus, sp. n. is better able to develop in a Population of Aphis craccivora Koch that harbors the bacterial endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa Moran, which seems to strongly interfere with the development of B. communis. We discuss the implications of our results for biological control introductions against the soybean aphid in North America.

**Mayr, Dobzhansky, and Bush and the complexities of sympatric speciation in Rhagoletis**

Feder, JL; Xie, XF; Rull, J; Velez, S; Forbes, A; Leung, B; Dambroski, H; Filchak, KE; Aluja, M. 2005

The Rhagoletis pomonella sibling species complex is a model for sympatric speciation by means of host plant shifting. However, genetic variation aiding the sympatric radiation of the group in the United States may have geographic roots. Inversions on chromosomes 1-3 affecting diapause traits adapting flies to differences in host fruiting phenology appear to exist in the United States because of a series of secondary introgression events from Mexico. Here, we investigate whether these inverted regions of the genome may have subsequently evolved to become more recalcitrant to introgression relative to collinear regions, consistent with new models for chromosomal speciation. As predicted by the models, gene trees for six nuclear loci mapping to chromosomes other than 1-3 tended to have shallower node depths separating Mexican and U.S. haplotypes relative to an outgroup sequence than nine genes residing on chromosomes 1-3. We discuss the implications of secondary contact and differential introgression with respect to sympatric host race formation and speciation in Rhagoletis, reconciling some of the seemingly dichotomous views of Mayr, Dobzhansky, and Bush concerning modes of divergence.

**Morphological Differentiation May Mediate Mate-Choice between Incipient Species of Anopheles gambiae s.s.**

Sanford, MR; Demirci, B; Marsden, CD; Lee, Y; Cornel, AJ; Lanzaro, GC. 2011

The M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s. have been considered incipient species for more than ten years, yet the mechanism underlying assortative mating of these incipient species has remained elusive. The discovery of the importance of harmonic convergence of wing beat frequency in mosquito mating and its relation to wing size have laid the foundation for exploring phenotypic divergence in wing size of wild populations of the two forms. In this study, wings from field collected mosquitoes were measured for wing length and wing width from two parts of the sympatric distribution, which differ with respect to the strength of assortative mating. In Mali, where assortative mating is strong, as evidenced by low rates of **hybrid**ization, mean wing lengths and wing widths were significantly larger than those from Guinea-Bissau. In addition, mean wing widths in Mali were significantly different between molecular forms. In Guinea-Bissau, assortative mating appears comparatively reduced and wing lengths and widths did not differ significantly between molecular forms. The data presented in this study support the hypothesis that wing beat frequency may mediate assortative mating in the incipient species of A. gambiae and represent the first documentation of a morphological difference between the M and S molecular forms.

**Population structure of Wolbachia and cytoplasmic introgression in a complex of mosquito species**

Dumas, E; Atyame, CM; Milesi, P; Fonseca, DM; Shaikevich, EV; Unal, S; Makoundou, P; Weill, M; Duron, O. 2013

Background: The maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia often acts as a subtle parasite that manipulates insect reproduction, resulting potentially in reproductive isolation between host populations. Whilst distinct Wolbachia strains are documented in a group of evolutionarily closely related mosquitoes known as the Culex pipiens complex, their impact on mosquito population genetics remains unclear. To this aim, we developed a PCR-RFLP test that discriminates the five known Wolbachia groups found in this host complex. We further examined the Wolbachia genetic diversity, the variability in the coinherited host mitochondria and their partitioning among members of the Cx. pipiens complex, in order to assess the impact of Wolbachia on host population structure. Results: There was a strong association between Wolbachia and mitochondrial haplotypes indicating a stable co-transmission in mosquito populations. Despite evidence that members of the Cx. pipiens complex are genetically distinct on the basis of nuclear DNA, the association of Wolbachia and mtDNA with members of the Cx. pipiens complex were limited. The Wolbachia wPip-I group, by far the most common, was associated with divergent Cx. pipiens members, including Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. pipiens pipiens form pipiens and Cx. pipiens pipiens form molestus. Four other wPip groups were also found in mosquito populations and all were shared between diverse Cx. pipiens members. Conclusion: This data overall supports the hypothesis that wPip infections, and their allied mitochondria, are associated with regular transfers between Cx. pipiens members rather than specific host associations. Overall, this is suggestive of a recent and likely ongoing cytoplasmic introgression through **hybrid**ization events across the Cx. pipiens complex.

**Pre-copula acoustic behaviour of males in the malarial mosquitoes Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae s.s. does not contribute to reproductive isolation**

Simoes, PMV; Gibson, G; Russell, IJ. 2017

We reveal that males of two members of the Anopheles gambiae s. l. species complex, Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae s. s. (hereafter A. gambiae), which are both malaria vectors, perform a stereotypical acoustic behaviour in response to pure tones at frequencies that encompass the frequency range of the female's flight-tones. This behaviour resembles that described for Culex quinquefasciatus and consists of phonotactic flight initiated by a steep increase in wing-beat frequency (WBF) followed by rapid frequency modulation (RFM) of WBF when in close proximity to the sound source. RFM was elicited without acoustic feedback or the presence of a live female, but it appears to be a stereotypic behaviour in the immediate lead up to copula formation. RFM is an independent and different behavioural process from harmonic convergence interactions used by male-female pairs for mate recognition at earlier stages of mating. Acoustic threshold for RFM was used to plot behavioural audiograms from free-flying A. coluzzii and A. gambiae males. These audiograms were almost identical (minima similar to 400 Hz) and encompassed the WBF ranges of A. coluzzii (378-601 Hz) and A. gambiae (373-590 Hz) females, indicating that males of the two species share similar frequency tuning and range. Furthermore, no differences were found between the two species in their WBFs, RFM behaviour or harmonic convergence ratios. These results indicate that assortativemating between A. coluzzii and A. gambiae is unlikely to be based on male-specific acoustic behaviours during RFM. The significance of these findings in relation to possible mechanisms for assortative mating is discussed.

**A phylogenetic examination of host use evolution in the quinaria and testacea groups of Drosophila**

Chialvo, CHS; White, BE; Reed, LK; Dyer, KA. 2019

Adaptive radiations provide an opportunity to examine complex evolutionary processes such as ecological specialization and speciation. While a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis is critical to completing such studies, the rapid rates of evolution in these groups can impede phylogenetic studies. Here we study the quinaria and testacea species groups of the immigrans-tripunctata radiation of Drosophila, which represent a recent adaptive radiation and are a developing model system for ecological genetics. We were especially interested in understanding host use evolution in these species. In order to infer a phylogenetic hypothesis for this group we sampled loci from both the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial DNA to develop a dataset of 43 protein-coding loci for these two groups along with their close relatives in the immigrans-tripunctata radiation. We used this dataset to examine their evolutionary relationships along with the evolution of feeding behavior. Our analysis recovers strong support for the monophyly of the testacea but not the quinaria group. Results from our ancestral state reconstruction analysis suggests that the ancestor of the testacea and quinaria groups exhibited mushroom-feeding. Within the quinaria group, we infer that transition to vegetative feeding occurred twice, and that this transition did not coincide with a genome-wide change in the rate of protein evolution.

**Sexual Selection and the Evolution of Mating Systems in Mosquitoes**

South, A; Catteruccia, F. 2016

While Darwin first conceptualized the connection between morphological trait variation across related taxa and mating system evolution nearly 150 years ago, a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between genes, physiology and behaviour across species has only recently become possible through remarkable progress in genetics and molecular biology. With their extensive diversification, ecological variation and burgeoning genomic resources, mosquitoes are an ideal group to identify patterns of trait variation and suggest causal evolutionary mechanisms. Here we discuss the mating systems of Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, vectors of major infectious diseases that afflict humanity. In this review, our emphasis is on interspecific comparisons of traits relevant to mechanisms of pre- and postcopulatory selection, including mating behaviour, molecular pathways of reproduction, postmating physiology and morphological traits. Based on a wealth of recent studies in mosquito genomics and phylogenetics, we provide an evolutionary context to examine adaptive changes in mosquito reproduction, their possible impact on pathogen transmission and their potential consequences for disease control.

**Evolutionary history of a mosquito endosymbiont revealed through mitochondrial hitchhiking**

Rasgon, JL; Cornel, AJ; Scott, TW. 2006

Due to cytoplasmic inheritance, spread of maternally inherited Wolbachia symbionts can result in reduction of mitochondrial variation in populations. We examined sequence diversity of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) gene in Wolbachia-infected (South Africa (SA), California and Thailand) and uninfected (SA) Culex pipiens complex populations. In total, we identified 12 haplotypes (A-L). In infected populations, 99% of individuals had haplotype K. In the uninfected SA population, 11 haplotypes were present, including K. Nuclear allozyme diversity was similar between infected and uninfected SA populations. Analysis of nuclear DNA sequences suggested that haplotype K presence in uninfected SA Cx. pipiens was probably due to a shared ancestral polymorphism rather than **hybrid** introgression. These data indicate that Wolbachia spread has resulted in drastic reduction of mitochondrial variability in widely separated Cx. pipiens complex populations. In contrast, the uninfected SA population is probably a cryptic species where Wolbachia introgression has been prevented by reproductive isolation, maintaining ancestral levels of mitochondrial diversity. Molecular clock analyses suggest that the Wolbachia sweep occurred within the last 47 000 years. The effect of Wolbachia on mitochondrial dynamics can provide insight on the potential for Wolbachia to spread transgenes into mosquito populations to control vector-borne diseases.

**Integration of molecular, ecological, morphological and endosymbiont data for species delimitation within the Pnigalio soemius complex (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)**

Gebiola, M; Gomez-Zurita, J; Monti, MM; Navone, P; Bernardo, U. 2012

Integrative taxonomy is a recently developed approach that uses multiple lines of evidence such as molecular, morphological, ecological and geographical data to test species limits, and it stands as one of the most promising approaches to species delimitation in taxonomically difficult groups. The Pnigalio soemius complex (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) represents an interesting taxonomical and ecological study case, as it is characterized by a lack of informative morphological characters, deep mitochondrial divergence, and is susceptible to infection by parthenogenesis-inducing Rickettsia. We tested the effectiveness of an integrative taxonomy approach in delimiting species within the P. soemius complex. We analysed two molecular markers (COI and ITS2) using different methods, performed multivariate analysis on morphometric data and exploited ecological data such as hostplant system associations, geographical separation, and the prevalence, type and effects of endosymbiont infection. The challenge of resolving different levels of resolution in the data was met by setting up a formal procedure of data integration within and between conflicting independent lines of evidence. An iterative corroboration process of multiple sources of data eventually indicated the existence of several cryptic species that can be treated as stable taxonomic hypotheses. Furthermore, the integrative approach confirmed a trend towards host specificity within the presumed polyphagous P. soemius and suggested that Rickettsia could have played a major role in the reproductive isolation and genetic diversification of at least two species.

**COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS IN THREE SIBLING SPECIES OF THE DROSOPHILA VIRILIS GROUP**

Belkina, EG; Vedenina, VY; Sorokina, SY; Lazebny, OE. 2018

Courtship behavior was studied in three sibling species of the Drosophila virilis group, namely, D. virilis, D. lummei, and D. littoralis. The latter species was represented by two strains, the founders of which had been caught in the habitats of the southern and northern races of D. littoralis, whose status is equivalent to subspecies. Con- and heterospecific tests were analyzed by video-typing. Analyses of conspecific tests of D. virilis and D. lummei revealed no differences in the duration of courtship elements and their latencies. Conversely, a comparison of heterospecific tests female D. virilis + male D. lummei and female D. lummei + male D. virilis showed a strong decrease in the duration of all main courtship elements (touching, licking, and singing), as well as a significant decrease in the percentage of copulation. Comparisons of the con- and heterospecific tests of the northern and southern races of D. littoralis revealed some differences in courtship structure. However, we did not find any obstacles for a successful mating in the heterospecific tests of the northern and southern races of D. littoralis. By contrast, large differences in the structure of the courtship ritual in heterospecific reciprocal tests of D. littoralis + D. virilis and D. littoralis + D. lummei were found. The males of the D. virilis phylad lost their interest to D. littoralis females immediately after the beginning of touching. On the contrary, D. littoralis males demonstrated a complete courtship towards both D. lummei and D. virilis females. At the same time, all heterospecific tests of D. lummei + D. littoralis and D. virilis + D. littoralis were characterized by the lowest percent of copulation.

**Differential gene expression in incipient species of Anopheles gambiae**

Cassone, BJ; Mouline, K; Hahn, MW; White, BJ; Pombi, M; Simard, F; Costantini, C; Besansky, NJ. 2008

A speciation process is ongoing in the primary vector of malaria in Africa, Anopheles gambiae. Assortatively mating incipient species known as the M and S forms differentially exploit larval breeding sites associated with different ecological settings. However, some ongoing gene flow between M and S limits significant genomic differentiation mainly to small centromere-proximal regions on chromosomes X and 2L, termed 'speciation islands' with the expectation that they contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation. As the speciation islands exhibit reduced recombination and low polymorphism, more detailed genetic analysis using fine-scale mapping is impractical. We measured global gene expression differences between M and S using oligonucleotide microarrays, with the goal of identifying candidate genes that could be involved in this ongoing speciation process. Gene expression profiles were examined in two independent colonies of both forms at each of three developmental periods of interest: fourth instar larvae, virgin females, and gravid females. Patterns were validated on a subset of genes using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of RNA samples from laboratory colonies and wild mosquitoes collected from Cameroon and Burkina Faso. Considered across all three developmental periods, differentially expressed genes represented similar to 1-2% of all expressed genes. Although disproportionately represented in the X speciation island, the vast majority of genes were located outside any speciation island. Compared to samples from the other developmental periods, virgin females were characterized by more than twice as many differentially expressed genes, most notably those implicated in olfaction and potentially, mate recognition.

**Description of the ovarian microbiota of Aedes aegypti (L) Rockefeller strain**

Alvarado, WA; Agudelo, SO; Velez, ID; Vivero, RJ. 2021

Aedes aegypti is one of the vectors responsible for transmitting the viruses that cause dengue, Zika and chikungunya in the human population. Mosquitoes have bacterial communities in different organs, mainly in the midgut, but to a lesser extent in their reproductive organs, such as the ovaries, where replication and vertical transmission is decisive for dengue virus. These bacteria also influence metabolic and physiological processes such as ingestion and digestion of blood. In this study, aerobic bacterial communities associated with ovaries of A. aegypti Rockefeller strain were determined, describing their potential function during ovocitary development. The groups of mosquitoes were separated into three treatments: diet with 10% sugar solution, diet with blood supply, and blood feeding combined with tetracycline. The ovaries were extracted from the mosquitoes, and then put in enriched culture media (blood and nutritive agar) by direct inoculation, for subsequent isolation and macroscopic and microscopic characterization of the colonies. The taxonomic determination of bacterial isolates was achieved by sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. A higher bacterial load was observed in the sugar feeding group (6 x 10(3) CFU/ml) in contrast to the group fed only with blood, with and without an antibiotic (4.03-4.04 x 10(3)CFU/ml; 4.85-5.04 x 10(3)CFU/ml). As a result, a total of 35 colonies were isolated, of which 80% were gram-negative and 20% gram-positive; 72% were lactose negative and 8% lactose positive. Of the total bacteria, 83% had gamma hemolysis, 17% alpha hemolysis, and none presented beta hemolysis. After phenotypic and biochemical characterization, 17 isolates were selected for molecular identification. Only phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were found. Bacteria associated with ovaries of A. aegypti were mainly identified as belonging to the Serratia and Klebsiella genera. Some bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Pantoea dispersa and Klebsiella oxytoca) have wide biotechnological potential due to their entomopathogenic power and their bioactivity against different pathogens.

**Isolation in Natural Host Cell Lines of Wolbachia Strains wPip from the Mosquito Culex pipiens and wPap from the Sand Fly Phlebotomus papatasi**

Bell-Sakyi, L; Beliavskaia, A; Hartley, CS; Jones, L; Luu, L; Haines, LR; Hamilton, JGC; Darby, AC; Makepeace, BL. 2021

Simple Summary</p> Diverse strains of Wolbachia bacteria, carried by many arthropods, as well as some nematodes, interact in many different ways with their hosts. These include male killing, reproductive incompatibility, nutritional supplementation and suppression or enhancement of the transmission of diseases such as dengue and malaria. Consequently, Wolbachia have an important role to play in novel strategies to control human and livestock diseases and their vectors. Similarly, cell lines derived from insect hosts of Wolbachia constitute valuable research tools in this field. During the generation of novel cell lines from mosquito and sand fly vectors, we isolated two strains of Wolbachia and demonstrated their infectivity for cells from a range of other insects and ticks. These new insect cell lines and Wolbachia strains will aid in the fight against mosquitoes, sand flies and, potentially, ticks and the diseases that these arthropods transmit to humans and their domestic animals.</p> Endosymbiotic intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are harboured by many species of invertebrates. They display a wide range of developmental, metabolic and nutritional interactions with their hosts and may impact the transmission of arboviruses and protozoan parasites. Wolbachia have occasionally been isolated during insect cell line generation. Here, we report the isolation of two strains of Wolbachia, wPip and wPap, during cell line generation from their respective hosts, the mosquito Culex pipiens and the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi. wPip was pathogenic for both new C. pipiens cell lines, CPE/LULS50 and CLP/LULS56, requiring tetracycline treatment to rescue the lines. In contrast, wPap was tolerated by the P. papatasi cell line PPL/LULS49, although tetracycline treatment was applied to generate a Wolbachia-free subline. Both Wolbachia strains were infective for a panel of heterologous insect and tick cell lines, including two novel lines generated from the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, LLE/LULS45 and LLL/LULS52. In all cases, wPip was more pathogenic for the host cells than wPap. These newly isolated Wolbachia strains, and the novel mosquito and sand fly cell lines reported here, will add to the resources available for research on host-endosymbiont relationships, as well as on C. pipiens, P. papatasi, L. longipalpis and the pathogens that they transmit.</p>

**Production and evolution pattern of "fruity smell" aggregation pheromones in genusDrosophila**

Zhang, WF; Liu, LM; He, S; Lu, BY; Luo, YB. 2022

Insects produce pheromones to serve a range of ecological functions throughout their lifetime. The chemical composition, production pattern, and interspecies specificity provide information for carrying out their function and biological significance. Several species ofDrosophilaproduce a class of volatile esters considered as "fruity smells"; however, the production pattern and ecological functions of these "fruity smell" volatiles in genusDrosophilaare poorly understood. Here, using the headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method, we tested the production pattern of volatile pheromones inDrosophila immigransand factors that possibly affected pheromone production, including mating, feeding conditions, age of adult flies, and geographical distribution. We also explored the evolution and production pattern of volatile pheromones in 14 species of genusDrosophila. Our result showed that maleD. immigransadult flies produce three male-specific volatile ester pheromones, which are also considered as "fruity smell" chemicals, in a relatively stable pattern. In addition, a series of "fruity smell" ester pheromones with similar structure and chemical properties were found to appear in the species ofD. virilisandD. immigransspecies group, but not in the species ofD. melanogasterspecies group. The ester volatile pheromone production of male flies has a correspondence with the female's demand for host plants. Integrating the production and evolution pattern of these volatile chemicals, we inferred the interaction between insects and host plants reflected in theDrosophila"fruity smell" pheromones.

**The role of fetid olfactory signals in the shift to saprophilous fly pollination in Jaborosa (Solanaceae)**

More, M; Mulieri, P; Battan-Horenstein, M; Cocucci, AA; Raguso, RA. 2019

Floral scents can act as important contributing factors to plant reproductive isolation mediated by pollinators. Plants may utilize fetid floral odors that specifically lure saprophilous flies seeking high protein content substrates, such as dung or carrion, to reach sexual maturity or as food sources for their larvae. In this work, we used baits with fetid volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are produced during the decay of animal protein substrates (oligosulfides and a fermented bone-meal blend) to evaluate the role that olfactory signals may have played in the shift to saprophilous fly pollination in species of the nightshade genus Jaborosa Juss. Traps with the fetid baits attracted the same assemblage of saprophilous fly species that were recorded pollinating the flowers in different populations of the Andean-distributed species J. laciniata, whereas no flies were attracted to the control traps using mineral oil. Furthermore, the addition of oligosulfides to flowers of J. integrifolia, a lowland distributed species pollinated by nocturnal hawkmoths, resulted in the nearly immediate attraction of saprophilous flies (mainly Calliphoridae) to the flowers. These results provide evidence that the emission of fetid floral VOCs is sufficient to attract flies to flowers irrespective of other flower features and geographic region. This suggests that the evolutionary shift to saprophilous fly pollination in the genus Jaborosa could have been initiated with novel floral visitors attracted by the emission of fetid VOCs and then followed by major changes in other flower traits such as corolla color and morphology to optimize pollen export and placement.

**Characterization and Host-Feeding Patterns of Culex pipiens s.l. Taxa in a West Nile Virus-Endemic Area in Southeastern Romania**

Tiron, GV; Stancu, IG; Dinu, S; Prioteasa, FL; Falcuta, E; Ceianu, CS; Cotar, AI. 2021

Culex pipiens sensu lato has been documented as West Nile virus (WNV) vector in southeastern Romania. Bucharest, the densely populated capital city of Romania, and the surrounding Ilfov county are WNV hotspots. In this area, the morphologically indistinguishable biotypes of Cx. pipiens, namely pipiens and molestus, are usually differentiated by their behavioral and physiological traits. Their involvement in WNV transmission, as suggested by entomological investigations, was not previously documented for each biotype. We used a Real-Time PCR assay based on CQ11 microsatellite to identify the Cx. pipiens biotypes and their **hybrid**s collected in various habitats in the Bucharest metropolitan area. A sympatric distribution of both biotypes was observed, with a preference of green areas for pipiens, and human settings and animal farmlands for molestus. In the latter habitats, pipiens and molestus were found in mixed aboveground populations. A low number of **hybrid**s was found suggesting existence of reproductive isolation. In subway tunnels molestus was dominant with a higher number of **hybrid**s recorded than aboveground. Blood-engorged mosquitoes were identified to biotype and the blood meal source identified by DNA barcoding. Overall, Cx. pipiens s.l. fed mainly on birds, commonly on house sparrows, collared doves, and blackbirds, which are potential WNV-amplifying hosts. The preference for avian hosts was expressed strongest by pipiens biotype, while molestus was substantially less specific, feeding on avian and mammal hosts with similar frequency, with humans representing 20% of the hosts. **Hybrid**s had a host choice closer to that of molestus. These findings highlight the role of pipiens biotype as enzootic/epizootic vector, and specifically show molestus as the bridge vector for WNV. The pipiens and molestus biotypes show important differences in habitat preferences, including oviposition; these findings demonstrate that targeted mosquito control to limit WNV transmission may be possible.

**Origin and status of Culex pipiens mosquito ecotypes**

Haba, Y; McBride, L. 2022

The northern house mosquito Culex pipiens sensu stricto is one of the most important disease vector mosquitoes in temperate zones across the northern hemisphere, responsible for the emergence of West Nile Virus over the last two decades. It comprises two ecologically distinct forms- an aboveground form, pipiens, diapauses in winter and primarily bites birds, while a belowground form, molestus, thrives year-round in subways, basements and other human-made, belowground habitats, bites mammals, and can even lay eggs without a blood meal. The two forms **hybrid**ize in some but not all places, leading to a complex ecological mosaic that complicates predictions of vectorial capacity. Moreover, the origin of the belowground molestus is contentious, with iconic populations from the London Underground subway system being held up by evolutionary biologists as a preeminent example of rapid, in situ, urban adaptation and speciation. We review the recent and historical literature on the origin and ecology of this important mosquito and its enigmatic forms. A synthesis of genetic and ecological studies spanning 100+ years clarifies a striking latitudinal gradient - behaviorally divergent and reproductively isolated forms in northern Europe gradually break down into what appear to be well-mixed, intermediate populations in North Africa. Moreover, a continuous narrative thread dating back to the original description of form molestus in Egypt in 1775 refutes the popular idea that belowground mosquitoes in London evolved in situ from their aboveground counterparts. These enigmatic mosquitoes are more likely derived from populations in the Middle East, where human-biting and other adaptations to human environments may have evolved on the timescale of millennia rather than centuries. We outline several areas for future work and discuss the implications of these patterns for public health and for our understanding of urban adaptation in the Anthropocene.

**SEX-SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION: EVOLUTION OF REACTION NORMS AND STATIC ALLOMETRIES IN NERIID FLIES**

Cassidy, EJ; Bath, E; Chenoweth, SF; Bonduriansky, R. 2014

The consequences of sex-specific selection for patterns of diversification remain poorly known. Because male secondary sexual traits are typically costly to express, and both costs and benefits are likely to depend on ambient environment and individual condition, such traits may be expected to diversify via changes in reaction norms as well as the scaling of trait size with body size (static allometry). We investigated morphological diversification within two species of Australian neriid flies (Telostylinus angusticollis, Telostylinus lineolatus) by rearing larvae from several populations on larval diets varying sixfold in nutrient concentration. Mean body size varied among populations of T. angusticollis, but body size reaction norms did not vary within either species. However, we detected diversification of reaction norms for body shape in males and females within both species. Moreover, unlike females, males also diversified in static allometry slope and reaction norms for static allometry slope of sexual and nonsexual traits. Our findings reveal qualitative sex differences in patterns of morphological diversification, whereby shape-size relationships diversify extensively in males, but remain conserved in females despite extensive evolution of trait means. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating plasticity and allometry in studies of adaptation and diversification.

**Acoustic communication in insect disease vectors**

Vigoder, FDM; Ritchie, MG; Gibson, G; Peixoto, AA. 2013

Acoustic signalling has been extensively studied in insect species, which has led to a better understanding of sexual communication, sexual selection and modes of speciation. The significance of acoustic signals for a blood-sucking insect was first reported in the XIX century by Christopher Johnston, studying the hearing organs of mosquitoes, but has received relatively little attention in other disease vectors until recently. Acoustic signals are often associated with mating behaviour and sexual selection and changes in signalling can lead to rapid evolutionary divergence and may ultimately contribute to the process of speciation. Songs can also have implications for the success of novel methods of disease control such as determining the mating competitiveness of modified insects used for mass-release control programs. Species-specific sound "signatures" may help identify incipient species within species complexes that may be of epidemiological significance, e. g. of higher vectorial capacity, thereby enabling the application of more focussed control measures to optimise the reduction of pathogen transmission. Although the study of acoustic communication in insect vectors has been relatively limited, this review of research demonstrates their value as models for understanding both the functional and evolutionary significance of acoustic communication in insects.

**Diversity and distribution of Wolbachia in relation to geography, host plant affiliation and life cycle of a heterogonic gall wasp**

Schuler, H; Egan, SP; Hood, GR; Busbee, RW; Driscoe, AL; Ott, JR. 2018

Background: The maternally inherited endosymbiont Wolbachia is widespread in arthropods and nematodes and can play an important role in the ecology and evolution of its host through reproductive manipulation. Here, we survey Wolbachia in Belonocnema treatae, a widely distributed North American cynipid gall forming wasp that exhibits regional host specialization on three species of oaks and alternation of sexually and asexually reproducing generations. We investigated whether patterns of Wolbachia infection and diversity in B. treatae are associated with the insect's geographic distribution, host plant association, life cycle, and mitochondrial evolutionary history. Results: Screening of 463 individuals from 23 populations including sexual and asexual generations from all three host plants across the southern U.S. showed an average infection rate of 56% with three common Wolbachia strains: wTre1-3 and an additional rare variant wTre4. Phylogenetic analysis based on wsp showed that these strains are unrelated and likely independently inherited. We found no difference in Wolbachia infection frequency among host plant associated populations or between the asexual and sexual generations, or between males and females of the sexual generation. Partially incomplete Wolbachia transmission rates might explain the occurrence of uninfected individuals. A parallel analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene in B. treatae showed high mtDNA haplotype diversity in both infected and uninfected populations suggesting an ancestral infection by Wolbachia as well as a clear split between eastern and western B. treatae mtDNA clades with a sequence divergence of > 6%. The strain wTre1 was present almost exclusively in the western clade while wTre2 and wTre3 occur almost exclusively in eastern populations. In contrast, the same strains co-occur as double-infections in Georgia and triple-infections in two populations in central Florida. Conclusions: The diversity of Wolbachia across geographically and genetically distinct populations of B. treatae and the co-occurrence of the same strains within three populations highlights the complex infection dynamics in this system. Moreover, the association of distinct Wolbachia strains with mitochondrial haplotypes of its host in populations infected by different Wolbachia strains suggests a potential role of the endosymbiont in reproductive isolation in B. treatae.

**Wolbachia Multilocus Sequence Typing of Singly Infected and Multiply Infected Populations of Northern Corn Rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)**

Roehrdanz, RL; Wichmann, SS. 2014

The northern corn rootworm (Diabrotica barberi Smith & Lawrence) in eastern and central North America exhibits at least three distinct populations with respect to Wolbachia infection: uninfected; singly infected; multiply infected. The infected states are associated with different mtDNA haplotypes and reduced mtDNA variability. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to define strain types and examine the diversity of Wolbachia infecting northern corn rootworm. Four of the five MLST genes (coxA, hcpA, fbpA, and ftsZ) were represented by three alleles each. The remaining MLST gene (gatB) had four to six alleles. The uncertainty arose from whether to call two small clusters new alleles or artifacts of the amplification process. Singly infected individuals had a common set of alleles that defined one strain (wBarB). This strain was also a component of the multiple infections. A second strain (wBarA), restricted to the multiple infections, was defined by alleles that appeared with substantially greater frequency for each of the five loci. By default a third strain would comprise the less frequent third allele of the four loci, but it is not possible to determine to which gatB allele they are linked. Therefore, the strain is not fully defined. The diversity of gatB indicates that four to six Wolbachia strains are present in northern corn rootworm, a number that is similar to the five variants reported previously for the wsp gene. These results also highlight the very real difficulty of using the MLST system to define specific strains in a multiply infected host.

**Moderate Population Structure in Drosophila sturtevanti from the South American Atlantic Forest Biome**

Trava, BM; Mateus, RP; Machado, LPD; Madi-Ravazzi, L. NA

Drosophila sturtevanti is a widely distributed Neotropical species. In South America, it is abundant and adapted to different phytophysiognomies of the Atlantic Forest biome. Reproductive, chromosomal and enzymatic studies have indicated the existence of a differentiation among D. sturtevanti populations. In this work, the level of genetic diversity and the population genetic structure were analyzed using four population groupings. One hundred and twenty-six D. sturtevanti males collected from nine forest fragments were analyzed for 11 species-specific microsatellite loci. A total of 109 alleles, ranging from 2 to 16 alleles per locus, were detected. The highest mean observed heterozygosity H-O was estimated in samples from the largest collection areas, and the lowest H-O was from a population where fire events are common. A low molecular variation, around 3% among populations and negative among groups, an absence of genetic and geographic correlations and a moderate genetic differentiation F-ST = 0.0663 indicated that D. sturtevanti is not strongly structured. Besides no overall genetic and geographic distance correlation, the pair of closest geographically populations Matao and Nova Granada showed the lower differentiation through F-ST, DC and a Neighbor Joining tree. Ribeirao da Ilha RDI, an isolated insular population, was the most differentiated according to F-ST, DC and a cluster-based Bayesian analysis. The isolation of RDI that resulted in significant divergence could be ancient, because of sea level regressions/ transgressions, or more recently via founder effect/genetic drift by anthropic action carrying D. sturtevanti hosts from continent to island. This work is important for understanding the genetic variability distribution of a Neotropical forest-dwelling Drosophila species using for the first time, a wide population distribution approach.

**Racemic Pheromone Blends Disrupt Mate Location in the Invasive Swede Midge, Contarinia nasturtii**

Hodgdon, EA; Hallett, RH; Wallin, KF; Stratton, CA; Chen, YH. 2019

Swede midge, Contarinia nasturtii Kieffer, is an invasive cecidomyiid pest that causes serious losses of Brassica oilseed and vegetable crops in the Northeastern U.S. and Canada. Currently, few alternatives to systemic insecticides exist for its management. Because a single feeding larva can render heading Brassica crops unmarketable, management strategies that prevent oviposition are needed urgently. Pheromone-mediated mating disruption is a promising management approach for swede midge because it prevents mating and subsequent crop damage. While the swede midge pheromone has been identified, one of the major barriers to using it in mating disruption is the high cost of synthesis. Racemic blends, consisting of natural and non-natural stereoisomers, could be useful for mating disruption because they are cheaper to produce. However, it is not clear whether racemic pheromone blends attract males and/or prevent them from locating and mating with females. Here, we studied the behavior of male swede midge in Y-tube and wind tunnel bioassays to pheromone blends. Specifically, we tested whether males: (1) are attracted to different doses of pheromone, (2) discriminate between blends comprising natural stereospecific or racemic components, or a combination thereof, and (3) are able to locate and copulate with females in pheromone-permeated olfactometers. We found that picogram amounts of pheromone attracted males and prevented them from locating females in y-tube olfactometers. While males were more attracted to stereospecific blends, compared to racemic blends, all blends tested prevented nearly all males mating with females. Therefore, low dose racemic blends may be promising for pheromone-mediated mating disruption.

**The saga of mosquito evolution**

Rai, KS. 2011

In view of their importance as vectors, many mosquito genera and species in Dipteran family Culicidae have been the subjects of extensive cytological, genetic and evolutionary studies over the last more than 50 years. As a result, a great deal of information has accumulated on chromosome morphology and evolution, heterochromatin distribution and differentiation, and molecular structure, organization and evolution of genomes in this family. Numerically the haploid chromosome number (n = 3) has remained virtually unchanged. However extensive variation exists at different levels of genomic structure and organization. Anophelinae have heteromorphic sex chromosomes, a small genome size and repetitive elements are distributed in a long-period interspersion pattern. In contrast, Culicinae have homomorphic sex chromosomes and repetitive DNA is organized in a short-period interspersion pattern. There has been a general increase in genome size during the evolution of Culicine taxa. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes evolved early in the evolution of Anophelinae and a long-period interspersion pattern was retained. Intensive multi-point linkage map studies suggest that recombination frequencies per genome have remained relatively constant over the course of culicid evolution. As Anophelinae possesses relatively small genome size hence taxa in Anophelinae have a higher amount of recombination per haploid genome size than Culicinae. Undoubtedly, family Culicidae represents one of the best studied systems of genome evolution in animals. It is helpful to ascertain the mechanics of sympatric v/s allopatric speciation in closely related group of species.

**DNA barcode discovers two cryptic species and two geographical radiations in the invasive drosophilid Zaprionus indianus**

Yassin, A; Capy, P; Madi-Ravazzi, L; Ogereau, D; David, JR. 2008

Comparing introduced to ancestral populations within a phylogeographical context is crucial in any study aiming to understand the ecological genetics of an invasive species. Zaprionus indianus is a cosmopolitan drosophilid that has recently succeeded to expand its geographical range upon three continents (Africa, Asia and the Americas). We studied the distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes for two genes (CO-I and CO-II) among 23 geographical populations. mtDNA revealed the presence of two well-supported phylogenetic lineages (phylads), with bootstrap value of 100%. Phylad I included three African populations, reinforcing the African-origin hypothesis of the species. Within phylad II, a distinct phylogeographical pattern was discovered: Atlantic populations (from the Americas and Madeira) were closer to the ancestral African populations than to Eastern ones (from Madagascar, Middle East and India). This means that during its passage from endemism to cosmopolitanism, Z. indianus exhibited two independent radiations, the older (the Eastern) to the East, and the younger (the Atlantic) to the West. Discriminant function analysis using 13 morphometrical characters was also able to discriminate between the two molecular phylads (93.34 +/- 1.67%), although detailed morphological analysis of male genitalia using scanning electron microscopy showed no significant differences. Finally, crossing experiments revealed the presence of reproductive barrier between populations from the two phylads, and further between populations within phylad I. Hence, a bona species status was assigned to two new, cryptic species: Zaprionus africanus and Zaprionus gabonicus, and both were encompassed along with Z. indianus and Zaprionus megalorchis into the indianus complex. The ecology of these two species reveals that they are forest dwellers, which explains their restricted endemic distribution, in contrast to their relative cosmopolitan Z. indianus, known to be a human-commensal. Our results reconfirm the great utility of mtDNA at both inter- and intraspecific analyses within the frame of an integrated taxonomical project.

**Targeting male mosquito mating behaviour for malaria control**

Diabate, A; Tripet, F. 2015

Malaria vector control relies heavily on the use of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS). These, together with the combined drug administration efforts to control malaria, have reduced the death toll to less than 700,000 deaths/year. This progress has engendered real excitement but the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance is challenging our ability to sustain and consolidate the substantial gains that have been made. Research is required to discover novel vector control tools that can supplement and improve the effectiveness of those currently available. Here, we argue that recent and continuing progress in our understanding of male mating biology is instrumental in the implementation of new approaches based on the release of either conventional sterile or genetically engineered males. Importantly, further knowledge of male biology could also lead to the development of new interventions, such as sound traps and male mass killing in swarms, and contribute to new population sampling tools. We review and discuss recent advances in the behavioural ecology of male mating with an emphasis on the potential applications that can be derived from such knowledge. We also highlight those aspects of male mating ecology that urgently require additional study in the future.

**Genetic variability in Italian populations of Drosophila suzukii**

Tait, G; Vezzulli, S; Sassu, F; Antonini, G; Biondi, A; Baser, N; Sollai, G; Cini, A; Tonina, L; Ometto, L; Anfora, G. 2017

Background: Drosophila suzukii is a highly destructive pest species, causing substantial economic losses in soft fruit production. To better understand migration patterns, gene flow and adaptation in invaded regions, we studied the genetic structure of D. suzukii collected across Italy, where it was first observed in 2008. In particular, we analysed 15 previously characterised Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers to estimate genetic differentiation across the genome of 278 flies collected from nine populations. Results: The nine populations showed high allelic diversity, mainly due to very high heterozygosity. The high Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) index values (ranging from 0.68 to 0.84) indicated good discrimination power for the markers. Negative fixation index (F-IS) values in seven of the populations indicated a low level of inbreeding, as suggested by the high number of alleles. STRUCTURE, Principal Coordinate and Neighbour Joining analysis also revealed that the Sicilian population was fairly divergent compared to other Italian populations. Moreover, migration was present across all populations, with the exception of the Sicilian one, confirming its isolation relative to the mainland. Conclusions: This is the first study characterising the genetic structure of the invasive species D. suzukii in Italy. Our analysis showed extensive genetic homogeneity among D. suzukii collected in Italy. The relatively isolated Sicilian population suggests a largely human-mediated migration pattern, while the warm climate in this region allows the production of soft fruit, and the associated D. suzukii reproductive season occurring much earlier than on the rest of the peninsula.

**Host-associated genetic differentiation in phytophagous insects: General phenomenon or isolated exceptions? Evidence from a goldenrod-insect community**

Stireman, JO; Nason, JD; Heard, SB. 2005

There is growing awareness of the importance of natural selection in driving genetic divergence and speciation, and several of the most apparent cases of this ecological speciation are provided by the existence of genetically distinct host forms in phytophagous insects. Such examples of host-associated differentiation (HAD) have become increasingly documented, and the implications of this phenomenon for the diversification of insects are becoming widely appreciated. However, instances of HAD remain rare relative to insect diversity and are sparsely distributed both ecologically and taxonomically. We sought to assess the frequency of HAD in a model herbivore community by examining genetic divergence in a variety of herbivores that feed on two closely related and broadly sympatric species of goldenrod (Solidago altissima and S. gigantea). Using mitochondrial DNA and allozyme data, in conjunction with previously published studies, we found that four of nine herbivores exhibited evidence of HAD, including possible host races or cryptic species. Using a range of reasonable substitution rate estimates for cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial DNA, we found that HAD appears to have proceeded asynchronously across taxa. This pattern, along with the broadly sympatric distribution of host plants and the specialized life histories of the phytophagous insects, is consistent with sympatric divergence in some or all of these taxa. Although further behavioral and ecological study is needed, our survey of HAD in a community of herbivores indicates that ecological (perhaps sympatric) speciation may have been responsible for generating a significant fraction of the extant diversity of phytophagous insects.

**Host shifting and host sharing in a genus of specialist flies diversifying alongside their sunflower hosts**

Hippee, AC; Beer, MA; Bagley, RK; Condon, MA; Kitchen, A; Lisowski, EA; Norrbom, AL; Forbes, AA. 2021

Congeneric parasites are unlikely to specialize on the same tissues of the same host species, likely because of strong multifarious selection against niche overlap. Exceptions where >1 congeneric species use the same tissues reveal important insights into ecological factors underlying the origins and maintenance of diversity. Larvae of sunflower maggot flies in the genus Strauzia feed on plants in the family Asteraceae. Although Strauzia tend to be host specialists, some species specialize on the same hosts. To resolve the origins of host sharing among these specialist flies, we used reduced representation genomic sequencing to infer the first multilocus phylogeny of genus Strauzia. Our results show that Helianthus tuberosus and Helianthus grosseserratus each host three different Strauzia species and that the flies co-occurring on a host are not one another's closest relatives. Though this pattern implies that host sharing is most likely the result of host shifts, these may not all be host shifts in the conventional sense of an insect moving onto an entirely new plant. Many hosts of Strauzia belong to a clade of perennial sunflowers that arose 1-2 MYA and are noted for frequent introgression and **hybrid** speciation events. Our divergence time estimates for all of the Helianthus-associated Strauzia are within this same time window (<1 MYA), suggesting that rapid and recent adaptive introgression and speciation in Helianthus may have instigated the diversification of Strauzia, with some flies converging upon a single plant host after their respective ancestral host plants **hybrid**ized to form a new sunflower species.

**Problems with mitochondrial DNA as a marker in population, phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies: the effects of inherited symbionts**

Hurst, GDD; Jiggins, FM. 2005

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been a marker of choice for reconstructing historical patterns of population demography, admixture, biogeography and speciation. However, it has recently been suggested that the pervasive nature of direct and indirect selection on this molecule renders any conclusion derived from it ambiguous. We review here the evidence for indirect selection on mtDNA in arthropods arising from linkage disequilibrium with maternally inherited symbionts. We note first that these symbionts are very common in arthropods and then review studies that reveal the extent to which they shape mtDNA evolution. mtDNA diversity patterns are compatible with neutral expectations for an uninfected population in only 2 of 19 cases. The remaining 17 studies revealed cases of symbiont-driven reduction in mtDNA diversity, symbiont-driven increases in diversity, symbiont-driven changes in mtDNA variation over space and symbiont-associated paraphyly of mtDNA. We therefore conclude that these elements often confound the inference of an organism's evolutionary history from mtDNA data and that mtDNA on its own is an unsuitable marker for the study of recent historical events in arthropods. We also discuss the impact of these studies on the current programme of taxonomy based on DNA bar-coding.

**Limited genomic divergence between intraspecific forms of Culex pipiens under different ecological pressures**

Gomes, B; Wilding, CS; Weetman, D; Sousa, CA; Novo, MT; Savage, HM; Almeida, APG; Pinto, J; Donnelly, MJ. 2015

Background: Divergent selection can be a major driver of ecological speciation. In insects of medical importance, understanding the speciation process is both of academic interest and public health importance. In the West Nile virus vector Culex pipiens, intraspecific pipiens and molestus forms vary in ecological and physiological traits. Populations of each form appear to share recent common ancestry but patterns of genetic differentiation across the genome remain unknown. Here, we undertook an AFLP genome scan on samples collected from both sympatric and allopatric populations from Europe and the USA to quantify the extent of genomic differentiation between the two forms. Results: The forms were clearly differentiated but each exhibited major population sub-structuring between continents. Divergence between pipiens and molestus forms from USA was higher than in both inter- and intra-continental comparisons with European samples. The proportion of outlier loci between pipiens and molestus (approximate to 3 %) was low but consistent in both continents, and similar to those observed between sibling species of other mosquito species which exhibit contemporary gene flow. Only two of the outlier loci were shared between inter-form comparisons made within Europe and USA. Conclusion: This study supports the molestus and pipiens status as distinct evolutionary entities with low genomic divergence. The low number of shared divergent loci between continents suggests a relatively limited number of genomic regions determining key typological traits likely to be driving incipient speciation and/or adaptation of molestus to anthropogenic habitats.

**Phylogenetic Patterns of Geographical and Ecological Diversification in the Subgenus Drosophila**

Morales-Hojas, R; Vieira, J. 2012

Colonisation of new geographic regions and/or of new ecological resources can result in rapid species diversification into the new ecological niches available. Members of the subgenus Drosophila are distributed across the globe and show a large diversity of ecological niches. Furthermore, taxonomic classification of Drosophila includes the rank radiation, which refers to closely related species groups. Nevertheless, it has never been tested if these taxonomic radiations correspond to evolutionary radiations. Here we present a study of the patterns of diversification of Drosophila to test for increased diversification rates in relation to the geographic and ecological diversification processes. For this, we have estimated and dated a phylogeny of 218 species belonging to the major species groups of the subgenus. The obtained phylogenies are largely consistent with previous studies and indicate that the major groups appeared during the Oligocene/Miocene transition or early Miocene, characterized by a trend of climate warming with brief periods of glaciation. Ancestral reconstruction of geographic ranges and ecological resource use suggest at least two dispersals to the Neotropics from the ancestral Asiatic tropical disribution, and several transitions to specialized ecological resource use (mycophagous and cactophilic). Colonisation of new geographic regions and/or of new ecological resources can result in rapid species diversification into the new ecological niches available. However, diversification analyses show no significant support for adaptive radiations as a result of geographic dispersal or ecological resource shift. Also, cactophily has not resulted in an increase in the diversification rate of the repleta and related groups. It is thus concluded that the taxonomic radiations do not correspond to adaptive radiations.

**Evolution of oviposition strategies and speciation in the globeflower flies Chiastocheta spp. (Anthomyiidae)**

Despres, L; Jaeger, N. 1999

Trollius europaeus (Ranunculaceae) is involved in an intimate interaction with several species of Chiastocheta flies (Anthamyiidae) that are both seed predators and pollinators. In this paper, we analyse the oviposition strategy of the six Chiastocheta species found to coexist on T. europaeus in 19 populations from the French Alps. We shaw that the species are not equivalent in their oviposition behaviour:, C. rotundiventris usually deposits no more:than one egg per flower in first-day flowers whereas C. dentifera aggregates ifs eggs on fruits and thus does not contribute to pollination at all; the four remaining species deposit eggs sequentially during the flowering period from the 2nd to the :7th day. Hence, the outcomes of the interaction in terms of net Seed production for the plant greatly depend on the Chiastocheta species visiting it,ranging from a mutualistic to a purely-parasitic interaction. We assessed mitochondrial divergence between Chiastocheta spp: by sequencing a 1320-bp mitochondrial DNA fragment. The low divergence observed between species (0-4-15%) suggests that genus diversification took place recently. Unlike in other plant-insect systems where diversification is usually thought to be driven by cospeciation or host shifts we propose that Chiastocheta speciation took place within the host plant. Basal separation of a particularly mutualistic species provided favourable conditions far plant specialization on this seed-parasite as: a pollinator early in the evolution of the association. The parasitic species ovipositing on fruits derived from a species ovipositing on flowers. Diversification of the intermediate strategies probably occurred in relation with the Pleistocene climatic events, reproductive isolation between species being reinforced by niche partitioning for oviposition and/or sexual selection.

**Characterisation of Species and Diversity of Anopheles gambiae Keele Colony**

Ranford-Cartwright, LC; McGeechan, S; Inch, D; Smart, G; Richterova, L; Mwangi, JM. 2016

Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto was recently reclassified as two species, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s., in wild-caught mosquitoes, on the basis of the molecular form, denoted M or S, of a marker on the X chromosome. The An. gambiae Keele line is an outbred laboratory colony strain that was developed around 12 years ago by crosses between mosquitoes from 4 existing An. gambiae colonies. Laboratory colonies of mosquitoes often have limited genetic diversity because of small starting populations (founder effect) and subsequent fluctuations in colony size. Here we describe the characterisation of the chromosomal form(s) present in the Keele line, and investigate the diversity present in the colony using microsatellite markers on chromosome 3. We also characterise the large 2La inversion on chromosome 2. The results indicate that only the M-form of the chromosome X marker is present in the Keele colony, which was unexpected given that 3 of the 4 parent colonies were probably S-form. Levels of diversity were relatively high, as indicated by a mean number of microsatellite alleles of 6.25 across 4 microsatellites, in at least 25 mosquitoes. Both karyotypes of the inversion on chromosome 2 (2La/2L+(a)) were found to be present at approximately equal proportions. The Keele colony has a mixed M-and S-form origin, and in common with the PEST strain, we propose continuing to denote it as an An. gambiae s. s. line.

**Strategy for enhanced transgenic strain development for embryonic conditional lethality in Anastrepha suspensa**

Schetelig, MF; Handler, AM. 2012

Here the first reproductive sterility system for the tephritid fruit fly pest, Anastrepha suspensa, is presented, based on lethality primarily limited to embryos heterozygous for a conditional lethal transgene combination. This tetracycline (Tet)-suppressible system uses a driver construct having the promoter from the newly isolated embryo-specific A. suspensa serendipity alpha gene linked to the Tet-transactivator. This was used to drive expression of a phosphomutated variant of the pro-apoptotic cell death gene, hid, from A. ludens, that was isolated, based on its identity to A. suspensa hid. The Alhid(Ala2) variant was shown to have the highest cell death activity in an in vitro A. suspensa cell death assay compared to the orthologous genes Ashid, Dmhid, and the variant Dmhid(Ala5). These cell death assays also allowed a determination of the most-efficient driver-effector cassette combinations for use in A. suspensa transformants, resulting in two **hybrid** strains exhibiting 100% lethality. One strain was 96% lethal in embryos in the absence of tetracycline, with none surviving past the first larval instar, which is critical for pests that are most damaging in late-larval stages. We demonstrate that the isolation and in vitro validation of species-specific promoters and lethal effector genes can greatly improve the efficiency of creating high-performance conditional lethality strains that may be extended to other insect pest species.

**Speciation by host-switching in pinyon Cinara (Insecta : Hemiptera : Aphididae)**

Favret, C; Voegtlin, DJ. 2004

Parasite-host cospeciation has received much attention as an important mechanism in the diversification of phytophagous insects. However, studies have shown that for certain taxa, it is not host fidelity but host-switching that plays the critical role in speciation. Cinara are aphids (Insecta: Hemiptera: Aphididae: Lachninae) that feed exclusively on the woody parts of conifers of the Cupressaceae and Pinaceae. They are unusual aphids because most Pinaceae play host to several species of Cinara. The aphids show relatively strong host fidelity, and as a consequence historically have been treated based on the taxonomy of their hosts. The historical paradigm of aphid evolution implies that Cinara species have radiated to different parts of the same host species and/or speciated with their host. Using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and nuclear elongation factor 1-alpha DNA sequences, we performed molecular phylogenctic analysis of Cinara species, concentrating on those associated with pinyon pines in the southwestern USA. We determined that switching hosts has played a key role in the speciation of the genus, reflected in the polyphyly of pinyon-feeding Cinara. Furthermore, species sharing a common feeding site on different hosts were more closely related to each other than to those sharing the same host but at different feeding sites, suggesting that feeding site fidelity plays a more important role in speciation than does host fidelity in general. This study also elucidated the primary taxonomy of various species: it suggested that Cinara rustica Hottes is a junior synonym of C edulis (Wilson) and that C wahtolca Hottes represents two species on the two different pinyon pine species, Pinus edulis Englem. and P. monophylla Torr.

**Host Plant Adaptation in Cactophilic Species of the Drosophila buzzatii Cluster: Fitness and Transcriptomics**

Hasson, E; De Panis, D; Hurtado, J; Mensch, J. 2019

Host plant shifts in herbivorous insects often involve facing new environments that may speed up the evolution of oviposition behavior, performance-related traits, morphology, and, incidentally, reproductive isolation. In the genus Drosophila, cactophilic species of the repleta group include emblematic species in the study of the evolution of host plant utilization. The South American D. buzzatii and its sibling D. koepferae are a model system for the study of differential host plant use. Although these species exhibit a certain degree of niche overlap, the former breeds primarily on decaying cladodes of Opuntia cacti while D. koepferae main hosts are columnar cacti of the genus Trichocereus. Opuntia sulphurea and Trichocereus terscheckii are among the main hosts in nature. These cacti differ in ecological (spatial and temporal predictability) and chemical characteristics. Particularly relevant is the presence of toxic alkaloids in T. terscheckii. Studies of the effects of these cacti and alkaloids revealed the remarkable impact on oviposition behavior, viability, developmental time, wing morphology, mating success, and developmental stability in both species. Recent whole-genome expression studies showed that expression profiles are massively affected by the rearing cactus, and that the presence of alkaloids is the main factor modulating gene expression in D. buzzatii. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes are related to detoxification processes and stress response-though genes involved in development are an important part of the transcriptomic response. The implications of our studies in the evolution of host plant use in the repleta group are discussed.

**The Importance of Acoustic Signals in Multimodal Courtship Behavior in Drosophila virilis, D. lummei and D. littoralis**

Belkina, EG; Lazebny, OE; Vedenina, VY. 2021

The courtship rituals of Drosophila include an exchange of several signals with different modalities, chemical, visual, acoustic and tactile stimuli, between sexes. Using a video recording method, we studied the role of acoustic communication in courtship behavior in three species of the Drosophila virilis group, D. virilis, D. lummei and two populations of D. littoralis. Five series of experiments were performed: tests with intact flies (control), tests with mute flies (wingless males or females), and tests with deaf flies (aristaless males or females). We distinguished the two situations: either a female did not hear a male or vice versa, males did not hear females. When females did not hear males, the reduction in the copulation number was found in D. virilis and both populations of D. littoralis, but not in D. lummei. When males did not hear females, the reduction in the copulation number was only found in D. littoralis. The ablation of the male aristae in D. virilis and D. lummei even increased the mating success as compared to the control, which may be explained by the 'sensory overload' hypothesis. The changes in courtship temporal structure usually included the delayed onset of the main courtship elements (tapping, licking, and singing), and the variation in their duration and the total time of courtship. These effects were, however, more substantial in D. virilis and both populations of D. littoralis than in D. lummei. Thus, the effect of blocking the acoustic channel was different in the three species regardless of their phylogenetic relationship, and the role of acoustic communication in courtship behavior seemed to increase in the order D. lummei - D. virilis - D. littoralis.

**Host races in plant-feeding insects and their importance in sympatric speciation**

Dres, M; Mallet, J. 2002

The existence of a continuous array of sympatric biotypes-from polymorphisms, through ecological or host races with increasing reproductive isolation, to good species-can provide strong evidence for a continuous route to sympatric speciation via natural selection. Host races in plant-feeding insects, in particular, have often been used as evidence for the probability of sympatric speciation. Here, we provide verifiable criteria to distinguish host races from other biotypes: in brief, host races are genetically differentiated, sympatric populations of parasites that use different hosts and between which there is appreciable gene flow. We recognize host races as kinds of species that regularly exchange genes with other species at a rate of more than ca. 1% per generation, rather than as fundamentally distinct taxa. Host races provide a convenient, although admittedly somewhat arbitrary intermediate stage along the speciation continuum. They are a heuristic device to aid in evaluating the probability of speciation by natural selection, particularly in sympatry. Speciation is thereby envisaged as having two phases: (i) the evolution of host races from within polymorphic, panmictic populations; and (ii) further reduction of gene flow between host races until the diverging populations can become generally accepted as species. We apply this criterion to 21 putative host race systems. Of these, only three are unambiguously classified as host races, but a further eight are strong candidates that merely lack accurate information on rates of **hybrid**ization or gene flow. Thus, over one-half of the cases that we review are probably or certainly host races, under our definition. Our review of the data favours the idea of sympatric speciation via host shift for three major reasons: (i) the evolution of assortative mating as a pleiotropic by-product of adaptation to a new host seems likely, even in cases where mating occurs away from the host; (ii) stable genetic differences in half of the cases attest to the power of natural selection to maintain multilocus polymorphisms with substantial linkage disequilibrium, in spite of probable gene flow; and (iii) this linkage disequilibrium should permit additional host adaptation, leading to further reproductive isolation via pleiotropy, and also provides conditions suitable for adaptive evolution of mate choice (reinforcement) to cause still further reductions in gene flow. Current data are too sparse to rule out a cryptic discontinuity in the apparently stable sympatric route from host-associated polymorphism to host-associated species, but such a hiatus seems unlikely on present evidence. Finally, we discuss applications of an understanding of host races in conservation and in managing adaptation by pests to control strategies, including those involving biological control or transgenic parasite-resistant plants.

**Medfly-Wolbachia symbiosis: genotype x genotype interactions determine host's life history traits under mass rearing conditions**

Kyritsis, GA; Augustinos, AA; Livadaras, I; Caceres, C; Bourtzis, K; Papadopoulos, NT. 2019

BackgroundWolbachia pipientis is a widespread, obligatory intracellular and maternally inherited bacterium, that induces a wide range of reproductive alterations to its hosts. Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) is causing embryonic lethality, the most common of them. Despite that Wolbachia-borne sterility has been proposed as an environmental friendly pest control method (Incompatible Insect Technique, IIT) since 1970s, the fact that Wolbachia modifies important fitness components of its hosts sets severe barriers to IIT implementation. Mass rearing of Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (medfly), is highly optimized given that this pest is a model species regarding the implementation of another sterility based pest control method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We used the medfly-Wolbachia symbiotic association, as a model system, to study the effect of two different Wolbachia strains, on the life history traits of 2 C. capitata lines with different genomic background.ResultsWolbachia effects are regulated by both C. capitata genetic background and the Wolbachia strain. Wolbachia infection reduces fertility rates in both C. capitata genetic backgrounds and shortens the pre-pupa developmental duration in the GSS strain. On the other hand, regardless of the strain of Wolbachia (wCer2, wCer4) infection does not affect either the sex ratio or the longevity of adults. wCer4 infection imposed a reduction in females' fecundity but wCer2 did not. Male mating competitiveness, adults flight ability and longevity under water and food deprivation were affected by both the genetic background of medfly and the strain of Wolbachia (genotype by genotype interaction).ConclusionWolbachia infection could alter important life history traits of mass-reared C. capitata lines and therefore the response of each genotype on the Wolbachia infection should be considered toward ensuring the productivity of the Wolbachia-infected insects under mass-rearing conditions.

**FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON IN VITRO HYBRIDIZATION OF HEMOSPORIDIAN PARASITES: PATTERNS OF OOKINETE DEVELOPMENT IN HAEMOPROTEUS SPP.**

Valkiunas, G; Palinauskas, V; Krizanauskiene, A; Bernotiene, R; Kazlauskiene, R; Iezhova, TA. 2013

Increasingly frequent outbreaks of zoonotic infections call for studies of wildlife parasites to reach a better understanding of the mechanisms of host switch, leading to the evolution of new diseases. However, speciation processes have been insufficiently addressed in experimental parasitology studies, primarily due to difficulties in determining and measuring mate-recognition signals in parasites. We investigated patterns of sexual process and ookinete development in avian Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) spp. (Haemosporida, Haemoproteidae) using in vitro experiments on between-lineage **hybrid**ization. Eleven mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) lineages belonging to 9 species of hemoproteid were isolated from naturally infected passerine birds. The parasites were identified to species on the basis of morphology of their gametocytes and polymerase chain reaction amplification of segments of the cyt b gene. Sexual process and ookinete development were initiated in vitro by mixing blood containing mature gametocytes with a 3.7% solution of sodium citrate and exposing the mixture to air. Ookinetes of all lineages except Haemoproteus payevskyi (lineage hRW1) and Haemoproteus nucleocondensus (hGRW1) developed; the 2 latter species did not exflagellate. Between-lineage **hybrid**ization was initiated by mixing blood containing mature gametocytes of 2 different parasites; the following experiments were performed: (1) Haemoproteus pallidus (lineage hPFC1) x Haemoproteus minutus (lineage hTURDUS2); (2) H. pallidus (hPFC1) x Haemoproteus tartakovskyi (hSISKIN1); (3) Haemoproteus belopolskyi (hHIICT3) x Haemoproteus lanii (hRB1); (4) Haemoproteus balmorali (hSFC1) x H. pallidus (hPFC1); (5) H. belopolskyi (hHIICT1) x Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi (hSYBOR1); (6) H. tartakovskyi (hHAWF1) x H. tartakovskyi (hSISKIN1); (7) H. pallidus (hPFC1) x H. lanii (hRB1); (8) H. tartakovskyi (hHAWF1) x H. parabelopolskyi (hSYBOR1). We report 4 patterns of between-lineage interactions that seem to be common and might prevent mixing lineages during simultaneous sexual process in wildlife: (1) the blockage of ookinete development of both parasites; (2) the development of ookinetes of 1 parasite and blockage of ookinete development of the other; (3) selective within-lineage mating resulting in ookinete development of both parent species and absence of **hybrid** organisms; (4) absence of selective within-lineage mating resulting in presence of ookinetes of both parents and also development of **hybrid** organisms with unclear potential for further sporogony. The present study indicates directions for collection of source material in the investigation of mechanisms of reproductive isolation leading to speciation in these parasites. The next steps in these studies should be the development of nuclear markers for distinguishing hemosporidian **hybrid** organisms and the experimental observation of further development of **hybrid** ookinetes in vectors.

**Mitochondrial genome sequences reveal deep divergences among Anopheles punctulatus sibling species in Papua New Guinea**

Logue, K; Chan, ER; Phipps, T; Small, ST; Reimer, L; Henry-Halldin, C; Sattabongkot, J; Siba, PM; Zimmerman, PA; Serre, D. 2013

Background: Members of the Anopheles punctulatus group (AP group) are the primary vectors of human malaria in Papua New Guinea. The AP group includes 13 sibling species, most of them morphologically indistinguishable. Understanding why only certain species are able to transmit malaria requires a better comprehension of their evolutionary history. In particular, understanding relationships and divergence times among Anopheles species may enable assessing how malaria-related traits (e.g. blood feeding behaviours, vector competence) have evolved. Methods: DNA sequences of 14 mitochondrial (mt) genomes from five AP sibling species and two species of the Anopheles dirus complex of Southeast Asia were sequenced. DNA sequences from all concatenated protein coding genes (10,770 bp) were then analysed using a Bayesian approach to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and date the divergence of the AP sibling species. Results: Phylogenetic reconstruction using the concatenated DNA sequence of all mitochondrial protein coding genes indicates that the ancestors of the AP group arrived in Papua New Guinea 25 to 54 million years ago and rapidly diverged to form the current sibling species. Conclusion: Through evaluation of newly described mt genome sequences, this study has revealed a divergence among members of the AP group in Papua New Guinea that would significantly predate the arrival of humans in this region, 50 thousand years ago. The divergence observed among the mtDNA sequences studied here may have resulted from reproductive isolation during historical changes in sea-level through glacial minima and maxima. This leads to a hypothesis that the AP sibling species have evolved independently for potentially thousands of generations. This suggests that the evolution of many phenotypes, such as insecticide resistance will arise independently in each of the AP sibling species studied here.

**The Population Structure of Glossina palpalis gambiensis from Island and Continental Locations in Coastal Guinea**

Solano, P; Ravel, S; Bouyer, J; Camara, M; Kagbadouno, MS; Dyer, N; Gardes, L; Herault, D; Donnelly, MJ; De Meeus, T. 2009

Background: We undertook a population genetics analysis of the tsetse fly Glossina palpalis gambiensis, a major vector of sleeping sickness in West Africa, using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers. Our aims were to estimate effective population size and the degree of isolation between coastal sites on the mainland of Guinea and Loos Islands. The sampling locations encompassed Dubreka, the area with the highest Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) prevalence in West Africa, mangrove and savannah sites on the mainland, and two islands, Fotoba and Kassa, within the Loos archipelago. These data are discussed with respect to the feasibility and sustainability of control strategies in those sites currently experiencing, or at risk of, sleeping sickness. Principal Findings: We found very low migration rates between sites except between those sampled around the Dubreka area that seems to contain a widely dispersed and panmictic population. In the Kassa island samples, various effective population size estimates all converged on surprisingly small values (10, Ne, 30) that suggest either a recent bottleneck, and/or other biological or ecological factors such as strong variance in the reproductive success of individuals. Conclusion/Significance: Whatever their origin, the small effective population sizes suggest high levels of inbreeding in tsetse flies within the island samples in marked contrast to the large diffuse deme in Dubreka zones. We discuss how these genetic results suggest that different tsetse control strategies should be applied on the mainland and islands.

**Flowers, phenology and pollination of the endemic New Zealand greenhood orchid Pterostylis brumalis**

Bodley, EJ; Beggs, JR; Toft, R; Gaskett, AC. 2016

Greenhood orchids are most diverse in New Zealand and Australia, with at least some species pollinated by sexual deception of male fungus gnats. Preliminary investigation of endemic New Zealand Pterostylis brumalis via field phenology, hand-pollination and insect trapping revealed P. brumalis is self-compatible but relies on insects for cross pollination. Natural fruit-set was low, averaging 2.6% across two populations. High fruit-set in hand-pollinated flowers (66.7%) indicates severe pollinator limitation. In comparison, only one collected insect, a female Mycetophila vulgaris, bore orchid pollinia. Potential pollinator attractants (colour and scent) were analysed. UV reflectance may enhance pollinator detection of the flower against the background, but visual modelling generated conflicting results: a categorical fly vision model indicated excellent camouflage against herbivory, but a generic tetrachromat vision model suggested flowers are easily distinguishable against the background. Both models have flaws that create issues with drawing conclusions, and identification of the pollinator is required to understand their visual system further. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed putative scent-releasing osmophores (lateral sepals) and uniform papillate trichomes (labellum) that may mechanically direct pollinators into the floral trap. The trap is a pressure sensitive labellum that temporarily traps the visitor inside the flower.

**Microbial control of malaria: Biological warfare against the parasite and its vector**

Abdul-Ghani, R; Al-Mekhlafi, AM; Alabsi, MS. 2012

Microbial applications in malaria transmission control have drawn global attention. Mosquito midgut microbiota can modulate vector immunity and block Plasmodium development. Paratransgenic manipulation of bacterial symbionts and Wolbachia can affect reproductive characteristics of mosquitoes. Bacillus-based biolarvicides can control mosquito larvae in different breeding habitats, but their effectiveness differs according to the type of formulation applied, and the physical and ecological conditions of the environment. Entomopathogenic fungi show promise as effective and evolution-proof agents against adult mosquitoes. In addition, transgenic fungi can express anti-plasmodial effector molecules that can target the parasite inside its vector. Despite showing effectiveness in domestic environments as well as against insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, claims towards their deployability in the field and their possible use in integrated vector management programmes have yet to be investigated. Viral pathogens show efficacy in the interruption of sporogonic development of the parasite, and protozoal pathogens exert direct pathogenic potential on larvae and adults with substantial effects on mosquito longevity and fecundity. However, the technology required for their isolation and maintenance impedes their field application. Many agents show promising findings: however, the question remains about the epidemiologic reality of these approaches because even those that have been tried under field conditions still have certain limitations. This review addresses aspects of the microbial control of malaria between proof-of-concept and epidemiologic reality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

**Contemporary gene flow between wild An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis**

Weetman, D; Steen, K; Rippon, EJ; Mawejje, HD; Donnelly, MJ; Wilding, CS. NA

Background: In areas where the morphologically indistinguishable malaria mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae Giles and An. arabiensis Patton are sympatric, **hybrid**s are detected occasionally via species-diagnostic molecular assays. An. gambiae and An. arabiensis exhibit both pre- and post-reproductive mating barriers, with swarms largely species-specific and male F1 (first-generation) **hybrid**s sterile. Consequently advanced-stage **hybrid**s (back-crosses to parental species), which would represent a route for potentially-adaptive introgression, are expected to be very rare in natural populations. Yet the use of one or two physically linked single-locus diagnostic assays renders them indistinguishable from F1 **hybrid**s and levels of interspecific gene flow are unknown. Methods: We used data from over 350 polymorphic autosomal SNPs to investigate post F1 gene flow via patterns of genomic admixture between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis from eastern Uganda. Simulations were used to investigate the statistical power to detect **hybrid**s with different levels of crossing and to identify the **hybrid** category significantly admixed genotypes could represent. Results: A range of admixture proportions were detected for 11 field-collected **hybrid**s identified via single-locus species-diagnostic PCRs. Comparison of admixture data with simulations indicated that at least seven of these **hybrid**s were advanced generation crosses, with backcrosses to each species identified. In addition, of 36 individuals typing as An. gambiae or An. arabiensis that exhibited outlying admixture proportions, ten were identified as significantly mixed backcrosses, and at least four of these were second or third generation crosses. Conclusions: Our results show that **hybrid**s detected using standard diagnostics will often be **hybrid** generations beyond F1, and that in our study area around 5% (95% confidence intervals 3%-9%) of apparently 'pure' species samples may also be backcrosses. This is likely an underestimate because of rapidly-declining detection power beyond the first two backcross generations. Post-F1 gene flow occurs at a far from inconsequential rate between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, and, especially for traits under strong selection, could readily lead to adaptive introgression of genetic variants relevant for vector control.

**Enemy-free space promotes maintenance of host races in an aphid species**

Vosteen, I; Gershenzon, J; Kunert, G. 2016

The enormous biodiversity of herbivorous insects may arise from ecological speciation via continuous host-plant switches. Whether such switches are successful depends on the trade-off between different selection pressures that act on herbivores. Decreased herbivore performance due to suboptimal nutrition might be compensated for by a reduced natural enemy pressure. As a consequence, an "enemy-free space" on a certain plant might facilitate host-plant switches and maintain biotypes. To test this hypothesis, we used the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) complex, which consists of at least 11 genetically distinct host races that are native to specific legume host plants but can all develop on the universal host plant Vicia faba. Three A. pisum host races native to Trifolium pratense, Pisum sativum, and Medicago sativa were investigated in experiments on their respective host plants and on the universal host plant V. faba. We found that hoverflies preferred to oviposit on P. sativum and the universal host V. faba. Since feeding by hoverfly larvae suppressed aphid population growth on these host plants, the native hosts M. sativa and T. pratense provided enemy-free space for the respective A. pisum races. Mobile predators, such as ants and ladybird beetles, preferred Pisum race aphids on V. faba over P. sativum. Thus, all three of the native host plants studied supply enemy-free space for A. pisum compared to the universal host V. faba. Reducing encounters between aphid races on V. faba would reduce gene flow among them and could contribute to maintaining the host races.

**Cryptic Diversity within the Major Trypanosomiasis Vector Glossina fuscipes Revealed by Molecular Markers**

Dyer, NA; Ravel, S; Choi, KS; Darby, AC; Causse, S; Kapitano, B; Hall, MJR; Steen, K; Lutumba, P; Madinga, J; Torr, SJ; Okedi, LM; Lehane, MJ; Donnelly, MJ. 2011

Background: The tsetse fly Glossina fuscipes s.l. is responsible for the transmission of approximately 90% of cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness. Three G. fuscipes subspecies have been described, primarily based upon subtle differences in the morphology of their genitalia. Here we describe a study conducted across the range of this important vector to determine whether molecular evidence generated from nuclear DNA (microsatellites and gene sequence information), mitochondrial DNA and symbiont DNA support the existence of these taxa as discrete taxonomic units. Principal Findings: The nuclear ribosomal Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) provided support for the three subspecies. However nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data did not support the monophyly of the morphological subspecies G. f. fuscipes or G. f. quanzensis. Instead, the most strongly supported monophyletic group was comprised of flies sampled from Ethiopia. Maternally inherited loci (mtDNA and symbiont) also suggested monophyly of a group from Lake Victoria basin and Tanzania, but this group was not supported by nuclear loci, suggesting different histories of these markers. Microsatellite data confirmed strong structuring across the range of G. fuscipes s.l., and was useful for deriving the interrelationship of closely related populations. Conclusion/Significance: We propose that the morphological classification alone is not used to classify populations of G. fuscipes for control purposes. The Ethiopian population, which is scheduled to be the target of a sterile insect release (SIT) programme, was notably discrete. From a programmatic perspective this may be both positive, given that it may reflect limited migration into the area or negative if the high levels of differentiation are also reflected in reproductive isolation between this population and the flies to be used in the release programme.

**DNA barcoding: species delimitation in tree peonies**

Zhang, JM; Wang, JX; Xia, T; Zhou, SL. 2009

Delimitations of species are crucial for correct and precise identification of taxa. Unfortunately "species" is more a subjective than an objective concept in taxonomic practice due to difficulties in revealing patterns of infra- or inter-specific variations. Molecular phylogenetic studies at the population level solve this problem and lay a sound foundation for DNA barcoding. In this paper we exemplify the necessity of adopting a phylogenetic concept of species in DNA barcoding for tree peonies (Paeonia sect. Moutan). We used 40 samples representing all known populations of rare and endangered species and several populations of widely distributed tree peonies. All currently recognized species and major variants have been included in this study. Four chloroplast gene fragments, i.e. ndhF, rps16-trnQ, trnL-F and trnS-G (a total of 5040 characters, 96 variable and 69 parsimony-informative characters) and one variable and single-copy nuclear GPAT gene fragment (2093-2197 bp, 279 variable and 148 parsimony-informative characters) were used to construct phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. The evolutionary lineages revealed by the nuclear gene and the chloroplast genes are inconsistent with the current circumscriptions of P. decomposita, P. jishanensis, P. qiui, and P. rockii based on morphology. The inconsistencies come from (1) significant chloroplast gene divergence but little nuclear GPAT gene divergence among population systems of P. decomposita + P. rockii, and (2) well-diverged nuclear GPAT gene but little chloroplast gene divergence between P. jishanensis and P. qiui. The incongruence of the phylogenies based on the chloroplast genes and the nuclear GPAT gene is probably due to the chloroplast capture event in evolutionary history, as no reproductive barriers exist to prevent inter-specific **hybrid**ization. We also evaluated the suitability of these genes for use as DNA barcodes for tree peonies. The variability of chloroplast genes among well-defined species or population systems of a species complex is 4.82 times the figure within the groups, and the GPAT gene is twice as variable between the groups as within the groups. The number of completely divergent sites is sufficient to mark the two subsections, the two species in subsection Delavayanae, and the well-divergent species in subsection Vaginatae. But the genes currently used either from the chloroplast genome or from the nuclear genome alone cannot correctly assign samples of P. decomposita, P. jishanensis, P. qiui, or P. rockii to the species as currently defined. We conclude that (1) DNA barcoding should be based on prior phylogenetic studies to understand the evolutionary lineages and how well the taxonomic species correspond to the lineages; (2) it is unlikely to find a single short fragment as a barcode for every plant and such a fragment could result in misidentification when a chloroplast capture event happened in the evolutionary history of plants like tree peonies; and (3) we suggest striving for a universal marker at the familial level and locally universal barcodes within a family instead of looking for a universal barcode for all plants.

**Cross-Mating Compatibility and Competitiveness among Aedes albopictus Strains from Distinct Geographic Origins Implications for Future Application of SIT Programs in the South West Indian Ocean Islands**

Damiens, D; Lebon, C; Wilkinson, DA; Dijoux-Millet, D; Le Goff, G; Bheecarry, A; Gouagna, LC. 2016

The production of large numbers of males needed for a sustainable sterile insect technique (SIT) control program requires significant developmental and operational costs. This may constitute a significant economic barrier to the installation of large scale rearing facilities in countries that are undergoing a transition from being largely dependent on insecticide use to be in a position to integrate the SIT against Aedes albopictus. Alternative options available for those countries could be to rely on outsourcing of sterile males from a foreign supplier, or for one centralised facility to produce mosquitoes for several countries, thus increasing the efficiency of the mass-rearing effort. However, demonstration of strain compatibility is a prerequisite for the export of mosquitoes for transborder SIT applications. Here, we compared mating compatibility among Ae. albopictus populations originating from three islands of the South Western Indian Ocean, and assessed both insemination rates and egg fertility in all possible cross-mating combinations. Furthermore, competitiveness between irradiated and non-irradiated males from the three studied strains, and the subsequent effect on female fertility were also examined. Although morphometric analysis of wing shapes suggested phenoptypic differences between Ae. albopictus strains, perfect reproductive compatibility between them was observed. Furthermore, irradiated males from the different islands demonstrated similar levels of competitiveness and induced sterility when confronted with fertile males from any of the other island populations tested. In conclusion, despite the evidence of inter-strain differences based on male wing morphology, collectively, our results provide a new set of expectations for the use of a single candidate strain of mass-reared sterile males for area-wide scale application of SIT against Ae. albopictus populations in different islands across the South Western Indian Ocean. Cross-mating competitiveness tests such as those applied here are necessary to assess the quality of mass reared strains for the trans-border application of sterile male release programs.

**Separating two tightly linked species-defining phenotypes in Bactrocera with hybrid recombinant analysis**

Yeap, HL; Lee, SF; Robinson, F; Mourant, RG; Sved, JA; Frommer, M; Papanicolaou, A; Edwards, OR; Oakeshott, JG. 2020

BackgroundBactrocera tryoni and Bactrocera neohumeralis mate asynchronously; the former mates exclusively around dusk while the latter mates during the day. The two species also differ in the colour of the post-pronotal lobe (callus), which is predominantly yellow in B. tryoni and brown in B. neohumeralis. We have examined the genetic relationship between the two characters in **hybrid**s, backcrosses and multigeneration **hybrid** progeny.ResultsOur analysis of the mating time of the parental species revealed that while B. tryoni mate exclusively at dusk, B. neohumeralis females pair with B. neohumeralis males during the day and with B. tryoni males at dusk. We found considerable variance in mating time and callus colour among **hybrid** backcross individuals of both sexes but there was a strong although not invariant trend for callus colour to co-segregate with mating time in both sexes. To genetically separate these two phenotypes we allowed the interspecific F1 **hybrid**s to propagate for 25 generations (F25) without selection for mating time or callus colour, finding that the advanced **hybrid** population had moved towards B. tryoni phenotypes for both traits. Selection for day mating in replicate lines at F25 resulted in significant phenotypic shifts in both traits towards B. neohumeralis phenotypes in F26. However, we were unable to completely recover the mating time profile of B. neohumeralis and relaxation of selection for day mating led to a shift back towards dusk mating, but not yellow callus colour, by F35.ConclusionWe conclude that the inheritance of the two major species-defining traits is separable but tightly linked and involves more than one gene in each case. It also appears that laboratory conditions select for the B. tryoni phenotypes for mating time. We discuss our findings in relation to speciation theory and the likely effects of domestication during the generation of mass release strains for sterile insect control programmes.

**Effect of sampling methods, effective population size and migration rate estimation in Glossina palpalis palpalis from Cameroon**

Melachio, TTT; Njiokou, F; Ravel, S; Simo, G; Solano, P; De Meeus, T. 2015

Human and animal trypanosomiases are two major constraints to development in Africa. These diseases are mainly transmitted by tsetse flies in particular by Glossina palpalis palpalis in Western and Central Africa. To set up an effective vector control campaign, prior population genetics studies have proved useful. Previous studies on population genetics of G. p. palpalis using microsatellite loci showed high heterozygote deficits, as compared to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, mainly explained by the presence of null alleles and/or the mixing of individuals belonging to several reproductive units (Wahlund effect). In this study we implemented a system of trapping, consisting of a central trap and two to four satellite traps around the central one to evaluate a possible role of the Wahlund effect in tsetse flies from three Cameroon human and animal African trypanosomiases foci (Campo, Bipindi and Fontem). We also estimated effective population sizes and dispersal. No difference was observed between the values of allelic richness, genetic diversity and Wright's F-IS, in the samples from central and from satellite traps, suggesting an absence of Wahlund effect. Partitioning of the samples with Bayesian methods showed numerous clusters of 2-3 individuals as expected from a population at demographic equilibrium with two expected offspring per reproducing female. As previously shown, null alleles appeared as the most probable factor inducing these heterozygote deficits in these populations. Effective population sizes varied from 80 to 450 individuals while immigration rates were between 0.05 and 0.43, showing substantial genetic exchanges between different villages within a focus. These results suggest that the "suppression" with establishment of physical barriers may be the best strategy for a vector control campaign in this forest context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

**Fitness characteristics of the malaria vector Anopheles funestus during an attempted laboratory colonization**

Ngowo, HS; Hape, EE; Matthiopoulos, J; Ferguson, HM; Okumu, FO. 2021

BackgroundThe malaria vector Anopheles funestus is increasingly recognized as a dominant vector of residual transmission in many African settings. Efforts to better understand its biology and control are significantly impeded by the difficulties of colonizing it under laboratory conditions. To identify key bottlenecks in colonization, this study compared the development and fitness characteristics of wild An. funestus from Tanzania (FUTAZ) and their F-1 offspring during colonization attempts. The demography and reproductive success of wild FUTAZ offspring were compared to that of individuals from one of the only An. funestus strains that has been successfully colonized (FUMOZ, from Mozambique) under similar laboratory conditions.MethodsWild An. funestus (FUTAZ) were collected from three Tanzanian villages and maintained inside an insectary at 70-85% RH, 25-27 degrees C and 12 h:12 h photoperiod. Eggs from these females were used to establish three replicate F-1 laboratory generations. Larval development, survival, fecundity, mating success, percentage pupation and wing length were measured in the F-1 -FUTAZ offspring and compared with wild FUTAZ and FUMOZ mosquitoes.ResultsWild FUTAZ laid fewer eggs (64.1; 95% CI [63.2, 65.0]) than FUMOZ females (76.1; 95% CI [73.3, 79.1]). Survival of F-1-FUTAZ larvae under laboratory conditions was low, with an egg-to-pupae conversion rate of only 5.9% compared to 27.4% in FUMOZ. The median lifespan of F-1-FUTAZ females (32 days) and males (33 days) was lower than FUMOZ (52 and 49 for females and males respectively). The proportion of female F-1-FUTAZ inseminated under laboratory conditions (9%) was considerably lower than either FUMOZ (72%) or wild-caught FUTAZ females (92%). This resulted in nearly zero viable F-2-FUTAZ eggs produced. Wild FUTAZ wings appear to be larger compared to the lab reared F-1-FUTAZ and FUMOZ.ConclusionsThis study indicates that poor larval survival, mating success, low fecundity and shorter survival under laboratory conditions all contribute to difficulties in colonizing of An. funestus. Future studies should focus on enhancing these aspects of An. funestus fitness in the laboratory, with the biggest barrier likely to be poor mating.

**Population variation in sexual selection and its effect on size allometry in two dung fly species with contrasting sexual size dimorphism**

Kraushaar, U; Blanckenhorn, WU. 2002

Body size is one of the most important quantitative traits under evolutionary scrutiny. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in a given species is expected to result if opposing selection forces equilibrate differently in both sexes. We document variation in the intensity of sexual and fecundity selection, male and female body size, and thus SSD among 31 and 27 populations of the two dung fly species, Scathophaga stercoraria and Sepsis cynipsea, across Switzerland. Whereas in S. cynipsea females are larger, the SSD is reversed in S. stercoraria. We comprehensively evaluated Fairbairn and Preziosi's (1994) general, three-tiered scenario, hypothesizing that sexual selection for large male size is the major driving force of SSD allometry within these two species. Sexual selection intensity on male size in the yellow dung fly, S. stercoraria, was overall positive, greater, and more variable among populations than fecundity selection on females. Also, sexual selection intensity in a given population correlated positively with mean male body size of that population for both the field-caught fathers and their laboratory-reared sons, indicating a response to selection. In S, cynipsea, sexual selection intensity on males was lower overall and significantly positive, about equal in magnitude, but more variable than fecundity selection on females. However, there was no correlation between the intensity of sexual selection and mean male body size among populations. In both species, the laboratory-reared offspring indicate genetic differentiation among populations in body size. Despite fulfillment of all key prerequisites, at least in S. stercoraria, we did not find hypoallometry for SSD (Rensch's rule, i.e., greater evolutionary divergence in male size than female size) for the field-caught parents or the laboratory-reared offspring: Female size was isometric to male size in both species. We conclude that S. cynipsea does not fit some major requirements of Fairbairn and Preziosi's ( 1994) scenario, whereas for S. stercoraria we found partial support for it. Failure to support Rensch's rule within the latter species may be due to phylogenetic or other constraints, power limitations, erroneous estimates of sexual selection, insufficient genetic isolation of populations. or sex differences in viability selection against large size.
