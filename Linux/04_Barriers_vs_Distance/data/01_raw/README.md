### WARNING
The lepidoptera barriers file have no authors column. This was on purpoise. The reason was that while Andrea was filling the excel files from butterflies she copied some invisible characters into the authors column. This causes R scripts downwards to fail without warning. If you want to see butterflies authors go to the files in the /Windows directory.
