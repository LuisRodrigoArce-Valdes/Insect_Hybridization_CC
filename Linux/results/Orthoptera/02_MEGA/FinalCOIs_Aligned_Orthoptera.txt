Table. Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence between Sequences
The number of base substitutions per site from between sequences are shown. Standard error estimate(s) are shown above the diagonal and were obtained by a bootstrap procedure (500 replicates). Analyses were conducted using the Maximum Composite Likelihood model [1]. This analysis involved 41 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated (complete deletion option). There were a total of 186 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA11 [2]
