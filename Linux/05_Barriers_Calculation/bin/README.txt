Odonates and hymenopterans lack some reproductive barriers. Odonates lack hybrid sterility and partial sterility due to the way in which they were measured, AND hymenopterans lack partial hybrid sterility (due to their reproduction). While estimating RI odonates and hymenopterans lacked RI values corresponding to the barriers they did not had. However, after the phylogenetic correction RI values were averaged an lie within those barriers in which they were not present.
