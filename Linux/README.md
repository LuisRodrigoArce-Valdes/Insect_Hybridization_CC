### Directories functions:
- `01_Consensus`: Consesus strategy to estimate genetic distances for genetic distances plots at hybridizing species. **BOLD only**
- `02_Longest`: Longest strategy to estimate genetic distances for genetic distances plots at hybridizing species. **BOLD only**
- `03_Genetic_Distances`: Estimation of genetic distances from the two previous strategies and plots.
- `04_Additional_Species_Distances`: Miguel and Jesus were missing some species for their analyses here, I estimate genetic distances for their species, using the consensus strategy. **BOLD & GENEBANK**
- `05_Barriers_vs_Distance`: Here I estimate genetic distances for the species were isolation barrieres were measured. **BOLD only**
- `06_Barriers_Calculation`: Here I make correlations between the isolation of each pair of species and their genetic distance estimated from the previous directory.
